Food Debt to European Inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the price was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzins. In its discretion, the interest rate cut would favor the rise in commodity prices and the slight decrease in unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a slump: inflation needs to be “agreed” in order to rule out the need for further action.
At 3.3 per cent, inflation in Germany reached a 12-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
The rise in inflation in the euro area is due to the rise in food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat prices rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup is facing a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the Socialists, according to Gallup, has reached a never-before-seen low of 13 percent.
Thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters, the difference is clear among the party-faithful voters: More than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one-fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP’s approval.
According to a survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has increased by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has further deteriorated - never before has the proportion of those who rate the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41%), while another 46% consider it "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny in general, while the share of supporters of Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the head of the party of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest of last October, 35% were still in favour of the stay of the government and the head of government, this share now stands at only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they would “safely participate” and another 20 percent would “probably” cast their vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to be held on Sunday, only 55 per cent would "safely" go to the polls, another 15 per cent would consider their participation "probable", and given these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fee, 79% against the internship fee, and 84% against the hospital tuition fee.
Transferred to the group of participants in the referendum "safely", the share of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Alsoan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
In the Budaörser Handelsdreieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, however, price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "drop-off" last December, the price did not drop drastically, compared to the already high, previous baseline.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid far below HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets studied.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price drop on the product to below 200 forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola pancake bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including pancake cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora’s prices in the “Napi” shopping cart compared to Christmas prices last year increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206,00 Forint, but the increase in VAT was noticeable in prices last Christmas.
This is exactly what struck the trade: it seems that the department stores could not quite decide what price range to apply to the individual items, as the effects of the price increase on consumer behavior were unforeseeable.
(If the trader does not plan the speed of circulation of a product, it can fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" basket last year fell so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 Forint more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some staple foods, the Statistical Office found a more than 30 percent increase over the 12-month period.
In the same way, in addition to flour, also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look in the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year, even in the worst case, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase down on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
Large quantities are purchased from all over, sustainable food goes in pallets over the store tables.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower frequency of customers is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly after, the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be carried out since due to the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
By December 10 of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens from hospitals were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, a senior physician at the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is expected to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin inflammation, or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are overdosed or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria arise from the well-responsive bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital's daily routine.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, advised Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients who have been admitted and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance fund for this study.
Most cases will therefore only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but this directive is also not always respected by hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients, or patients in basic care, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds barely lined, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less financially well-off hospitals, there are even savings in disinfectants, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
MRSA infections are a huge cost to health insurance companies, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
According to first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals.
Death row police chief wasn't drunk
In the case of the car accident with a fatal outcome caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now-retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Budapest Higher Prosecutor’s Office, said on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed any alcohol before he took office.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, downhill .)
The pedestrian is injured after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the conductor suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and applied for retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor’s Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had been cooperating with the investigators from the beginning.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three EUR 400 million loan agreements in Budapest on Friday aimed at education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting, the metro line 4 also spoke.
It was agreed that once Hungary clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible amendments will be discussed again.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year deferral, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most coveted patchwork for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, at the seaside are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also in increasing demand.
According to estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria wid also attract domestic investors sooner or later, so for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russian registers more buyers.
The capital city of Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of Europe’s most attractive golfing paradises, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also aiming for a change in their lives.
Most of the buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgiy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or downgraded houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are written great, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an increase of 21% annually.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percentage
As Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing Bali’s roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
At the moment, a fierce debate between industrialized and developing countries is underway.
The US has already signalled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the developed countries are ready to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries was also reached.
The Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund is to be managed by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as reflected in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of the Environment G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" will be achieved successfully or not. The Union would even be willing to commit to a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialized countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to commit to their commitments.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already committed itself with its 15 member states to a decrease of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will meet, as stated in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the most important of which is known to the IPCC, the UNFCCC and its international partners.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and an increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube: special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets is checked at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where it is put on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defense headquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Office and the international peacekeepers (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Defense Ministry says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of the foreign operations.
This type of propaganda is almost free compared to conventional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise with Game
But the army also has to fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also makes it into the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are at most talked about, the bloody sides of the war are not, however.
By the way, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "ghosting".
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others spell Christmas mood with tombola or impulses into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the Defense Department, but the ministry’s employees are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are beating the strings.
The costly 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The main focus of the festivities is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organized by the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the authorities.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with an address by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was announced that there was no ball dress or dress code at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forint.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference for the year’s end.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - will be served only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forints.
Self-governance minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply run into the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own festive hall, which is expected to accommodate 436 employees.
Spending was measured at 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres’ term of office, the PM’s employees celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party mood – not only because of the minister’s official speech but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year’s reception on January 20, the ministry’s Christmas celebration this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions held each year traditionally begin with a brief address by the Minister and sound with a restrained sigh.
As the relevant press outlets report at [origo]’s request, there will be no Christmas celebration either at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and on Monday - the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work layoff will begin.
There are expected to be significant roadblocks due to strikes, as rail traffic is almost completely halted, and Budapest’s public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large-scale protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will lay off work indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will not come to the vote on the health insurance law until later in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which start on Monday, will lead to significant traffic disruptions: railway workers are putting down their work indefinitely, most public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n societies are standing still in the morning.
At the same time, in many places there will be highway barriers in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary layoff.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on adequate services, although more and more people are travelling by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from start of operation until 1 pm, at Budapest Airport between 7 am and 9 am early strikes, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, or the Democratic teachers' union, have called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians strikes alternately at various times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible occupational groups will be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League trade unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the side lines and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the “Movement for a Better Hungary”, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things: In the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic discrimination in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been established.
"These groups have in common that they define themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly brag about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (disaster protection, national defense, law enforcement), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, the state itself."
And further: all this is done according to that method which tries to disguise various political aspirations as bourgeois initiative, based on the political and party intolerance of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not only used to circumvent legal obstacles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, as some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region," it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as the occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
In their opinion, in the last 17 years, a real "gypsy terror" was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and should risk-changing trends be discernible, public opinion would be informed, as in the case of issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of rearranging the working days around the holidays has now become established, but next year will provide us with fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood under "Holidays".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Unemployed days are usually ecclesial holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are days off work - the latter alone so that the New Year's celebrants can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are March 15, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, the commemoration day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the founding of the state, on May 1, the work is celebrated, on November 1 and 2, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “workday shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holidays, is to be finalized, the Minister of Labour has for many years been set out in his own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public servants and civil servants alike.
Only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order is only slightly confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life in this country will formally stand still, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's equilibrium, or the holiday specifically cancelled for this purpose, will take time off.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer redundancies on working days than this year.
The calendar is first put on the head around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second redeployment is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work in advance on Friday, October 24th.
However, the end of the year will be completely in the sign of the holidays, after December 24th everything will lie and stand still, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things to annoy co-workers
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we don't notice anymore: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether to get used to these little inconveniences, or to better cope with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, consciously for other annoying situations.
- Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called,” says one colleague.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it again, perhaps by calling the marketing department and confessing regretfully that you had forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Usually, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before getting caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can really do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more nervous than grabbing a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone wrong.
So, don’t put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there if you need it urgently.
Discussing the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a trap that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tied to everyone’s nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to be silent like a grave, rather than aligning the just present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
When you call the office to report yourself sick with agonizing headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, non-deferred accomplishments, projects with fixed deadlines now have to be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
Don’t play badly for your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get to the office the next day, or that something could happen, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Sum, Gekicher, Telephone
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the noisy gossip of the colleagues?
Did you hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you carry across their heads), trampling, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very annoying, even if you are not exactly immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the fault of others?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, do not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the missing, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfortable for at home, but has nothing to lose in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just do not get too slutty - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the point that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wanting to do it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The domestic music scene has not spoiled us with quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage skirt with its guitar requiche is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in Pécs, even playing in the band Yonderboi, before - perhaps because a host does not tolerate two pipes - he began to tread his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he only managed to reach him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider public only when the magazine "wan2" reached its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the almost only marketable trendsetter in the West.
Zagar and his band were no doubt "trendy", but no one cared if they also liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new avenues for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term originates from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was still with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends, the influences of the rock 'n' roll can be seen.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio beater - the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who broadcast pop music from early to late, has successively put the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music remain reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "stage music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be silky and nonsensical, but they can also be produced only for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener’s readiness to receive also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of your music to Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them, much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it’s a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn exists only in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is travelling as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go our own way, except that we try to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
Initially, of course, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi’s were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi "Wings of Love" is in first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which is then to hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of gifted soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was formed - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodasi [Neo], Juci Németh -, which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls co-design it?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally called for a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they taught the girls.
It all came practically at once and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember I was quite electrified back then, but it took the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the stage at the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind it was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one’s ego a little bit, forgetting who came from where and where it is going, we just let those particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the case of musical work, there are actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes with the concerts all the time and now that I have released the album.
Currently, it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Soilless Fraud
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It came for almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, besides, he certainly was not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in a timely manner.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who indicated him to the police.
But as Kerviel’s statements, published by the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, show, he was a man who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just in the wake of the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who have had repayment problems in the past, would be in trouble.
The entire economy should not be affected by this crisis.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept right.
By the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I earned the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t keep anything to himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that they wouldn't come to his senses.
He even managed to lead his bosses to the light, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid of flying?
I don't think so.
“I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“When I first spoke in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance, he made a lot of money by betting half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or guessed it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
At the beginning of this year, however, came the big blow.
In a single day, he lost a billion dollars.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About CZK 125 billion comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the expansion of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have more than 90.8 billion next year.
The "Business and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative businesses.
This will help companies to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for enterprise research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
With the previous acquisition of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful to date among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for ex-presidents
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who had been sentenced to $100 million in 2003 for financial fraud.
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his farm at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state is behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n is allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had set up to finance his 2001 campaign.
The budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was still approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats), because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to reject him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law in peace.
This is, in a sense, paradoxical.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally obligatory, not only for pensions, but also for social spending, which was decided by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax revenues, levies and bank loans, spent more sources of investment, often inadvertently issuing debt securities, through which they owed their town halls excessively.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of shares of the energy and other utilities networks that they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already depleted.
Insofar as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts of without fail.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have done much more sensible business than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which is mainly attributed to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are the least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have unfortunately been superfluously inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even though it has managed to remove some of the senseless populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end up as powerless, and, no matter who is not in power, will remain in power.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then from ruling politicians will become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the suppression of normal spending by compulsory spending.
The planned deficit of SEK 70 billion for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent what was going on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it to happen that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we have to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, rest in preparation for further reform.
Only these allow the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In this way, more than $100 billion will be auctioned off in the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central bank.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated approach to deter or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties facing the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report to his clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a U.S. recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting billions of dollars in losses.
“Central banks must have been really afraid of what could still happen when they decided to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as further interest rate cuts,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by the central banks helps to warm up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The critique now referred to the ending of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he argued that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mix of government representatives and such from non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that the subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now interested parties can read his attitude undisturbed.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and judge professional papers, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
He described as the main statement of the book the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not represent a threat to climate change, and that efforts to
In addition, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Asked by attendees, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic at the Hayek Institute in Vienna two months ago.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver’s license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the change, so that the authorities can issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid driving licenses will enter the streets after the New Year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their driver's license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of driving licences, the capital’s offices are being flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new driver’s license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required change by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use it in case of violation with an admonition.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the one from the municipality can be punished who does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the authorities to apply milde and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand crowns penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive anymore should give out their driver’s license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers must also gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having done a joint case with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Superior Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s ruling, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted in this case, but he has to face the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he had already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
For more, he cannot be condemned.
A district court in January found 19 people guilty of involvement in robberies, and the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants disputed the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, gave information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the prey.
The indictment deals with crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also for official acts and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns due to their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in the proceedings, Berdych and a number of others were found guilty of further robberies.
More men from Berdych's district must be held accountable in another trial, more cases have not yet been brought to court.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and await the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far been absent from the main proceedings.
Children exchanged - Bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to claim from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore disagrees entirely with Velebas' proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's negotiation.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side has produced.
We will see if it has any value at all.
But we insist that this should be for everyone in the hundreds of thousands range," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion, which had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of different strengths and depths.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even though they saw themselves facing accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope with the aftermath of the trauma experienced worse, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Moorish Heights) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred by them due to the mistake of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they ask the carrier for help.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came to his kingdom of Wales
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the fight for the brand "Kingdom of Wales".
According to the judge at the Ostrava District Court, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not take part in the hearing today.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate parasitically in Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute over money.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to gain parasitically from our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
This was not, however, connected with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
From an initially fun action crystallized a business and an entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered his owners discounts on visits to his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas has certainly helped the project of the Walachian kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> project and its team were dedicated to it.
The cooperation of the dissident parties lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, which culminated in the deposition "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nimmerlein's Day".
The leading role was then taken on the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>'s Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and a half princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move to Walachei.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up in peace," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Preliminary parts disappear
To tell you the truth, I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearbox, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The van with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the low headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the van is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior fittings for a short time so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, where I only have objections because of the troublesome middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The lateral support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the range of space, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo compartment.
I have to describe it (also because of the foldable back window) as very chargeable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot is left with a noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, that’s what a 1600-cubic engine should look like that drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, who sometimes seems to have his exhaust clogged with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine in the amount of 329,900 crowns still stands.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car strikes again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head fairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper trigger, electric window lifters at the rear and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but just add up the extra equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
All that remains is the choice of which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which causes fears among locals about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools are even finding cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where conflicts between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually escalating.
Disputes, bullying and bullying among students have shifted to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham have arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself with the fact that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks against the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushwalk and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he tossed us apples and pears and then exposed his butt," a mother of a Slovak student described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here in search of work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and alluring cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You will find this abundantly on the islands of the Caribbean.
Only on one island can you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had looted in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during prohibition) was liked and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, cars drove across the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
Cocktails can be mixed at the bar of the Hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported schigulis and fiats in the salty and humid air have long since fallen apart.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have come down heavily, nowhere else can you find around so many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just being cleaned up, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only new hotels have been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway enthusiasts.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow lanes to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose co-workers have been in the museum for a long time elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places are not missed by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana.
It should only be mentioned that there is a museum in Hemingway’s estate, whose visit should not be missed by the person who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the 1950s that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo Bay have to overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape that is barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle stands, the current Hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves could confess about many of these pages.
But, as they say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
In the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draft a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries stationed in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO units to be more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start developing the economy and security themselves," Des Browne, the British defence minister, told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We’re going to have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop said the same today.
“I’m not happy with what we have available on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters on Tuesday, concluding three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as faulpelze.
"Afghan non-stuar debunked: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the "Sun" wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung counter-attacked and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt to Rise to 1 Billion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion queens this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The Czech Republic’s national debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on the state debts from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than CZK 111 billion.
“Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be able to cross the one-trillion-crore limit until 2009.
Next year, debt is expected to move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner," David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, told the server iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could exceed a trillion in 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation is changing on the political stage, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he said.
Debt grows
Government debt stems from government debt and is mainly due to the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has risen to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The state’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and decreased by SEK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
Overall debt rose 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is particularly evident in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debts are rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount stems mainly from the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It also includes a maximum of SEK 13.3 billion for the Consolidation Agency, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government debt securities of SEK 43 billion and rates for bonds with the European Investment Bank of SEK 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan with insulting Islam, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman has been accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old pupils to name a teddy bear Mohammed, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be flogged.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this affair begins in September, when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Sure, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all, he is also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My Name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything that would have made her too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it was just a mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common surname given in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of veneration of the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
At the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating meeting since the troika had received the mandate for a new mediation from the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia has been and continues to be an advocate of a negotiated solution, an amicable solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries hold independence under EU supervision for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is prepared to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations have been conducted on the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, a former leader of the Kosovar Rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added, however, that the Belgrade-proposed plan for autonomy was part of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effects
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly forcing a "domino effect" in a region that has been so much weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely in the Security Council, where their Russian ally holds a veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations have taken two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
To the journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will run in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unleashes agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, held Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He went on to say that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding both parties of their commitments to the peace roadmap they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty that aims to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term encompasses the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict, which is in the present-day state of Israel.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption, and that he would make every effort to ensure that they could be concluded before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which stand side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received assurances in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led to a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a dividing line in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, there are official versions and rumors.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no bet, but was on track, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorization, i.e. not approved for public road transport (see below), came, driven by two youths without a helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after ignoring its right-hand drive, a police officer further explained.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the wagon (bent wing, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IPPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main security department of the Valoise district.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the investigation of the IPPN at this stage the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this small power wheel has reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked into each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel there was a rumor that the police would have left the scene of the accident very quickly without the help of the two young men.
Although the IPPC remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation, and in which one has to proceed very carefully.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who was backing up.
Two more tried to revive one of the teenagers, the fourth telephoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, apparently, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the youth, the policemen were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still, according to this witness testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They have also applied heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not provide assistance to the youth.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire brigade arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police shot down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
A number of them would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers at the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (middle) and in Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday received the support of religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency, and to those who have taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
“All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to hand over the army’s command and become a civilian president has not been effective since the emergency was called, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the distance of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools provided by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Space Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to power them.
The crew’s second task, therefore, was to implement a 17.5-tonne solar-powered module that was already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew decided to restructure the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And in doing so, it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded up like accordions was damaged by a clamped cable at a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was halted to prevent further damage to the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left the Discovery spacecraft for a control flight and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the spacecraft that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So, the 46-year-old learned doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he severed the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, wrapped up a mini hockey racket, with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar collectors, which generate several hundred volts, the astronauts on board the station had invented and crafted.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector had fully folded up before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery spacecraft to presumably begin the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the debris of the A400M, the share EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the debris caused by the slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delays the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The cost announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounts to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBITs) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
Recall that the business performance of EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large aircraft carrier A380.
Initially, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
On Sunday, the counting of the ballots will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very close election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when he received the foreign ambassadors, the president did not let anything through, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers, who are accused of meddling – his favorite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost themselves there.
It deplores an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Gunnadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such a dirty election, not even in the time of Yeltsin.
After suppressing the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised demonstrations, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The Official Gazette announced yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: in this country, which has been Christianized after Europe for five centuries, civil society has only very slowly developed; the famous common spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again attached to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians freely renounce the personal responsibility that they briefly brought to light after the collapse of the USSR.
What are you thinking about for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often tantamount to chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What is there to think about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they replace them?
A heavy memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be accessed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and name-related, that is, at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the 11 states in charge of its administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the process of ratification of this Decision has been completed, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow for research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, explained Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with trade between India and Europe already reaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will push the two economies enormously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, said the European Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr. Barro, Mr.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to alleviate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to provide a significant part of its savings for a five-month period during the maintenance phase.
The bank further explains that this way on December 6 at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the basic tax rate and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has been circulating liquidity for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the day-to-day different interest rates of interbank lending at its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate, which differed from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has climbed to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented the banks from taking advantage of them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was created as part of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of which were for the employment allowance, for the re-introduction of the TIPP floating, for a transport check or for the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered occasion for partly violent exchanges of words between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present all of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which was considered by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a model for the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 said on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic head Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We were negotiating mt the city and the commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have been stuck in policy debates regarding the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival in Grand Park Chicago after it joined the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, while ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to somehow merge these two concepts together, to convey at the same time the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes it.
These lock attempts are part of the delegate tasks.
A political "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all West Coast festivals, though Sundance’s, Denver’s, Seattle’s, or San Francisco’s, will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them, and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec has also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-of-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the upcoming end-of-year rally.
However, experts are unable to make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure funds, which are highly value-added due to the upturn in the market.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will tend to show a rather lateral price trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US central bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of rising.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% from its highest mark on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully finish the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional contribution of the pension fund made every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently, especially due to the already in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution, taking place the end of the year rally.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect the market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous market assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values in the near future, the extent of which could depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst relies on these to be positive.
In selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new highs, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney says that this year the big values are on the line.
Among the value winners would be the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption during the Christmas days, in the last half of the year the periodic consumption will determine the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines in price.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-of-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December saw a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive winning year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also feature an end-of-year rally will be revealed.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economical regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, since Popular represents the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays until 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly announces the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The bank’s ongoing negotiations with the unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement in which 75% of all branches will close on Saturdays and will open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business hours, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the commercial customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is combined with a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, more colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s representative in charge, said that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by increased staffing, as one branch no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O <0xCC><0x81>Donell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60, who operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants and also having extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.

The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus outperforms its rival Antena 3.
We've made it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The transmitter led by him had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: this is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not sink too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million to half.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as magazine) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be inferred from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still arises as to what extent we can actually act on a stock market basis, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV station to generate more than 1,000 million gross advertising revenues this year, as assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales rose by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business could only show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s comparatively better stock market performance is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to now: In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a triggered a 100% dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, even though it is still too early for official announcement.
We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far always stated significantly more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buying) as a result of the multiple incentives and the thriving market a more advantageous position at than Antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in the face of similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which entered into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting that ended today with the Congressional decision in the Senate on the additional/amendment proposals associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressional and senate deputies, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, which ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally more efficient market.
In addition to modernising financial markets, the MIFID, which re-defines the Securities Services Regulation, seeks to improve investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to both specialised firms and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS) to the advisory firms that merge with investment and securities brokerage companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the multilateral systems of securities transactions and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders are added to the regulated circulation markets, which would eventually compete with the current economic actors.
The law obliges investment firms to register the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and forms of risk management in the market, and all completed projects, in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission envisioned further changes in retrospect, with the decision that the securitized debt securities must now be considered complex financial assets for the investor due to their high level of risk, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the Directive on the legal restriction of the fields of work of qualified economists came into force 30 years after 1977, when the Regulation restricting the fields of work reserved for economic scientists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not need authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time to several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim at a local and quality comparison with US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) cautioned that the pre-determined indicator should serve only as a guide value, and therefore should not be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation differential to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in terms of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have fallen by more than half since the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they are now only worth <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has dropped significantly in two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and despite the government’s 100 percent guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group under the brand name Virgin Money after the takeover, will have to contribute about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will be made up of the assets of the next three years, to acquire exactly the <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion needed to achieve its target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to flow <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, which has three other companies involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
Mayor of Totana Arrested on Alleged Suspected of Participating in Urban Corruption
The Spanish police have arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the municipality of Murcia this morning, on the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, last May, and could be the original wire drawer of the plot, according to information from Cadena SER.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information provided by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, MEP Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client’s residence due to important burdensome documents related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report Morales’ alleged commission payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in detention.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Socialists' President and Secretary-General, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo, and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, the office of President of the Congress.
José Blanco, the PSOE’s organizational secretary, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would appear to be running for Congressional chairman for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as Congressional President, who announced on November 15 that he would stop running in the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead work in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the prime minister had continuously pushed for his return to political events.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice President for Economic Affairs, did not want to withhold from citizens who would assume the post of Congressional President in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or screaming, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk quietly and quietly is Congress, so the President of the Government has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work and indicated that he did not want to arouse the appearance that he had already taken office, otherwise his political counterparts would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is being harshly criticized by both climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate in the foreground on this issue, the movement as a whole must bring to light a strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in need of an explanation as to the action or non-action of his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading position within the EU in those countries that have least met the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, which sectors this is due to, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages against climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected, which behaviour of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences will follow.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice themselves and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there are and will be no such explanations in the future.
This is because it is all about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can really be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE appeared strategically so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, otherwise suitable politicians for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and enthralling others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana on account of an alleged involvement in an urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel manager were also arrested for suspected violations of urban planning.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in whose premises he is to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction department Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the arrests already held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid period, in which it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored construction land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria. This should be redesigned illegally during the last tenure of the property of the 4000 apartments built on the site
In addition, two more persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigative procedure initiated and carried out by the first Totonas court.
The first six arrestees were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also being investigated.
His ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, are also suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the Vigo-born lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the town of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have acted as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the lubricant.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives in addition to the arrests carried out eleven more searches, most of them in companies directly related to those in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas prison (Madrid).
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia-owned town, which would include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt, with the aim of implementing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the car parks of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and that of the Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion and sale of the

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the commentary published in the same newspaper, on November 18, on the issue of blacks;
The content of the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the gruesome murders is a graduate who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical stance on Plato and suggested that the teaching of Plato from the lower-level curricula for the subject of Philosophy should be applied to high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which is punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you again rob a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000, the theft will be considered a criminal offence, but the penalty will be lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a racket than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious confrontation involves a prison sentence of three to 12 months in a row (Article 154 Penal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Pursuant to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, the authorization of which did not take place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should be right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite nicely.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research papers titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to recognize that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct in their response and therefore also received the same amount; but if one of them received the double, it also resulted in stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years and is based in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - are former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian-Bosnian leader.
Her names are on a list that Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach has provided for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her efforts to pressure and elude the government, who are trying to escape.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, such as age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance policy holder.
This agreement shall be established in writing by means of an insurance contract which states that the Company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to provide the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of damages.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver's license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accident, higher contributions will also be due.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay less, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents as single persons.
The benefits assigned to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be taken into account when choosing an insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under 25 years of age encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and a young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out full cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full cash with self-insurance, so that the services of a full cash insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay a part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher and lower the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, Spain's chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is the extended insurance that insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against damage to the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to cut down on insurance costs; that’s how your credit rises by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate drops.
Therefore, it is best to opt for full cash insurance with self-insurance.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the beginner's fear has been removed.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out full cash insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person in question also allows it.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with self-insurance (for an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, it is recommended to use an extended insurance, which is not used until the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full cash insurance with self-employment (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which is used only with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they are missing in order to reach their respective goals before finishing the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while this one decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not get Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round of play, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the 13th semi-final to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
This group will be finished before all the others and the tie at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the result that everyone expects, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home that the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would have a better starting position in the eighth final in case of a group victory.
Gordon Strachan's team could even have a loss to qualify for a slap at FC Shakhtar, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, as the Ukrainians are allowed to participate at nine points; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
Accordingly, the Milanese will try to beat the Scots in the evening. They again hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being in exactly the same round in the previous season through a goal from Kaka in the postseason (1-0) and through a zero-to-zero draw.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to focus on their own game as both reaching the eighth final and joining UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls gave the start of their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood is in tune again.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which had caused furor at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which is released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage that had previously been given to them by Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans who set the GM Palace on fire, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham made it clear that the British star has not seen our dressing room once, and that is why I am already quite excited about what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not, so I'm glad to have made this decision," Chisholm said of the breakup of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes have been resolved and now everyone is very happy again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver, according to a report from CTV, in a special machine operated by Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine, and any dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned Gazprom gas monopoly are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Anatoli Kinakh, Ukraine's economic minister, told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed prices up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom replenishes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation from Chief Financial Officer Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought to Glasgow Airport in June in connection with the attack.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish state health service has no accurate idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Officer examined staff recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The Public Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to hiring foreign employees to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency has no jurisdiction to receive this information outside the UK.
The Chief Auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines on the criminal record excerpt, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report said.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their pre-employment screening guidelines to a high degree, but added, “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information is available about the number of foreign health care workers.”
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations ahead of hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says that NHS Scotland’s current pre-employment tests are working well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are allowed indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely adhered to.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign staff at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was my concern to carry out this work in light of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on screening screenings prior to recruitment by all staff - including those from abroad - whose release is due to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world.
The awards were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis’ rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has presented Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far best known for the iconic cover of U2 album Joshua Tree, with two awards - as the best director and the best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning ceremony – when Julian Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells planned to smuggle missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid-intervention force to protect facilities following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing an interior ministry statement, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “rocket expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees, according to the report, were planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis striving to join al-Qaeda militias that want to fight the allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen as heretical by the hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be cooperating with the authorities in supporting the royal family’s policy that the government dominates.
The militias - accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very great effort by the security forces over the last ... five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a “media cell” of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote “Takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a perspective on the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet resembles a distant twin Earth even more than previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower rate of rotation, Venus embarked on a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-heavy winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been examining the plants for a year, offer a sobering glimpse of how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the directors of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
'Enriched uranium' seized by police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material is being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally declared himself ready to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who polled Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican party that is set to break up in next year’s elections.
It’s not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with selecting YouTube clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most important topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a ballot when they heard things they liked: The TV station noted spikes of approval as the candidates spoke strictly about the boundaries.
The evening’s sharpest and longest exchange was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed ahead in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of being relentless about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two set out particularly fiercely as questioners wondered if one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration puck earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share broadly the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the respondents asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the position that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race is exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his cheering storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two were shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party had not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to invade; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician paid for Parisian hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been slapped.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman has hidden donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister withdrew from the demand for an election, foolishly insulting the British intelligence, claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen Liberal Democrats representative, put it, the once-feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The inept rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have upset business associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative whaling.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Enforcement Officer) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably resigning.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: public service begins to leak; cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misfortune — like in the long “money for noble titles” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown’s situation isn’t quite as bad as it looks
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely deceived.
And the counter-measure, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s of course Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new evidence of political donations is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for one clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s deal, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financier, who was told about the bizarre donations in October.
But so far, Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted that determination by seizing a well-known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject – to fill the measure, from a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to draw from it" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Aside from that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour’s hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions – bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through indisputable fairness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis hitting the American credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is hurting, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both settlements and lump-sum rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not receivable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee levy from its U.S. consumer finances, in part because of the weakness of credit card borrowers.
It’s too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter slump rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large portion of card losses; the number of filings (and thus the bailout fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects the volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take up credit card debt now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely revalue the loans,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their pleas to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings lasting two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow’s attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s downfall.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations that helped to rip the company into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had considerable value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others agreed to about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the basis of a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt or make weakening businesses look profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in the Enron crash.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became null and void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It accommodates up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulf Stream stand last Friday at the Millionaires’ Exhibition, a four-day orgy of show-stopping consumption held in a nestled exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newcomers in everything from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest booth.
“This is a nice car, but it’s small money compared to us,” he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money as Dallas at its peak.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in crowds to Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflights of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s most visible free money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry has attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well cared for and men are all worth a fortune.”
As they walk through the halls wearing evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, designate themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand for several hours in the traffic jam to visit a trendy warehouse, the tasteless Cadillac Escalades, a pocket knife made of platinum, Mövenpick Eisbäden und Tessernen, adorned by Bill
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists, were pushing through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are the same chain-linked tires, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-piece replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on those wheels," Karapetian said.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in domestic property prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red cell phones filled with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the money heaps, cell phone photos, while leaning back in the middle of the replacement wealth, getting snapped by friends, or just to plug in a few million.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Plagued Operation Suspected in Death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Harvest Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
“Then I saw the box car of the medical examiner approaching,” Livingston, an overseer of the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The authorities learned that the dead woman, Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that police did not identify, and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which might not be available for weeks, will help clarify a mysterious death that has sent grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hard-working and persistent,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro’s house, where a rotten rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian bell rings behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by mitigating comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank’s chairman, said policy had to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to continued pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure troubled markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize lending conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped reassure Wall Street, given further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales hit a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to offset severe losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a significant 4.7 per cent of the European Central Bank’s three-month guarantee funds granted to European commercial banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and feed more capital into London’s money markets rose as credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates for lending between UK banks rise by 6.59 percent to their highest level since late September, according to a November 21 report.
England Faces Decision on Statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here on call at least under this special title, to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide on this, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually getting with applications for national elections, if not in part.
Whoever doesn’t get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undeniable.
It’s never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of their profession while someone else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to get up to Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricketer is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink?
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances are they do too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batter must get regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better off last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who will appear to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harrison declares himself healthy and how the wind boils into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, although he will still score a double hundred against Australia, may still be below Australia.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion during today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is 22 years seven younger, and an excellent balance against spinning balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his hometown as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a shovel-like joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he recently overturned a four-wheel-drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and enthusiastically say, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he tapers his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time another.
Maybe that’s the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean Shah might not be doing well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others hoping the city will return to normalcy.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now," he said.
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be restored at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local “groups affected citizens” who armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military defend their neighborhoods.
But more were said to have been forced home by visa problems and staggering funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country’s sectarian death squads.
“We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give visas to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field do the Saarlanders face the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saarlander for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan self-ironically posters the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
As a result, the universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But even the country’s children bring the Saarland in above-average numbers to universities – many of them without a high school degree.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their entitlement to study at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively extensive.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in the general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of students will improve sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of high-risk students dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better.
And to the dismay of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligatory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez turns the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez ordered the clocks in the South American country to be turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is becoming a joker.
According to a new law, the clocks are set to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S.-hostile Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing full-time time zones on the world by the United States.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez on Wednesday (local time) announced the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a trade dispute.
The leftist nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for constitutional reform, which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages, was the trigger of the dispute.
Uribe had spitting Venezuela in the face with his decision, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is in everyone’s mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing outrage in the country: "Why not callas" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-America summit by the constant calls of the left-wing populist and had gone over his mouth.
Germany threatens 2007 wage cuts
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The debt to this is the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases for food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on employees in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent for the change of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the proof - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous “supply theory”, lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the devil’s twin on Earth, but it’s a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has struck such a completely different evolution, is the basic question of the ESA mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no probe has been on the way to explore this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research findings, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
“They also show that our neighboring planet’s commonalities with Earth are larger than initially thought,” ESA said in a statement.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud swirl at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-inner planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
However, it revolves much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus is barely reminiscent of Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, lamented the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to the SPIEGEL.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of clashes like in France
Street battles with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of clashes as in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not become violent on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, gunmen shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives do not build up and discharge into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" published in Hannover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities were already working with emphasis on reducing problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this is already the first success."
However, it is too early to warn.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in heavy street battles with the police over the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the federal government were called for by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the upheavals in France, Kolat warned of "inhibition effects".
The situation in Germany is not as dramatic as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among adolescents with a migration background under 25 years of age is "above average" high.
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families takes place".
Many young people with a migration background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
Youth should be given the opportunity to participate in work and education "quickly".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
Competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, a deployment of around 1,000 security forces has ensured peace of mind.
The police will go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
In the night of Tuesday, about 80 policemen were injured in clashes in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots overtook Toulouse.
The crashes were inflamed in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s far-fetched appearance documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content – and that nothing is to be expected from it itself.
In which country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her reluctant appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was cumbersome and low in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by her.
The accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an extremely exaggerated sentence.
This is provincial, she said, only to show that she does not want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has clearly documented to everyone how much their accusations are true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an outspoken politician who flees into foreign policy and even stays in the vicinity there.
Example climate protection: There she praises herself unbridled for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
All in all, the self-praise - so much indecency would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now it clings to the floskel that the upswing is coming in people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems, rather than speaking nicely to the world.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income earners?
She's got a few extras left for that.
This is indicative of how often she promises herself when it comes to the child allowance.
Merkel needs three starts there to bring out a half-straight sentence.
She stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Division of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are having a tough stroke exchange – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already relieved at the first topic.
He has made New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This, in turn, contradicts serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals," Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blaming the attack: Because the Republican base still doesn’t have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-winding 30-second videos that internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power,” McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets read strongly by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated, as torture.
However, the campaign’s important themes are now beyond the Iraq War and torture debates, as shown by the audience’s reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause strikes in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney says, tearing up and pleading in front of the base and television audiences that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into trouble when he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilian life
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
It ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which had occupied Musharraf with lawyers weighed in with him after the state of emergency was imposed in early November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four others were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies is playing again: the three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a clip from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a flowery white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves, concentrating on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds up to a conventional piece of music.
That doesn’t seem to bother the men themselves.
The fact that the band is re-musicizing Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Targeted demands revealed that although the name swirled through the collective pop memory, but by no means so lasting as to painfully miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock, in England and America was always considered more than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003 the Echo Prize for life’s work, they saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old pal.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation abroad is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much lower power of effect than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musician into exile to Forest in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban fugitives.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to torment himself as a nanny.
Rather in a point-of-view artist’s existence.
It is alleged that there was also a wimp of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art in the Sperrmüll.
Some of them were in harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Because so relaxed and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
Collecting travel was not just for self-discovery.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-capacity record setting, as one might think.
From Rother came the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Sphere and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful ever since than it was Harmony.
The Griessem live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing the Krautrock as a pure German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is the Brit, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of the herbal rock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the void in the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s sentence floats with the most unique sounds in the room: “The only true music belongs to the future.”
There are pictures that show the producer with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend formation is used for projections of other black and white photos of wirr wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to unleash unheard-of tones on the instruments via self-tapped effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three deepened tüftlers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, "Aaaaaaaah!" is sung under sound clouds and whispered and sung in a beautiful place.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever here calls "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and harmony cannot be brought to rest even now.
Even the most obvious is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder Peace" again two films deal with the Balkan war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and baller or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but except there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately, because too many nice-looking roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism spurred one’s desire to watch.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunter" (Why do movie titles today always have to be as long and confusing as driver tariff contracts?) perhaps after all.
In essence, his war reporter, Simon Hunt, is what could have been done if fate and the film industry hadn't been so gracious: a man who has long had his best times behind him, but who himself, as a ruinous monument to his downfall, still has considerable repercussions.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murder Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Murder Peace" you can make a short trial: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovar hedgehog shooters, after which one immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that even here the Serbs are not depicted as the sole root of all evil, the television film loses all too quickly in humour and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be almost exemplary to explore why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to track down the Serbian top war criminal "the Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with a different director and a different screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something the military can't and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downed cynic with the heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also refer him to a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
The Hunting Party finally goes down the drain when the reporters succeed in the time-lapse process within the last five minutes, what NATO, CIA and all the world’s bounty hunters have failed in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving the Muslim Bosnians for revenge.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a profoundly human interest.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this case, they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political arrangements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately, I see the swollen foreheads, indicating: how strenuous it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swell heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always it is true: if a star wanders around the crisis herds or minefields of the world, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all limits" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler's List.
Some films are probably still ripening - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now considered classics have not been celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every real-time mass murder comes home on two screens at the same time, even simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs screenwriters of the carefreeness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, “his or not” or “the great dictator” have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really reigned.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcasticly distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
“Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
By Beust Harvested Criticism for Olympic Abduction
The mayor’s withdrawal from Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But of Beust warns realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called a waiver "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed more motivational forces in the city than the Olympic Games.
“Without this objective, the political impulse of sport could not be maintained to the same extent.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "starting from a changed ray of time".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday on previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Games, which is expected in early December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the period until 2028 that we have envisaged so far."
Yet the dream was not dreamed for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to compete for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this point," HSB President Günter Plöß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the Olympia map and excluded housing construction," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for the Little Grasbrook and a later use of housing, the CDU has unilaterally put on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time had sparked great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Isn't that right?
Currently, manufactured wooden crates in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the ninety-four "Typ Stockholm" brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago further aroused doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: the six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director of the Umm Musek Veret dem Hultén
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
These were not works of art, but examples of them, mere exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol probably granted permission to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museum.
Contemporaries now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time were authorized as original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Typ Stockholm" rightly entered the art and auction history.
Some of them have raised more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, has also studied three privately owned brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press span plates were first primed and smeared, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressing chipboard with a paint roller without primer - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion than the Moderna Museum's collection material will be the six copies in the boxes."
As early as July, however, the Authentication Board announced it would follow up on the “severe allegations” made regarding the soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been hiding in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have abandoned their positions at a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot be held responsible for bloodshed, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government loyalists had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had surrounded themselves in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him had apparently run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops cordoned off the district around the noble hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have had enough,” said Trillanes.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers’ elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Critics of the government had called for large demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by accusations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was the main scene of attempted mutiny against Arroyo in 2003.
The insurrection failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
It remains open to the option of increasing the share of versatile even more.
The move is aimed at consolidating the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, suspicions had already arisen about a start-up, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house holds the shares only for a third party, it said on the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already invested almost 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies established the joint venture MSP to take over its competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a 10 percent stake in Freenet and not exercise their right to acquire another 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies, however, remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The ongoing and only difficult to understand poker around Freenet for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full connection customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of the shares in Freenet.
Now it was agreed that Drillisch will bring in another about four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
