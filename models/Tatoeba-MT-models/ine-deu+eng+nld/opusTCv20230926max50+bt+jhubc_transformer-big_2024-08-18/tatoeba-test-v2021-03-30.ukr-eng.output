I was so excited that I couldn’t sleep.
Tom is alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated as a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Do I seem nervous?
The girl we saw as she was waiting for someone near Tom’s house was Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar in it.
Do you know how to skate?
I know how it's done.
Did Tom drink?
I don’t have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
I baked Tom's cake.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What is Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom and Mary said they weren't sick.
I have a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
My mom is busy cooking dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Hurry up and come back.
He is incompetent.
Thomas was training.
He's unbearable.
I am sure he will pass the exam.
Tom voted for the proposal.
Did Tom tell you how long it took him to do that?
Let's start!
Hey, hey!
I'm completely exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don’t believe in anything supernatural, but I am fascinated by the literary poetry of the devil.
The problem is that she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their child John.
I wonder if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the past weekend with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm DJ.
I hate christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You have to learn to restrain yourself.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We will lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the balloon is a non-Euclidean space, so the rules of Euclidean geometry are not fulfilled for it.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I've been trying to reach you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You are twice as old as me.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this city.
He now lives in Tokyo.
Programming is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many clocks do you have in your house?
Tom is deaf.
I don’t like to eat fish.
None of them I like.
Follow us. Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you will be fine.
You panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My tie's orange.
Tom's gonna cry?
Tom would have been taller.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
You brothers?
These are not my ideas.
You have a plan, right?
He walks.
Tom is not in town.
I was wearing my shoes.
Next year will be worse.
Mary in a yellow dress.
Love has a bitter taste.
The meeting is over.
You should have done that last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I have an old car.
We understand why.
I drive every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
We went to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went to the forest in search of insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything.
He chased the thief.
I worked in a restaurant.
I'm not decisive enough.
Doing this will not be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I am interested in music.
I really don’t want to eat now.
The fragments of the mirror were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She was walking to school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is just like the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I have to do that.
The public debt is growing.
Why am I me and not you?
Tom's probably never going to do that.
That's the doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands that.
She spends too much time on the internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he was going to complain.
Let's get to know him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest it.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We know how to speak.
Computers can count very quickly.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather like?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
You want some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change the diapers.
Do people still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she dropped out of school.
The word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
My brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car is outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Leila got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad from raw fish?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom is making breakfast.
There is no doubt that it will rain.
He didn’t mention Australia.
Apparently, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
For better or worse, TV has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He answered my question easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom is looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love children.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus on it.
I’m so glad I did it yesterday.
Does Tom still live near you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a magician.
Don't interrupt me when I say that.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We are insane.
She has wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They've made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000s.
Tom's probably going to do it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.
After a brief peace, the war broke out again.
It is better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you pass me the sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" - "On a chair."
I don’t think there will be any problems.
Tom's broken?
You need to get a haircut.
Green fits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it all work?
You are very ugly.
Hurry up, guys.
I corrected the shirt.
When is his return expected?
I rested well.
He is no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be nice if there were 28 hours in the day, wouldn’t it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We do not expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
He will soon learn to swim.
What’s wrong with how I did it?
They know how to catch fish.
Tom walked out of the room.
I still do this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He received the first prize.
Tom is teaching French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She looked at him as he was swimming.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Do you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He is, so to speak, a human robot.
Answer the question!
You're needed at the hospital.
I can't find the lift.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I have no friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we are next.
I turned on the TV, there were broadcasts of the Grand Prix.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do that.
English is not my native language.
I didn’t have any friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's this girl's name?
We shouldn’t have let her go.
So you don't have to do it again.
They live there for ten years.
Tom nodded at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she is away.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why would Tom do that?
I know this girl’s father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I've scored 30 points.
If I don't, Tom will get angry.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Aren't you recording it?
A big tree fell on the road, and as I was driving, it blocked the way for me.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I live in Boston.
He was blind from birth.
I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren’t you starting to get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I am a student and he is not.
I was trying to do just that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sled.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko. She was born the same year as me, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you done your homework?
Monday is going to be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do people behave like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Fool.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I submitted the visa documents.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The rope broke as we went up the mountain.
Tom is driving.
If you ate fewer hamburgers, you’d probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary out.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how it is done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the shops are busy.
I haven’t made a decision yet.
What is today's date?
Where's Dad?
Shut the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple tree.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Uncle is your father's brother or mother's brother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
See you after the show.
I would like to ask a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This is my bag.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you in forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are those?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honshu and Kyushu.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have a lot of money in the bank.
I think we need to go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Relax. Relax.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compete with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We have equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's going to die?
Aren’t you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let’s sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become an object of criticism.
It will be genius.
I'm very scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
It's a lot worse.
I'm under the wing.
You didn't waste time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Will you not vote?
You should stop smoking.
I think Tom is cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play the violin?
Can you give me some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is unhappy.
It was popular among both students and teachers.
Tears of grief won't help.
Tom is playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
I'll see Tom later.
I know how to have a good time.
Did you know that Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the phone.
I'll be back soon.
The church is located at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell Tom to do it.
He speaks Esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom couldn't do it.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn’t like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a women's suitor.
I'll handle this.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Take off.
You're gonna let Tom move you?
You are a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Did Tom actually move to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
Speakers subconsciously follow the rules of their language, even without realizing them.
Tom is on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their guns at the elephant.
No one cares.
They tried.
Is Tom and Mary still here?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I would like to withdraw the money.
I shook Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
He is no longer a member of this club.
You don’t have to worry about tomorrow’s exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be right back.
Tom won't make Mary do it.
Tom started the thread.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom has lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend the holidays?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I’m still a little bored at home and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have trouble memorizing.
Where's Mom?
He died three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom is with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
That's very good!
You know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom is a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to get a taxi here?
Hurry, or you'll be late.
It will be difficult.
Does Tom always behave like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk that loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It will all work out, you will see.
She dumped him.
Tom is safe.
I finally got my driver’s license.
I'm not a student.
It was Mary’s fault.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom checks his phone all the time.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, but Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I've lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan to blow up the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
Eat somethin'.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Goodbye.
Please write your name in a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.
Tom goes to a party in the evening.
I told you.
She was headed to the airport.
She is currently studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's in there?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, then Esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we are going?
Tom doesn’t know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said exactly what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was kidding?
Tom was terribly bored.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be in the lab.
Please, wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take out the trash.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister is as beautiful as ever.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How horrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him for a job, you should consider his youth.
I’m sure it wasn’t a coincidence.
That's his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows that I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it will be impossible.
Do you have a headache?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom is falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He is always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
Tom is wearing a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French as a rule.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're useless.
Did you try to talk to them?
To do this was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me have a word with Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I don't think Tom can win.
Aliens arrive and take away our work. Earth for Earthlings! Let's deport Martians!
Don't worry about it.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can no longer go.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
Do you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
To do this was much harder than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I got better.
Are these people crazy?
Tom is curious.
Have you finished the job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It is not difficult to do.
Tom's dead.
I like to be alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but I'm taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I have never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would be there.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You seemed to be interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don’t really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I knew what my mistake was.
I like to travel.
The phone is not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in his sunglasses.
Tom paints well.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a costume for Halloween?
Tom is busy and can't help you right now.
We're not the money.
A student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I’m starting to get a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Does Tom really think that someone is listening?
There is no need for betrayal!
Tom, you might say, is good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to leave earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How to say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Couldn't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I've been playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an unbearable person.
What's going on here?
Tom said that you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, it's free.
I am very interested in learning French.
Good for the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your work.
Are you working somewhere nearby?
You admit that, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm dirty.
You are always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You are very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it again.
I share with everyone.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom ever talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
She's been canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom is okay.
I don't sleep well.
Won't you buy it?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
You did this?
I have trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
I'm pretty good at dancing.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It is obvious that you will be cheaper to spend the night with us.
He doesn’t watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare prick.
His hair was getting thinner and thinner.
Yesterday, my sister went to Kobe.
Don’t you speak from an experience point of view?
He likes ice cream.
I was hungry.
What do you need to know?
She has twice as many CDs as I do.
The street is empty again.
Tom couldn't catch the rabbit.
All dogs are faithful.
I think Tom hates me.
We are so happy.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
Aren't you staying with us?

I'm tired of playing.
Are you French or English?
He came back for the horn.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
You've made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are exceptions.
Did Tom say when he'd come?

Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He resigned at the age of 65.
I lost my pen.
