There are a number of Members of Parliament who are concerned about a proposal to change their title to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created because of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the political spectrum are concerned about exposing themselves to ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party was concerned that it would rhyme with TWP and PWP.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means dom and pwp kaka.
A member of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was disbanded over the name change, but indicated that MWP and Muppet would not be far from each other.
In this context, the Welsh bust "w" is pronounced the same as the bust "u" in Yorkshire English.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to initiate the name change, said: "The proper decision on the appointment of the deputies is, of course, with the deputies themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 Wales Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received a lot of support.
The commission favored "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs," but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the title of the deputies.
MEPs appear to be proposing other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may cause headaches for the upcoming official, Elin Jones, who is expected to sign the bill on the changes within two weeks.
The legislation on the reform includes other amendments, such as how the Assembly works, as well as rules on the disqualification of deputies and the design of the committee system.
Members are given the last word on the question, as they should be called, when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians have a lot for the referendum on the name of the country.
The election will be held on Sunday to decide whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a proposal to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, which is called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour was a cry on its territory and has repeatedly voted against its bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the name change, said he did not want to recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that the change of the name is the price to be paid to advise the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are as quiet as the churches during the Harlem Battle
"In the past, the old people said that there was a cafe in every corner and a church," said Lord Adams.
"There's nothing left today."
He said that the coffee's taste was good.
“People are socializing today,” he said.
"They don't want to go to a restaurant where people are going to eat regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the value of the sale of assets will not last as long as those responsible imagine, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with properties and filled with people who do not help the remaining protection areas in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to close these churches quickly, because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built of white communities, before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community was relocated in the 1930s.
A black community of not far away took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main street for trading in Harlem that no blacks wanted to appoint.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's community made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's brother and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the game "The Bell of the Poor."
The expert, who played the chess game in July, called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the largest clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Lord Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has taken place in St. Martin in the last month has been a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some introduced by the lay faithful, others by the bishoprics.
In July, the Sacristy - the leading body, with lay responsibilities - wrote down the dioceses, with the concern that the dioceses "would ensure that the costs were passed on to the Sacristy", although the Sacristy was not included in the ministry of the architects.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency of the diocese's pages.
Hai injured 13-year-old in lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was showered with lobsters in California, and injured him on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack happened shortly before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour on a Saturday since he heard the boy call for help and was paddling up with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
The lobster said he thought at first it was just the joy of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he "was kissed!"
I have been devastated!"
"His whole body was shattered," he said as he reached the door.
"I told everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" he added.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical care.
The nature of the shark that attacked is unknown.
SpongeCapt. Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victims were suffering from traumatic injuries to the worker.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for remedial and security purposes.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s is a British beauty market that has grown up in the United Kingdom.
Sainsbury's takes on boots, superdrugs and Debenhams, with kafhaus-style beauty departments with specialized assistants.
As part of a substantial announcement in the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which keeps on knowing as the fashion and household goods return, these larger beauty departments will have 11 stores across the country, and next year and beyond.
Supermarkets invest in beauty because they want to fill the shelves that were otherwise reserved for the shelves, microwaves, and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said they would be the size of its beauty offerings up to 3,000 products including for the first time with brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, which are already available, will also get more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boat shops.
The supermarket is also launching its boutique make-up range again, so the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Purchasing online and buying small amounts of everyday foods and small businesses means that the supermarkets will have to make more efforts to get people to buy them.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets would look more and more like department store stores, as the supermarket chain tried to fight more services and non-food products against discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' has opened Argos oulets and hundreds of aftermarket stores as well as some Habitats stores since the supermarket bought both chain two years ago. This has boosted the sale of foodstuffs and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's recent attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmacies department has failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the cooperation was quickly overdue after a dispute over portions of the revenues from the drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 drugs to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Llodys is set to play a role in the plan by launching an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that sets the old ways of shopping and shooting."
Peter Jones "slowly" about a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has become "slow" after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a contract worth over <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with their lifestyle branding business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
The moderator of This Morning, 37, announced on her Instagram account that she is going.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, out of her lucrative lifetsyle brand business last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "slow" as the TV star during a sprawling meeting in Dundee at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contract - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million for Truly - meant her home access was no longer a threat.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly, Holly was by far his top priority.
It would have been her long-term future, which she would accompany through the next century.
His decision to leave the country surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what had happened in the past, it was so close to the beginning.
In Marlow's headquarters, there is a warehouse with goods that are ready for sale.
Experts believe that the abandonment of the This-Morning moderator, who is one of the bankable stars from the UK, could cost the company millions, as they invest a lot in products, from pillows and candles to clothes to homewear, and it is now potentially rescheduled for launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were married to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the bee with the 2016 Capp, and Jones, 52, resigned as president in March.
The couple are together and the vacation in Jones is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as moderator of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night "We won't comment on his business."
It's hard to talk, and then we fall in love.
He made the joke about the criticism he would get from the media because of a comment that some people would consider "non-presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Today, the Trump in his play "Television Moderator's Voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump's first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization are not forthcoming.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leading politician during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had no "responsive response" from the U.S. to the former disarmament steps taken by North Korea.
The U.S. will continue to impose sanctions in order to continue to do so.
Trump was much more optimistic about his position.
"I'm good with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – no more missile tests, help to liberate hostages and the repatriation of American soldiers who fell in battle to stop deadly terrorist missile tests.
And he defended his unusual manner and manner as he spoke about the relations with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have only 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the people directly in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, hundreds of people died.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been delocalized, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalysis of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have done very thoroughly that they do not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to work on foreign staff on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman of the national disaster protection administration, said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation too palu, to see if international agencies can participate in the aid measure.
With regard to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, unfortunately, the country is not sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Even though tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they don't exist anywhere on the coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though there was a warning, may have cost many lives.
Travelling between the different Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure the main topic of his election campaign and donated money for the streets and the railways.
However, Mr. Yoko's reign was also plotted by a lack of funding, where he set up again next year.
Mr. Joko is also exposed to pressure from partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bells and arrows and other brutal weapons on the street.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool compares the match with a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a goal in the 89th minute a Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal and his team were tied 1-0.
He shot the ball with his left foot and in the direction of the goal.
The attempt has flown high over the box, and in the direction of the right corner of the net.
The ball is flown over a jumping arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"Just going around to get in this position, getting the ball and playing games like Shaq always play as much as possible before, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edges come and touched it once, and didn't think about it and just shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break for a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blues starrer made a pass back to the Mateo Kovacic in this game, before rushing towards Liverpool halfway.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the middle field.
He then shot a beautiful ball through the floor, which sent Hazard into the box.
Hazard runs along the defense and ends up at the long pot with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on a Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 a.m. and Donneschden in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the agency's spokesman, Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings, which were destroyed by the earthquake of a strength of 7.5 a friday, and triggered the wave of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.

The Cromwell statue of Parliament will be the new memorial in the series "Writing History."
His exile was a poetic justification for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatical and puritanical adherents of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Lord Crick's suggestion as "unreasonable" and "attempting to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the discussion of the statue's obituary, it was inevitable that the figure on Oliver Cromwell was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The symbolism of the English Civil War was ordered by Cromwell and also not executed.
Perhaps the false Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroftseng's grand representation of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of being celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "The Cromwell has been regarded by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it's an accurate representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His performances as Lord Protector are worthy of being celebrated and remembered.
The farmer's pigs
Local media reported that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery near a stable at a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, for an injection of vaccines for pigs in a farm.
According to reports, he was traveling with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby swiss stall.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the snow.
A forensic medical investigation has confirmed that the date 550 pounds of heavy swine slaughtered the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and swollen," as the cousin nicknamed "Wu," as the Guiyang Evening News quotes.
Surveillance cameras show Yuan Donneschdes Moies going to the market at 4:40 am to feed the pigs.
His body was swollen an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
According to reports, the Yuan is presumably negotiating with his family and the authorities of the market over decisions for his death.
However, even in the case of humans, there have been reports of cases in which pigs have been attacked.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their yard in Massachusetts. The man was severely injured.
In 2006, a 650-pound swine weighed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to leave the farm.
After a farmer in Oregon was frozen in 2012 by his pig, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as an "extractor."
They're just gamers.
It's just that they don't want to hurt you, they don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens off, as it moves over the deadly waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, the Pink Floods will bring flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
The rose had a wall impact of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will shine a sun in the north.
Meanwhile, a canal is constantly forming over the Pacific Ocean, and drifts towards the west coast of the United States, and the Rose may be closer and closer to the Baja California peninsula than the tropical squid, it will begin deep tropical humidity from the north to the southwest.
The rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity, which interacts with the more nearby channel, will form widely distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous flooding, mudslides, and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity causes winds of 2 to 3 inches per hour in various locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 centimeters of rain are expected in parts in the southwest, especially much over Arizona.
Flooding is possible, with weather conditions that are increasingly worsening due to the destructive nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely light-hearted to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical cliffs.
Thick rows can cause canyons that quickly become flooded and thunderstorms will bring local rough air and dust with them.
The more approaching canal will bring déke local line to the parts of the southern California coast.
Locks of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mudflats and smooth roads.
This would be the first time in the season's history.
Some distributed tropical rainforests begin to come closer to Arizona, in the late sun and early months, before the ree continues to be distributed, in the late months and densities.
The rain will be distributed in the four corners of the dens and a Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Heiansdo leads this to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a probe in the center of the United States.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build and expand.
In many central and eastern United States, a warm start in October is expected with widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast gives high chances of over-average temperatures for the east of the United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have seen a thunderstorm that gripped Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, which was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political squabble continues, and broadcasters have disrupted the regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a freeman: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake signed with the FBI to make retaliation during a week of the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was fully committed to her and tried to execute her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic manner, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the trial.
The company has calculated an average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that transmitted the process, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network were not directly available.
And Nielsen often has a few difficulties associating people who look into offices.
To illustrate the whole: the number of spectators corresponds to that of a playoff football match or the Oscar overtaking.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the trial over the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, such as Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of freedom.
After the moderate Republican office issued a position that it would elect Kavanaugh, he was given a free hand by demonstrators while trying to get a lift for a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with gazing at his eyes while he was shot and was live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have power, but so many women have no power."
Flake announced that his office would have taken a position and, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
The cable and broadcast networks have all been reporting live for hours as the Judiciary Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI is investigating the lawsuits against the nominees for next week, which the Democrats wanted the minority to do.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations with his friend, the Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the mediation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the UK's future and weaken national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, in addition to her on the headline of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, underscored his attack on their so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU "should lay their taxes on each other."
Wayde-Sims shooting: The police have arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons and police said the Sims lost their glasses in the fight.
Police found the spectacle at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA after it, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After the Simpsons were heard, the police said that he had admitted to shooting the Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the affidavit reported.
The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner has released a Friday a provisional report, which says the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is tasked by the Louisiana State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and residents of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flush and search for justice."
The Sims were 20 years old.
The 2.01 metre tall boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
A Friday Moien told the LSU basketball coach that his team was "destroyed" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano spreads ash on Mexico City
Scattered ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighbors of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Relief warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in the last 24 hours.
The center has a number of towers and towers.
Images on social networks show thin layers of ash on the cars and neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed a sonam of volcanic activity that shook 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing election for the separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists were held back in revolt against the police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day and the police took out their ties to control the fighters.
Over a few hours, pro-independence group called "Don't Forget, Don't Forgive" against unionists who called "Long Live Spain."
Fourteen people have been hospitalized after being injured in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose to be independent, but the result was low against the separation by boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people have been injured last year after the Pole tried to stop the election in the constituencies due to the region's violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped outside at night to prevent a demonstration on the backing of the national police force.
The demonstration continued, but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, says he no longer has any hope for the prospect of an independent Catalonia.
Last year, we had one of our best moments.
"I saw my parents screaming for joy, because they could go a lot, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections in December last year, it was difficult for the Catalan independence parties to remain in swing this year. Most of the most well-known leaders were in exile or in prison and have gone on to play their part in organizing the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who picked up the protests on the phone as support for the police, said the conflict was heated by politicians from both sides.
"It's going to be more and more exciting," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the preventive prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will participate in the European elections next year.
"As a candidate to stand for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression and democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Runs Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent and Donneschde at 19:30 BST.
Insp. Bob Blemmings said there is damage to the pair and to the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point a gunshot was fired at the car.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers through Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Promoted Livingston summons the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second win and 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remains without any extra wins in the Premiership this season and plays against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Earlier, the Rangers Rapid Vienna in the Europa League received a donneschden.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends their run in the division to six players, with coach Holt still winning the game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses the chances against open visitors.
The team was supposed to have the nuts for Holt long before the hit, because their directness caused the Ranger problems.
Scott Robinson got through but carried his effort to the front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort ahead and hit Craig Halkett in front of the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery among the visitors.
That's how the decision was made.
The Rangers were given a free kick in Livingston standing, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play the menga, which was once touched and struck from the center of the box.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession but found the home defense inpenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied the feet of Rangers Golkipp Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide from after a game of Livingston.
Crusaders always came into Livingston's box and were always cleared, while two eleven-meters were required - after the necklace challenged Glenn Middleton's replacement, and one for handball - were dropped.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this high road.
Their style of play and staff has hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but big credit must go to the hole for the way he has experienced the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was led by a huge, super-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
The Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass fell – only as they measured the home side – and it is something like an awakening for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an will receive a special reception in Cologne.
There was laughter in the blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the chiefs of Turkey and Germany saw themselves drinking coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was planned to improve relations between the NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, press freedom in Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have taken security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from their gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have stepped up to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents - many of them Kurdish - have also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both protests reflect the divisions of a visitor who is welcomed as a hero by various German Turks and as a monarch by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in a collision with a car.
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescuers helped, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred months after a cyclist died in a driver's flight on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Blessed in Unrest
Six suspects have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison officer said.
The storm erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. on a Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were brought in to take care of the ordeal, which involved eight prisoners in a flick.
Officers were placed on the spot for small wounds in the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for blessings.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the responsibility of the police can be denied and spent longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison in the clinic was treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, offensive officers were summoned to prison to deal with a serious disorder in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It's rare to encounter a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa sings last energy down through the southwestern desert trembles and brings flood risks.
The national resurgence has already triggered flooding for months and densities four-way to western Arizona heading south into eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route over Phoenix Density and come closer months later with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have been able to maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 centimetres of rain, with isolated inches up to 6 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin may receive 1 to 2 centimeters, with isolated inches up to 4 centimeters.
For those without flooding risks, Rosa's rain is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although the flooding is a very serious concern, a little of the rain will probably be good because in the southwest are currently dry conditions.
The United States after just over 40 percent of Arizona experienced at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is on its way to Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force a Sunday morning with a maximum wall speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and rebounds north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit more deadly waters in the Pacific and lost strength as a result.
So, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoons or evenings.
Rain over parts of Mexico could be difficult, posing a significant flood risk.
"Crashes of 3 to 6 centimetres are expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 centimetres possible," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border and early morning Germany as a tropical depression, where it then rises through Arizona and southern Utah later in the afternoon.
The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the United States' southwestern desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudslides in the desert, and earthquakes in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton's four suspects have been arrested.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged murder after a 16-year-old man was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The youth is found injured in the area of the Excelsior terraces in Midsomer Norton, around 4am a Saturday.
And when he was brought to the hospital, his health condition would be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset shot.
Police have called for witnesses who may have picked up something with their cell phones to report it.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the anger of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and aggravating tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered through all of the recklessness and anxiety of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally refuted Christine Blasey Ford's statement before Congress that he should have sexually assaulted them as they were teenagers.
Ford has also said it's going to work.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people have seen the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of dead for the public.
The president never referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump has argued that he is on a mission as "to be and to brake."
The first decisive Senate-level election for Kavanaugh's nomination is set to take place on Friday, a senior co-worker told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many have swam away as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people took part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu in the open as 6-metre-high waves struck in half-dark across the coast, causing many to die and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still going to the beach for their activities and were not immediately left," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster protection, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was full of cars, huts, heathers, it took everything to land with it," said the Nugroho, specifying that the tsunami at sea speeds of 800 km/h before hitting one on the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial footage that was made public by disaster protection showed many buildings and buttresses that were destroyed, bridges that were torn apart and collapsed, and a mosque that surrounded the entirety of the water as well.
The savages were still on the coast.
Earthquakes have been reported in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology said in a communiqué that the energy you were released during the earthquake had the power of 200 times the atomic bomb you fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical situation of the city at the end of a long-close bay may have further strengthened the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, warehouses, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Bodies were found among the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 wounded and 29 missing.
The Nugroho says that the injuries and damage could be major to me on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in an area called Doggola and dated me near the epicenter.
The communication "as completely combined and we are without information" of Dongglola, says the Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on the move in the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency as well as Samsden are strongly criticized because they only shot that it had hit Tsunami Palu, officials said the waves came out at the same time as the warning.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher pile who warns you by calling you on the street below before the tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, and erects buildings and cars mats.
Reuters was only able to confirm the bills.
The floods and tsunami caused a massive power outage, and communication around Palu was hampered, with authorities having difficulty coordinating rescue efforts.
The army sent first transport planes with aid lines from Jakarta and other cities, so the authorities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and things for the most important needs.
The local airport was only opened for rescue teams and will remain tracked until October.
President Joko Widodo has been asked to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It's as bad as it is.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola are sure to arrive in Palu City as, where the employees and tent time are underway on the grounds of this office, their scenes of destruction had to be revealed, according to Lord Doseba.
"They told me that they had a lot of broken homes," he said.
It's as bad as it is.
Just as the aid teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, several have complained that foreign aid teams, with extensive experience, were only allowed to cross the area on Palu.
According to Indonesian law, material and personnel are allowed to enter the country only when the affected area is declared as a national disaster area.
But it's still just happening.
"It's still a regional disaster," says Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, it's like a national disaster,' we can open up for international help, but the dates are more than just happening."
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of its freedoms, friends and families hope that here missing out on those miracles will always come after such disasters.
It's like a canal out of a canal.
A rescuer rescued a woman who was buried under a pile of rubble, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has had two of the missing paragliders shot for the Asian players,
Some of the students from the Roa Roa Hotel were students, according to the Lord Monday.
"When I was on the parade, I was carrying my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon was just like him, and in the hours after the news where the rumour of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the Paragliding Group went around, WhatsApp sent messages to the teams that participated in the Beach Festival.
Sadly, it's only a one-year-old, and it's only two-year-old.
"I think it's just a matter of time," he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while filling a vending machine in Newport/Levee.
The raiders had a free demolition of a Brink's security guard who had gone in to fill a cash machine, stolen $26,750 in Newport/Levee, according to a letter from the Newport Police.
The chauffeur was in the process of emptying the cash register in a recovery complex and was supposed to fill the money, according to police officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole his money case that was supposed to be delivered.
There were more suspects in the case, but the police did not know how many of them were missing.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Twitter, he tweeted: "It's officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, as Ye had been called for some time and had used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The album will be released on Saturday Night Live, where the release of the new album will be announced.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande di for "emotional reasons" only in the show, according to the show's founder.
Although there is an abbreviation for his professional name, the West has previously said that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' as the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," the West told me earlier this year, at a performance of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours.
It comes from Kanye, daat means the only one, to ye - a mirror of our good, our evil, our perseverance, everything.
"The album is a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs once called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he decided to make love and brother love.
A former West's Matt singer, Jay-Z, has also always played with small- and big-songs.
Mexico and the United States have vowed to take military action against civilians.
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody end of the war against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to attack the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to intimidate the Mexican people."
During a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops fired at the people and killed 300 at a time when they were going left-right back through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced that young Mexicans will be supported by monthly grants and students and by the opening of more free universities.
He has said that he believes that the violence and abuses of children's rights are a threat to the rights of children.
The U.S. would have doubled the funding of the K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its share of research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come as more and more from U.S. government circles hear that the U.S. doesn't have the right strategy in researching AI.
As China has outlined its last year's plan, the first in AI's research will be by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, if one considers that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next jump being measured in the U.S., Lee CNN said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the best-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that had beaten the highest-ranking American Othello player, later he was Director General at Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee knew of the leading technology competitions in the U.S. such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and have asked when the next would be to help find the next visionaries.
The U.S. government has often had to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
"It's not just China that gets the top academics; it's the societies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have engaged the luminaries and past years of universities to work on AI.
As a result, the U.S. government's immigration laws have also been improved in the U.S.
"I think the green card is automatically measured by the professors in the AI, he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations are doing for US researchers, but the quality of academic work as in China is only as good, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year in the U.S., the Secretary of Defense established a joint AI center, which is to bring together partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative called Safe AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million in AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government is set to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in the past few months.
Macedonia has decided to hold a referendum on the name of the country.
The people of Macedonia have in a referendum on whether to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a scramble for its initial dispute with Greece that prevents accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claimed that the name of Noopeskland was an attempt to secure the province and filed its veto against its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal on the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the exchange undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has shown that it is difficult to reach the required 50 percent for the elections to be valid.
The referendum's request reads: "You are for a NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the prize would be paid for admission to organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to prepare for the future of Macedonia so that young people can live freely under the predicament of the European Union because it means a more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although only legally incumbent, enough parliamentarians have shot that they would be happy to get the result of the vote.
For the name change, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
As a result, the state election commission would not be able to report any irregularities in the elections until 13 o'clock.
Nevertheless, the turnout was at only 16 percent, against the 2016 parliamentary elections where 66 percent of eligible voters had been elected.
"I'm coming here to welcome my children, our place as in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, ë Wiehler in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko announced in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to the road to NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, staged a small and silent protest in front of the tents of those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head high, only through the animals" Soot Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they only want us as Macedonia, we can turn to each other as China and Russia enter into part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring our significant investment to Macedonia, which has had its chomagetaux of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority is therefore more than 80 percent of the population for NATO and the EU," Zaev said after leaving the election booth.
He said that the "yes" result would be "confirmation for our future."
A survey by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - less than required.
Another representative, from the Macedonian television station Telma TV, noted that 57 percent of the respondents planned to go ahead on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent are soothing.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50 percent plus one vote is required.
It would be the first major election to take place in the campaign of the pro-Western government.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the entire defence of Brighton and makes a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling break through ‘Defense from Brighton to Manchester City and win 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero dropped the ball lightly in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker got a pass in the middle field at the start of the race.
He was the first of three defenders of Brighton, and he hated his open field.
Aguero is a four-pointer.
He's been shoved into the back of a shoe, and he's been shoved into the back of a shoe.
Then he went to the place where the squirrels had taken the squirrel.
The English as the mat the first ball touching the field neared before and had the Aguero back who with the right foot to the goalkeeper of Brighton sat the ball in the right corner.
"The Aquero currently has minor problems in the feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We had to wait for him to play for 55, 60 minutes.
as if it happened.
We're happy that he scored the goal at the time."
But it was the sterling that hated the Sky Blues' initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aquero hits the ball far in the middle of Brighton.
He had a wonderful pass over the left flank at Leroy Sane.
It's a bit of a snag, and the snags are a long way from the snags.
The Sky Blues just shot the ball and the net would have gone out.

The jokes about the game against the rockies
With the elimination of the nationals in the playoffs, as a reason there to find a new start.
But the ever-defying joker hopes to take over against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still struggled to secure their title in the first division.
"But if we don't play for anything, at least we can do a great game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team who will probably play at the highest level that I will experience this year.
Why shouldn't I stand up for him?"
The Nationals still have to communicate how to start a Sunday, but are certainly well advised to let the jokes in that situation pitch.
The joker, who will play his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will play a Sunday on his break day.
The men of Washington as 18-7 have a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 live this season.
Trump on his way to West Virginia
The president pointed to the situation around his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the upper house while pointing to the importance of a victory of the Republicans in these midterm elections.
"Everything I've done is in November.
Five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great — I'm just running but I'm really running so I'm fighting for a good candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these formidable, formidable radical groups of democrats, you see what's happening now.
And those who are determined to take power under all circumstances, you see the senselessness, the communion.
"Those who don't care who hurt them, who have to convince them to get their power and control, given that it's what they want, the power and control, we can't give them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you've seen Dad in the last four days," he said, referring to Democrats as "riseless and meaningless and boneless and lost."
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee by the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was most frequently exploited.
"Are you going to respond here?"
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, waat.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Work is no longer God's work.
It's intolerant of those who think they are.
When I was in the middle of the election campaign, I was a little surprised.
In the end, I'm the last one to get kicked out of a working party that we would only welcome - just because we say what we think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan is treated as similar because she is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, when the censorship criticized me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt views the importance of a responsible entry into the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically similar events in which Jeremy has been criticized by leading leaders.
The note for Nottingham East Workers' Meeting on Friday says that "we want our meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a local worker's representative, the Friday evening meeting was exactly the right time.
Today, unfortunately, as dat only more the tone at many meetings and the promises of "my friendly, my fine" politics than ever since long time ago, has been so.
It is increasingly striking that other opinions are only tolerated in the working party and any opinion is held to be acceptable as for the party meeting.
This was shortly after Jeremy took over the leadership, as colleagues with whom I had previously argued had experienced similar political biases on the part of me that I would have taken the position I would have never taken in the EU - in the national sense as well.
Every time I have spoken publicly - and it's not really important I say - I then get a tidal wave of comments on social media against the politics of the middle, and which we say I would only have my place in the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
However, I know that I'm better off than some of my colleagues because the comments I get are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleges who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and don't look away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is how the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour Party to maintain a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer from God and with every "non-confidence" movement or change of selection rules the party becomes ever smaller.
In the last two years, I've been getting a lot of rattlesnakes to keep me calm, not being too hard, and then I'd be "in the king."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, engrossed by a reluctance of the Thatcher government during which my classroom almost coincided, I have tried to improve the public services as a policy for those who need it most.
I've never hid my politics, not even in the last few elections.
No one in Nottingham East was able to doubt my political position and the points at which I do not agree with the current leadership.
For those of you who like the free movement, all I want to say is if the country is facing a Brexit, that's pushing the government, trade and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my drive to work.
But the only message I have concerns the Nottingham momentum, it is for my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that no drones or political excuses will stop me from doing what I believe is what I believe in.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr not beaten up
Two tries in the last time have screwed up the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now in the spotlight, the only one unbeaten of 10.
In the end, it was a better defense, just like the better grabs of chances that the home team and coach Peter Murchie were able to enjoy.
"We've been in our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they took the chance better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, accompanied by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr afterward, but a yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, which he received in a game of the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unchanged attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr, just before half-time, he then converted a single attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, reversed by Baggot, was able to reduce the difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was injured, in a fresh start, Ayr was able to restart through a run by Stafford McDowall, replaced by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, as always, and as Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he shoved the Climo without a ball on the string line, Macpherson was able to catch a touchdown in the back of the grabbing Ayr.
Climo was able to transform, as he did from the start, after Kyle Rowe was able to start David Armstrong's kickoff and assist flanker Gregor Henry in his fifth run.
Stars are looking for a new career in the hotel industry
The star actor Ford Kieran is looking to change into a hotelier, after discovering that he has been nominated director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the well-known BBC show, which he writes and in which he plays as a co-star with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next 9 episodes will be the last of the show, and Kiernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is a director at Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor leaves all commentary on the story, although a source from the "Scottish Sun" has revealed that the key has gone in, to come to "the thriving restoration industry" of Glasgow.
The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that justice will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Matroos are patrolling under Taquelage in the headquarters of La Paz.
The buildings were decorated with an ocean-blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon run under the motto: "The sea belongs to us rightly.
It's our duty to take it back."
Throughout the whole of Bolivia, the memory of a 19th-century conflict in Chile's lost coast is still alive - the will to sail back out to the Pacific Ocean.
Now, the hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the drive, the spirit of harmony and trust, and of course hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are pursuing the International Court of Justice’s decision on big screens in the hope that the Hague will be adjudicated by Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic talks – Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia on a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is planning a controversial fight for re-election next year – relies heavily on Monday's talks.
"We're going back to the Pacific shortly before," he said in late August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the court will not be able to decide on Bolivia's accession - and that there would not be much change if it were to do so.
The U.N. agency, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has not reported any violence against Chile and has announced that it is not interfering in any talks.
That the court's decision is already being discussed 6 months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead, the Bolivian oil industry, which has been declining for the last four years, has been declining.
"The question of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's combative rhetoric has weakened all Chilean will, to be precise.
Bolivia and Chile continue to talk at some point, but it is then extremely difficult to predict the talks after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, as Bolivian representative in The Hague, said the court's decision was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia offered "an exceptional opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to a 139-year-old dispute with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the maritime exit as a political springboard.
"Bolivia never ceases to grant its right to access to the Pacific," he said.
"It's an opportunity to try to let go of our past behind us."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen before it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke in front of the U.N. General Assembly.
He appealed to the U.S. to stick to its promises, which were given to the president by rivals at a summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to reconcile nuclear negotiations with North Korean Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore's diplomatic break-up.
Ri said it was "a dream" that further sanctions in the U.S.'s address against a declaration for the Korean War would ever touch Korea and kneel.
Washington is cautious, agreeing to the declaration, without Pyongyang taking the first step in the direction of massive disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang believes it is with the disarmament of an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Parisian fashion shows a massive rise of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil on the Catwalk a bunch of oversized headgear for their SS19 collection, putting the style on the Paris Fashion Weeks and shooting.
Absolutely impractical heat flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather and the model's head flooded.
Other oversized accessories with ornamental watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne has also released a few comedic masks – just right for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have added lipstick and are more similar to the Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkeling and glasses, while the other looks like a melted icecornet.
And if you want to see more, then you will not be disappointed.
It's important to note that you can find a huge amount of space on your way to the store.
The oversized heat strongly resembles the feud of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide board, which one has already seen at Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the intensely impractical heat that has flooded social media sends yet another great creation to the catwalk – a sand beach body as big as the model who presents it.
The deep orange bass corset, with bass frets and a white song handle, was the main focus in Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection on the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Star stylist Luke Armitage said: "I expect to see big heat and beach body on our streets next summer - because designers have achieved such a big impact, it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are indispensable for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic performance and this has continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which can only be strengthened by individual and collective performances in sports, arts, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a school with a well-developed and discussed curriculum, I see modern languages as popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these exams, we can see that languages are at the top, with the best results within the independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who have studied foreign languages have graduated with an A+.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students had an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people need unequivocally in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered the same as major subjects (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also differently.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission on Vocations and Skills found that employers indicated that it is difficult to fill vacancies, 17% due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming increasingly important for preparing young people for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities, which require languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a global world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, when one has learned a second language, one has a real lead in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in England, 75 percent are not good enough to speak a foreign language to conduct a conversation, with French as the only language remaining 15 percent in the bilingual area.
That's why it's so important to invest in language learning in today's children.
As a result of the growth of the economy, children have a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, all schools offer different languages.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while learning other languages that could be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there is always a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be disputed in a global business environment that languages are vital for the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer this whale, diversity and superior performance for the young people of Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is a member of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on a Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans, who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakers has announced that James is playing a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
You just have to decide how many minutes it's going to take.
"They're more like one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As a winner, James was asked earlier this week how his plans for the Lakers' six-player pre-season program are.
"I don't need a pre-season player at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's Wal-Mart tour of West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a bright cloud of whaling events campaigns.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him accommodating sunny spots such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation votes in favor of his election for the post of the top judge, Trump is waiving support for the upcoming mid-term elections, since Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia election event tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's whaling event for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, 7 p.m. ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia election event online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would be taking this week's inauguration for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been on trial for a week for alleged sexual abuse with a former senator, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help Republicans face the elections in November and get a fresh start.
So, President Trump's campaign told the five events next week that the goal is to "give new energy to volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the most important time of the campaign," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event could bring the evening supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be treated by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday was the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senatorial candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is returning to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him gain momentum in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 The U.S. team demonstrates courage for the fight to keep the hopes for the singles fight alive on Sunday
After three separate sessions, the four-day fight may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing swing pendulum is a very invented sports concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more like in competitions like this.
Where are you going to tell me that it's swank?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's the other four, so we see that now as a small swing," said Jordan Spieth, as he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points ahead with twelve more to play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, have a little wall in their sails and they have a lot to be mounted, not to mention the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and they both end up with three out of four points.
The spieth was deadly from tea to green and is an example.
The cheering keelgejait became harder as his round progressed, a major pit sank to tear the match apart and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His putt, through which they won the match at 15, was left with a similar circle, of that kind, a sort that he believes the American team is not out there.
"You just have to be careful and take care of your own game," he said.
That's all that's left of this game.
18 points to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but beloved couple four out of four before and can't do anything wrong anymore.
"Moliwood" was the only band that did not shoot a samsung Bogey on Saturday night, but who also avoided the samsung walls, Friday night and the nine back a samsung Bogey.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow with and from the viewers, cements that they are the players who deserve to be beaten on a Sunday, and there will be no more favorite players to defeat a potential European victory, when the sun rises above the Le Golf National.
Most of the time, the two at the same time on different holes.
However, it's still a matter of time before a European victory is announced.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of Moien in Fourball, as a band with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the first nine buried the spuns and the swedes in a laugh, from which they could not get out so quickly.
There's no one out there to help you laugh.
The four-ball and four-player are due to the interactions between the team formations; the voice that they are given; the voice that they are not given in the way a strategy in a vision can change, so fascinating to look at.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is going well and leading for the last day, but this four-player session has also shown that the U.S. team has the will to fight what has been doubted, especially the Statesside.
Europe will go 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe has a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after four balls from a Saturday in the four match against the USA with 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two wins over a fluctuating Tiger Woods to take their lead on four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a poorly run American side in the quarter-finals, the series sitting 3-1.
The United States offers more resistance in the four, winning two matches, but they do not get the deficit lifted.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points of 12 individual matches and a sundae to get the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row while in the Molinari, along with "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend just the second time being the four points since the first four games in Ryders Cup history.
Against the Woods and Patrick Reed won the four-ball match, they harmonized well against an empty Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
The Woods, who played himself through two matches on Saturday, showed heiansdo brilliant outbursts in the four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, paused in this four-legged moiety, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the fours and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third-placed in the world - with 2&1.
Europe doesn't just hate it on a beautiful, sunny day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the time for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They picked up a massive 2&1 victory over spawners Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarterback and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team had a come back from a four-point deficit for in the singles, although Furyk's side only needed to help him get the trophy.
After they were second best for two days, as always, a counterattack on Sunday seemed like not wanted by them.
North Korea Says ‘No Case’ They Would Have Disappeared Without Trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions would discredit the U.S. and there would be no way for North Korea to unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting that North Korea showed a lot of "good will" in the past year, as the stops of nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning of the nuclear test site, and the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology did not increase further.
"However, we do not see an equal response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri is rewarded with the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for resisting the single step, he emphasizes his outburst in which he does not explicitly deny a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri is referring to a joint letter from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit testing an acting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea faced a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States soon had to abandon Pyongyang's nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the 'denuclearization-first' and raises pressure through sanctions to enforce in a coercive manner, and raises objections to the 'declaration of the end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that the sanctions could get us on our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are averting our mistrust."
Ri did not say anything of plans for a second summit test against Kim and Trump, who was a U.S. leader only the week before the United Nations met.
The minister, however, met three times to test Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and said: "If the party for denuclearization of South Korea were and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a thing."
Gradually, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of last year, as a shot in front of the UN General Assembly that targets on the US mainland were triggered by North Korean missiles by the "Lord Devil President" Trump as he called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide note.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, blamed Kim for his courage to take the first steps to disarmament, but said that much work must remain from North Korea to best sanctions.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timetable for it, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it's not important."
China and Russia have vowed to reward Pyongyang's UN Security Council for its progress.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be monitored and in any case passed until we have achieved a complete, final and proven de-nuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has intensified initial sanctions against North Korea, in the hopes that they could deter Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program by firing funds.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly and said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said that Prog<0xC3><0xA8>s had been moderated, but within hours, North Korea denounced him for his "gangster demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex, the Americans should take "demonstrating measures."
He said Kim would like to use "demonstrating measures" to look for security guarantees that Trump has assured in Singapore and rapprochement with normal relations with Washington.
There are many college students who are willing to take a lot of classes.
A new course at Harvard University allows all of its students to get more sleep and thus try to combat the growing macho culture, in which one spends the night with coffee in the blood.
One academic has found that students of the university, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, has assembled the court, which is for him the first in the area in America.
He was inspired by the court's inception, after giving a four-pronged resolution on the impact of lack of sleep on the teachings.
"At the end of the fourth year, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I the first to do this, in my last year?'"
He said that so far no one has told him anything about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The Court, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep can help academic and sporting performance, as well as how a general well-being can bring with it.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business executive of the university's health services, said the university had decided to offer the court, after noting that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The court, which lasts an hour, offers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of a dormitory is shown, where students can click on cafes, rides, sports tracks and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lute, but also how athletic performance of sleep is affected and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, those involved learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have a right to know this – just as one has a right to know what causes health problems to the bodies of cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of self-breathing that has been taught all night, still exists, so the professors, and the modern technology and pressure on the students, which is becoming ever greater, has resulted in lack of sleep and is a problem that is becoming ever greater.
He said that insuring enough quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, overwhelm and fear - even to prevent one from helping, wanting to put the brain into hunger snot and one has the feeling of always being hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the court, even after choosing one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to offer the court to the whole university.
He hopes, in a next step, to bring all PhD students to complete a similar degree program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when they should go to bed, but also to get up, and watch out for harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights and which can cause problems with the rhythm distributed throughout the day.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hits Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered a further defeat due to Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's little related side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side tried to secure their first game since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard his second defeat and 18 games as a coach with him and left him eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime and the line-up of the Rangers team felt inspired and could not reach it.
While the Rangers are now slipping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian through the difference in goalkeepers.
And there could still be problems on the rangers after the farmer Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, and that was due to an object that was apparently shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard switched sides eight times, which gave him the opportunity to let Ayr go behind him and get into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose Livi 11, which cost the Hearts a point last week, and he would have been thrilled as his well-drilled team here faced opponents every time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had more with the ball they had.
They could have scored a goal for two minutes in the game, as Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his big chance to score.
A deep free kick from Keaghon Jacobs to Captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defense only the opportunity to shoot from afar on the poles.
The Rangers were able to win control, but it looked more hopeful than faith and her game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly had the feeling that he had been awarded an eleven-meter after a quarter of an hour as he joined the Steven Lawless, but settler Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers shot only twice in the first half on the goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problem firing Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one can claim that they didn't deserve it for their effort alone.
Once again, the Rangers agreed with a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and selected the menga for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard reacted in the break and traded Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which practically had a direct impact as the outfielder overthrew Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came down from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to deliver to the visitors exactly the kind of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have continued to take advantage of this lead in the last few moments, but McGregor held Jacobs to the bass before shooting Lithgow from a far corner.
The Rangers here turned Glenn Middleton had a further right to an eleven-meter as he went along with Jacobs, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac the inventor of the violin
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September the 30th, 1882, exactly 136 years ago on the day, and still further SAID ... the spy physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" violinist was born in Germany.
The violin has developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the violin target.
The violinist, since a major supporter of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, in 1950 the film "Bells of Colorado" was released with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who likened more cowboys as scientists:
Man: "What is it then?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser targeter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you listen to the sound of the headphones, you can hear the effects emitted by the atoms through the radioactivity and the minerals."
Evans: "So much, but now it's dry!"
The "Hans" violinist died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which is named after him, is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can lead to the detection of benign cells in the immune system
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect and kill benign cells.
Vaccine contributes to the immune system, as it can recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient and then converted to the lab
They can then recognize a protein that is in many cancer cells and then is re-injected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman who was treated with the vaccine, which contributes to the recognition of malignant cells to the immune system, the cancer of the ovary disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, then converted in the lab, so that they recognize a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then splash the cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "treats the growth of various cancers," including breast, ovulatory, lung and duodenal cancers, as explained by Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "additing" them, as one cancer cell has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tiara, with a MAGA cap, after his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West has been blasted at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after a far-reaching performance in which he credited U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be a presidential candidate for 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which means Ghost Town, he wore a cape with the inscription "Make America Great," squatting against the Democrats and reiterating his support for Trump.
"So often I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'"
"So if I were to be concerned about racism, I would have been expelled from America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocks himself over the board of Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Cloaks of Sexual Harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the West's tirade was uploaded through the social media of comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock was trying to sneak up on the West with these posts.
The West has also complained to the public that he has backstage problems due to his cap.
"They've beaten me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the cape like that."
They've bullied me!
And then they said that I was sunk," he said, as the Washington Examiner said.
The West went on to say, "Do you want to see the sunken place?", followed by a statement that "he would undo his Superman costume, then no one can tell me what I can do. You want the world to move forward?
"Try the lion."
His comments were at least twice brought to Buhen by the audience and the SNL crew looked as if it was embarrassing to them, as Variety writes, and one person told the publication: "Across the studio it was totally quiet."
The West has replaced singer Ariana Grande in the last minute, wanting his colleague, rapper Mac Miller, had died two days earlier.
The West has irritated others with the performance of the song I love it, wanting to be like a perrier's bottle.
The West received support from the four-seater conservative GroupP TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "And one of those courageous caps: THANK YOU, THAT YOU HOLD THE MOB THE STEEL."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is "just who it is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I choose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or his 'art') in which I like to spread a harmful ideology that my community might like to do.
He's free.
"We are too," they said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had changed, and although he would now be called "the artist who used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the later museum-style Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."
Try Murduklo over knife picking in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendants will face trial before Belfast Magistrates’ Court.
The report was reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington is attacking masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his pivotal role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on screen young men often feel that they have to mime the strong man in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, the kit said it must have "something gone wrong" and applauded how one should address the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The kit, which recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, is reported to be "quite sturdy" on the subject.
"I'm feeling personal, quite strong, at the moment - where did we go with masculinity?" he said.
"What did we bring men when they grew up, according to the terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that television is partly indebted to the rise of harmful masculinity, precisely through its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is taught?
What is being taught on television and in the streets that young men often miss the right side of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
"There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admits that he doesn't want to make a four-part or after-story of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, and says that he has enough of "battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, the kit is worth seeing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a devil.
The actor has said that he finds his wife's knowledge of Rose the best thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in that series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-created fantasy series, Rose played the Ygritte, the lion of the kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on instructions from Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has reached an increase of 14%.
Health experts say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
The 40,000 new cases were all reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual contact, which marks a difference.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who were on the way to being infected with HIV had been reduced to almost zero, as Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate protection in their relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to get the problem under control.
Maxine Waters denies that Maturity workers leaked dates from GOP senators, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denied the Saturday rumors, according to which a member of her senior staff had published personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrats then insisted that the claims were made by "extremely right" figures in websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," the Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the information released was apparently private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the message line had a line to the Waters office, and they have released information about a member of Waters' mature workers, lawmakers told The Hill.
"These unwarranted claims are completely false and an absolute lie," says the Waters.
"The members of my senior staff - whose identity, personal information, and security and dangers are the result of those inaccurate and false claims - have in no way anything to do with the leak of this information.
This unwarranted claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' appearances quickly found criticism online, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"It's a denial," the man wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of having something to eat that one has not eaten, then they are not allowed to be roses.
You shouldn't be defiant.
No one should be allowed to ask for the reasons of the one who is lying and questioning.
There has to be a calm and calm."
The meatman has manifested himself to compare Waters's reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who were accused by critics of robbing the Donnes during his disobedience.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who deserves to fight the waters and disputes, also posted his opinion on Twitter.
"Wow," he tweeted.
In this statement, the Waters said that this agency "informed the appropriate authorities and those responsible for the application of the law about these false allegations."
"We are confident that your sins will come to light," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable for actions here that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson Parody
It has become a tradition to now look into all new British films Brexit screenings, which did not seem appropriate in its revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise. This began in 2003 and was rebooted in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
What is the value of this ironic self-satisfaction, which obviously makes us stupid, this nation is an export opportunity here?
Anyway, the glamorous and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his patent for a second time to spoil everything – the name of him already says enough, and although, that is a wide-ranging comedy creation, which is open to non-English-speaking theatergoers.
Hen is of course a damned secret agent who, although he has a comic address for idiot glamour, a bit of a Clouseau, a Mr. Bean stroke and a bell of that type who has a single nut to be the "Chariots of Fire" chief member at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also actually based on the traveler and international man of the mysterious, who once played the Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, and who left chaos everywhere.
There will be one or two good moments in this current Johnny English film.
I was thrilled by the scene where Johnny English arrives at a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades clatter briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's donation to physical comedy can be seen, but the humor feels "understood" and comically superfluous, especially those "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible want to offer more translation comedy as an ingredient now.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids and not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's dumb misadventures just aren't as original and focused as the Atkinson's dull-dull sketches in the person of the bean.
The current situation is that the United Kingdom is facing a serious setback.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret internet network of spies in the UK, revealing the identities of all agents in the compound - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drops that bring the barrel to the surface for the premiere, a pompous and competitive figure who's already involved in a total collapse of political unrest: Emma Thompson makes her best with this quasi Theresa-May character, not with it much.
Here the secret girls inform, every single spy and danger is that she has to bring back one from the pension.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now employed as the school director of a distinguished establishment, who becomes secret courses like one becomes a spy: a few beloved jokers here, the English want to set up an Art School of Rock-like spy school.
The Englishman is sent back to Whitehall for a brief briefing and emergency and reunited with his old-fashioned sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sobering role in which the Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin who are all wrong in the name of majesty are back in action and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister dangerously loses a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and de Bough begin an odyssey of Farce exchanging maneuvers here: disguised as servers, they set a French restaurant in flames; they cause chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English leaves behind some anarchy as he tries to familiarize a virtual reality scene with them.
All the sketches are certainly taken out for the last sequence, but so friendly and burgundy is everything, it already has something from children's television in bulk.
It's kind of mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't believe it: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's fair to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britons to introduce a four-day week, which will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party seems to want the heads of enterprises to return the experiences they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers through an extra free day.
This would mean that employees would have had a three-day weekend – but it would have been paid off.
Sources say that the idea with the partners of this economic agenda would be consistent and would also be in line with plans for the country and in favor of the worker.
To switch to a four-day job week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way to give workers the advances of the self-changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced at the end of the year.
It's not worth it to happen overnight, but a four-day job week is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy and favoring the employee in the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party wouldn't be the first to come up with such an idea, which Green had already succumbed to in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
But at the moment, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to square his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he would have decided to seize the power of "faceless dictators" and "profits" from prosperous companies.
The shadow chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies would not be able to attract investment here if a Labour government could demand certain "deductions" on the basis of wrong practices.
He also confirmed plans that saw employees placed in the quarry of enterprises and the so-called "Inclusive Ownership" fund should pass 10% of the profits of private sector companies to workers who could then receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy said "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation could change opinions here
The FBI's investigation into orders against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed an impeached vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, prompting questions as to whether the FBI's findings could persuade Republican senators to support it.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything new that would lead them to change their minds here.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course I do," Kennedy said.
"As I approached the audience, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, and he came out, and really said, "Do you want that?"
He was determined, determined, determined."
But Graham's voice seems to have been written in stone.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh stands firm and there has to be a particularly strong settlement to change those," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: The board fought it fiercely," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"Anybody they call can't verify anything.
It's 36 years here.
I don't see anything that could change the situation."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday's worth to be held in New York again at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual museum event that has earned an immensely impressive line-up of stars who perform, but has an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth watching thousands of people at Central Park's "Great Lawn" to see not only such musical acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw people's attention to the true goal of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), the people attending the concert need to do a number of tasks, or "actions," such as working as a volunteer, writing an email to a leader in the world, calling someone or other tasks that will help you achieve the goal.
But how many successes does Global Citizen have, with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an honest way to demand from people that they become active or again a further case of “clickivism” – people who like them would make a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 11 million "actions" from these backers since 2011 that are geared towards different goals.
They say the actions have helped them bring global leaders to announce commitments and release policies worth more than $37 billion that will help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and reports coming from these shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the collected money has so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main engagements, including The Power of Nutrition, is a UK-based partnership of investors and investors who are committed to "helping children realize their full potential," and promise to – having received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can socially address malnutrition at a crossroads in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at the 2018 Live Concert.
The group also said that more than 5,000 shares have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which more than 5 million women and children value.
In response to a FAQ on the website, which asks "what makes you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It's worth a long and hard way - heiansdo fail and fail me.
But as all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, if we are successful, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just a few of the artists who will perform in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The U.S. could use a navy blockade to restrict Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington said that "if necessary" they would put the Navy here to hold off Russian energy from coming to the marches, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke rotted, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria – where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – would be only a four-way street to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just as they want to be in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, transmitting energy," he said.
And if anyone can believe in him, there will always be ways for him to go.
"The U.S. states of America have the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block to make sure that energy does not come to market here," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance - an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer."
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are turning, more or less, in order to exert pressure and replace fuel," he said, while in the context, viewing Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The allegations come while the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural liquefied gas to Europe, to replace Russia, which is a significantly more debilitating option for European consumers.
To this end, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which – if one listens to Trump – would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is one of several economic projects.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to Washington's project is simply driven by economic reasons and that would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for consumers to decide on this provider," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. government has criticised Germany for reiterating its position on the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading industrial organization, has withdrawn from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "good to see" whether she will be a presidential candidate for 2020, said the senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would be "good to see" whether she would go to the races for the presidency after the clashes.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the Warners confirmed that they were considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and flick our futile government and that also means a woman at the top," she said, according to voices from The Hill.
"On November 6th, I'm looking forward to being president and running for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying he "would lead the country in a wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren has so far been open with this criticism of Trump in his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, the Liberals told the Warrens that "of course we need an FBI investigation before being elected."
It's been a long time coming, but it's clear that Warren doesn't like his own voter turnout for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eighty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probables" are of the opinion that it should not be contested.
Twenty-two percent found it to be a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support for the governor of Vidrun, Deval Patrick, with eighty-eight percent who are due to enter and eighty-five percent who are in favour.
Other high-profile Democrats named in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January to go unnoticed, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
The track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He was arrested in the middle of the night because of domestic violence.
"What my body is going through, what it has been going through since and back home, I can get along with other families who have struggled with PTSD ramifications, and come back with the injuries our soldiers have suffered," they told an audience at an event for Donald Trump.
Palin called his party "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "returned a little differently, they are more horny, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, joined."
He has been arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic bodily injury against a woman, and that together in the report to general domestic violence and possession of a gun in an alcoholic state, according to then Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C., Support Defiance for New Asylum Policy
Sixteen states in the District of Columbia are supporting a legal battle for a new U.S. policy that bans victims of gang violence or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of 18 states in the district have created a memoir "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions Closing, which the American Civil Liberties Union in August defied federal policy, has not been publicly acknowledged.
She said her partners "and its violent constructions, which are gang members," had mishandled, but U.S. officials had filed asylum applications here on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states here that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of demands for U.S. asylum come, as nations that have constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, attorney general of the District of Columbia, told the Freiden in a statement that the new policy "would ignore state law, federal law and international law."
"Federal state law requires that all asylum seekers be granted the facts and circumstances of the request, and such a court goes against that principle," says the "ami de la cour".
Affected people continue to argue in the memo that the policy would not allow immigrants entry, which would harm the US economy, they would likely want to become entrepreneurs, and an "important offer of workers".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded that judges only be allowed to grant asylum to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is possible for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear on the basis of their race, religion, nationality or wish to be a member of a particular social group or political opinion," the session said on June 11 in its presentation of the policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people have to deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubled compared to survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly unpredictable.
"Everything is going well," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to calm her little fiery babies at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there's an ambulance coming in.
There's almost no clean water."
Survivors were seen returning to their destroyed heads here, looking through the most tainted properties to be able to save anything.
Hundreds of people were injured and the spectators, injured by earthquakes of 7.5 on the judge's scale, were charged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulders, were rushed outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated for the inconvenience there.
As he told of the feeling, as it was at 5 o'clock in the hotel room, which he shared with his wife and his daughter, experiencing a brutal earthquake, he got tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been teased in the ruins of the walls, I love it," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I didn't hear my wife yelling, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's going on with my son or daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement crediting the benefits of reciprocal U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of engaging the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China’s paid advertising in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after a Chinese newspaper alleged that they were trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China disputed.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to put pressure on China, a U.S. official said.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for trade, Beijing and Washington are facing a de-escalating trade war, which has led to higher tariffs being imposed on each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to meet exporting states such as Iowa – which support Trump’s Republican party – as well as Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa – a major export state of agriculture to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers, and businesses like that.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is now lending another ship, by now posting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"Through the spread of propaganda, the Chinese government is going against the long-standing and long-standing tradition of free speech in the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street in Beijing, there are few opposition voices and it is not worth finding a real reflection of various opinions that the Chinese may have had against the economic development of their country," he said, according to the media of the Chinese Communist Party.
He also said that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers did not want to print his article," although he did not know what kind.
The Republicans are estranged from women's electorate ahead of the confrontation with the debacle of Kavanaugh, analysts warn
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stood up and went on to defend against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned against a counter-reaction in the twinning, especially by women.
Emotions around this subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Such things can't be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article that was published Sunday.
The plaintiff said that Senator Jeff Flake (R – Arizona)'s last-minute pressure to have an FBI investigation was worth bringing only pink voters with him.
"Women don't deserve to forget what happened yesterday - they don't want to forget it and they don't want to forget it in November either," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, the Liberals, when one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The liberals chanted "November is coming!" to protesters as they went off the Senate floor, while the Republicans, who control the "Judiciary Committee", decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the exception of a Dr. Christine Blasey Ford report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely valuable," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's high; it's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called female "Swing-Welser", and the fourth and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who – although they did not like the president – often do not get elected.
Even before Ford's public outcry, in which they dismiss an accurate description of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it could retaliate if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"This is a confusing turn for the GOP," Micheal Steele, a former Republican quarterback of the National Committee, told NBC News last week.
"It's not just the committee vote or the ousted vote or whether the Kavanaugh judge will be, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps Democrats choose to become a television.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divided about what to believe about Ford's and Kavanaugh's appearances, although there's a tendency to believe more of them.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's looks, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that the Kavanaugh was likely or definitively fired during its appearance, while only 30 percent said that was true about the Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI has now begun investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other clerk, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian has written.
Last week, Ford ruled out the Senate's Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had abused them in the drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominees exposed his genitals at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that is supposed to be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored here and who has access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind the break-up was "world domination."
"We've got to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to set up their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on a browser, and that's constant.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it completely depends on the user, who can have access to what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, process qualifications, and appropriate yourself to be so solidly accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of the Berners-Lee, the Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several senior employees working as developers on the project in a community of volunteer coders.
From that week onwards, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app here with the tools found on the interrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should make a complete change to where all business models are being put on their minds overnight.
"I'm not asking permission here."
In a post on Medium, published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the break-up is his "mission to deliver commercial energy and an eco-system that is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on solid."

Bernard Vann: World War 1 pastures celebrated with "Victoria Cross"
The only clergyman from the Church of England who was ever awarded a "Victoria Cross" as a fighter during World War I was celebrated in his home village after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was brought in by a sniper four days later and never conceded that he was awarded the highest British military victory.
A commemorative stone was unveiled at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "greatly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after the action of his father, who brought him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918 "through thick fog and under attack in the field and by machine guns."
He later ran to the shooting range and led the battalion again, before taking a field weapon with one hand and holding up three of the military unit.
Lt. Col Vann was brought in by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a mountain before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said he "couldn't do justice to his grandfather's actions but it would be a humble experience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after the parade, to which the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band led.
Michael Vann says that he "feels very honored to be part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a true hero is proved by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine the following: You've stayed up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206, only to be denied access to the main event's cuisine.
The plan included 13 fights from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown on Channel 5 live throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., just as Guard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to join forces, viewers in the United Kingdom were puzzled as the reporting on Peppa Pig was changed.
Some were unimpressed, after which they were extra vigilant for the fight until the early hours of the day.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a prescription from the government that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, as he was told on the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," jo.
Bellator company president Scott Coker has said they want to revisit their schedules to engage viewers from the UK in the future.
"I'm of the opinion that when I think about the replay, I'm of the opinion that we can probably do that," Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock in the morning and we're not in the position to wait until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, as it turned out, they were sent a lot of messages to and from here, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to figure it out, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a real problem.
I can assure you that this won't happen again.
We reduced the fight to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we tried to deliver the fan more, but we blocked it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feels masculine' in sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he would have grown up with the feeling of being inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he came to secondary school that "not everyone like me is."
In a conversation with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had talked about the school rights to give others "hope."
He also said that he wanted to be a parent, so that he would be willing to give up on winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to an illness.
During her appearance as a graduate in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he had the feeling of growing up "worth being more" than anyone else, because "was socially unacceptable, loving boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, the feelings, the less will and the less will be felt, the only things that have given us the strength and endurance to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "worth something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone if they found out about his sexual preferences at the end.
The double bronze medalist at the Olympics is one of the most well-known LGBT advocates and he used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he said this because he felt happy, to be in a position to live openly and without consequences, and to make other "hope."
The three-time world champion said that leaving a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When someone so young, so throughly passed" - he participated at 1 year in his first Olympics and his father died three years later in cancer - he said it was difficult to find someone who was as old as he was and the same age as you.
The couple became parents in June to a young man named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie."
His brother-in-law had the same name as his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not here to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped with uncles and it was first when he stopped with uncles and was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I'd been dreaming of all my life - diving at the Olympic Games in front of a crowd at home, there's no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – that he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still caused a hangover with him.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson at the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to reshape his form to avoid it becoming an unlucky milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event, which takes place every 2 years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four a Saturday.
Instead of standing at the center of the action, as he did so often for the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day playing cheerleaders and working on the range in his game, hoping to improve what he plotted.
Not even at the height of his career he was the most successful driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal cast for the narrow lane of Le Golf National, where the long-running Rough penalty shootout.
And if the ties aren't frightening enough, in Game 9, Mickelson encounters British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who forms a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans start the 12 individual games with a four-point setback, having a difficult start, Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely important.
The man's confidence has been shattered, and it's not that he can say anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, got me on the back, laid his arm around me and said that he was ready," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's been on the team and he's been on the team this week, and he's been on the team this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I've been thinking more about it, but that's how it worked and how we thought we'd have to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could represent the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never truly reached the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Fury said his presence had brought the team far more tangible benefits.
"He's smart, he's sarcastic, he's moody, he likes to cuddle with others and he's a wonderful person who loves someone in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had a lot of fun when they were with him, and also this week, which was a nice look.
It's more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major advance can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead for the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can turn very quickly into an uncomfortable rider.
Denmark made their debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it still won by a margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but also just a short one," Bjorn said, conceding the 5th National, after leaving the 2018.
So the story will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over yet.
Give me everything.
Get out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see points on the bridge.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and then we have to keep focusing on it.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 games that are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Easeed as his players hit on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the foreground.
We've got another one in front of us.
They're the only ones that have the power, and that's another one.
It's great to be out there with a partner if things are going well, but if one is out there alone, then one is tested as a golfer up to the blood.
That's the message the player has to convey: Get your best.
Now let your partner go back and he must now go his way and also be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better than they did as a partner, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Fury himself knows both sides of those big turns, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before they went as losers of the place, because Europe played out the "Wonder of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered his players before the last day.
"We've had 12 important games, but you'd like to welcome the quick start you saw in Brookline, the one you saw in Medinah.
When the pendulum swings in one direction, it exerts a lot of pressure on the middle players.
"We've got a lot of people coming in and we've got a lot of people coming in and we've got a lot of people coming in and we've got a lot of people coming in and we've got a lot of people coming in."
Thomas was given the task of trying to perform the performance and faced Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the other half of the lineup.
"I chose this setup because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of his individual choices.
Germany's new warship lost again to Hannibal
The new frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but it is, according to local media, due to flawed systems and ever-greater costs not completed until at least next year.
The order of the "Rhineland-Palatinate," the flagship of the frigate class Baden Württemberg was now, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", citing a military proverb, until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the reassuring problems after the delivery faced the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class, ordered by the Navy as early as 2007, were thought to be an ersatz of the aging frigate of the Bremen-class.
They have an impact-powered rifle, a range of flight and ship missiles, such as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible that the new frigate does not run to the home port for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean that the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove Germany's impact and oversight – are already out of date before they even contest the service, notes "Die Zeit".
The F125 frigate pursued by the accident made headlines last year as the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" by which the ship was rendered useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class were operated by a team of almost 120 sailors – as soon as the staff of the old frigate of the Bremen-class was downgraded.
It has also emerged that the ship has a lot of weight, which reduces its performance and detracts from the ability of the navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class employed by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the sensitive hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including the training of the team – will also be a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are mainly due to recent warnings that the German naval strike force is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy was "spending on the assailable ships."
The official said that the problem has worsened over time, because old ships have been stowed, but no new ships have been prepared.
He argued that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were in the position of joining the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of Flantermais
A new research, which is based on a plot in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how flantermais use the landscape on their youth after meals.
It is hoped that the results will shed a new light on the behaviour of the unique fly mammals and will help to draw up guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and is commonly followed in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern but also bronchial Laangour and Daubenton Flanthermais at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders are placed at important locations around the ground piece, to monitor the flyer mouse activities throughout the season.
The staff of the NHS and volunteers also carry out mobile surveys with the help of hand detectors.
Based expert analysis of all records determines the frequency of the flanker mice and what kind of thing does it.
A map and a report of the living space are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of living space are most important for butterflies and how they are used by any species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of living room management work, such as the sheep of wisdom and how wood floors are best laid out for flankermais and other similar types.
The population of flannel mice has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are driven by buildings and development work, which affect sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Movers and lightning can also pose a risk, such as misalignments and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attack of house casings.
The squirrels aren't really blind.
But based on their nocturnal judgment habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the beginnings of predators.
They use a highly developed echolocation technology to eliminate insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the fleet of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major farms and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Flanders very seriously.
They have been trained by ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, sleep plaza inspections and heiansdo rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides a habitat for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The land manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal landscape for them.
"We've got a wonderful place to stay," he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's a lot we still don't know about flantermas, and the work we do here and on other grounds helps us to better understand what they need to be able to do."
He emphasized the importance of looking for flantermais, first of all a maintenance is carried out on land, because an insignificant destruction of a single breeding habitat of up to 400 females and young flantermais can kill a very local population.
However, they are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their living space.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to come forward to help.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about flashbacks and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo has been accused of rape and wants to declare his affiliation to the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charge against him a "false report" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using their page name.
His affidavit is intended to declare the German news magazine "Der Spiegel," which published the false allegations.
The storm of Portugal and Juventus was reported to have raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is alleged that he then paid $375,000 to avoid bringing the incident to the public, the "Spiegel" reported a Friday.
As he was reported hours later about the incident, in an Instagram live video chat to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reporters as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today, they're false reports," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or in the camera.
"She wanted to make publicity for herself by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy and very good man," the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's affidavit prepares to declare the "Spiegel" for the false allegations, which they call "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Affekot Christian Schertz said that the player wants to "promote a decision for moral arbitration with a sum that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which will be one of the most difficult violations against personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and the Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped anal, according to documents from the Clark County District Court files in Nevada.
The mayor claimed Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and had told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" apart from the "one percent."
The documents claimed Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had sex, but that one had taken place with mutual consent.
The mayor also claimed that he had gone to the police, and that he had photos of his injuries shot in the hospital, but later agreed to solve the case <0xC3><0xA0> l'amable, because he had "great fear of retaliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to leave the union, as she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was just about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged transfer, and this summer he switched to Italian club Juve with a 100 million deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom 'gives it forever' to lose car manufacturers
The UK would "give it a lasting impact" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "congratulatory" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK would leave the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"I need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis were produced – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK falls out of the EU, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also raised concerns about the EU's exit without a deal on how cross-border commerce should function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what, according to automaker Liverworker Risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "completely synchronized," with parts arriving every 37 minutes from premium advertising companies in the UK as well as from the EU for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border, which according to the industry could lead to delays and shortages in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock of more than a day in the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and as a result production would be halted.
Clark told Theresa May her checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We absolutely need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to grab this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The sound not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we have to be absolutely in a position to predict what was an extremely successful set of levers."
Toyota was not in a position to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union officer of Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have worked out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein will be postponed, according to the White House
Donald Trump's eloquent meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed another week," because the fight for candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Federal Court is still short-lived, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Sunnereikot Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible Russian meddling in elections, is investigating links between Trump supporters and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy justice minister and thus put the independence of Mueller at stake is the number one issue in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about being tolerated to record conversations with Trump and about the possibility of deposing the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
But last month, he went to the White House and, according to reports, he was able to go there.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time with the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to "expel" Rosenstein, but you were lured to avoid an overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, sexually assaulted him.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meetings, she replied: "No date has been set yet, it could be this week, it could be that I have to give it another week after, with all the other things left at the Supreme Federal Court.
"But I'm still here, and I'm always looking forward to it."
Some reporters have questioned the allegations: Sanders has not held any press releases from the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace is in charge.
Sanders felt that the lack of information rounds did not stem from a reluctance to TV reporters who are out on "effect harassment," even though she admitted: "I don't dispute the fact that they are engaging in effect harassment."
You have suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is holding more R&D sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without evidence: "We've looked at the numbers."
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, then it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've seen that we've done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and that will replace a press briefing if you can talk to the president of the United States in the future."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or with reluctance to attend press conferences.
Press conferences alone are soul-searching.
In New York this week, the president may have proven why, by putting up a labyrinth and a thousand bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland due to Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and wished that they would remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter to the UK leaving the EU less than six months ago.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to accepting the costs of an application for a regulated status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal have progressed over the summer and there are expected decisions for this autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must be a good time for all of you.
That's why I now want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, where patients and the communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay."
In the name of Christion Abercrombie, no head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has had an emergency operation after a head injury in the 31:27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened shortly before half-time.
"He's come to the front door and he's gone," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline and laid him on a beer and brought him for a further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center OP.
Harris added that "there is still no detail about the nature/extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a fellow athlete in his 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He has a total of five tackles on Saturday, before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty if they buy a piece of land in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a piece of land in the United Kingdom, with the additional tax being used under the Tory plan to help the homeless.
The move counteracts the success of Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The tax rate will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Financial experts expect to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a piece of land in the United Kingdom, with the additional tax being used under the Tory plan to help the homeless, Theresa May is eligible today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, incite young voters with promises, prepare more viable lives, and target well-earned earners.
The stamp-tax increase is aimed at individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional sue intensifies the government's fight against sleeping on the street.
The additional tax – that in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homeowners and coffee-for-loan-houses – could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance experts expect the step to reach <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK citizens, which drives prices and the air and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foothold in residential construction.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – are turned into "spiritual times" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new directive comes only weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying land, but not using it, and he urged Mme. May to give up quotas on viable homes to "require housing" from the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a striking array of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to forced evictions "without charge."
He also wants to give the community more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would use my time as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that it is necessary to repair the shoelace.
The UK is always on the lookout for people who live, work and want to build a life.
It may not be true that it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign companies, to buy housing such as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the degradation of sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to eventually become Scotland's manager.
Schott, 42, enjoys the challenge of re-entering the North-East club, which ranks third in League One, three points away from the top.
He entered the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing back St Mirren in the last season to the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland).
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-head and that was all," Ross told Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of players from Scotland in Hampden as a child with my father and that's something that always brought me back.
"But that would only come if I were successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he's not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, despite having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successfully, the moment for me is measured by the following question: 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, there is no doubt that he belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the offseason and the third league and turn St Mirren from the offseason candidate to the championship title winner the following season.
Ross says he now feels better than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a mess," he recalls as he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was the right one for me to play even more than that.
It's a good idea, but I've had a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed some of the great things about it.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot to do every week.
I'm still doing this as a stress and pressure through the work, but the administration just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now where I do it, it feels like the best thing I've done in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a pint is according to a study at 5:30 p.m.
The heatwave of the summer has increased the recipes of British pubs fighting for survival, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw an increase of 2.7 percent in July - but recipes and restaurants fell 4.8 percent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, which brought the figures together, said: "Continuing sunshine and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup has resulted in July having followed a similar pattern as June, with more than 2.8 per cent of the pubs remaining there.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June was further exacerbated in July.
The pubs and bars in which they were drunk were cut far more heavily than the restaurants had eaten.
Pubs and those eaten also fell under the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to have a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, drinking sales went up by 6.6 percent in that month, while food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman of leisure and hotel analyst RSM said: "The results continue to drive the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impacts of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the off-home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a sales drop of 4.8 percent from year to year is in addition to the ongoing cost pressure, in particular.
The long extremely hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators in the iron and steel industry and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August are bringing such a pressing expectation to pause."
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including re-openings, rose by 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in brand openings.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – part of whom is as old as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and schoolgirls, according to a survey
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an uptick in "false insta" pages
It's been reported that sexual harassment has led to sexual misconduct
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" that showed them to their parents
One in five children – a part of whom is as old as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students uncovered a rapid rise in "false insta" accounts - a post on the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has prompted fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would run a crowded "main account" that they would show to parents while also having a private one.
A mother who went to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called out to her, "rape me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK at the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, the halls of which admitted to running private accounts.
HMC's Mike Buchanan said: "It's outrageous that so many teens are tempted to create online areas where parents and schoolteachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "speaker of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the Supervisory Board as a Supervisory Board member.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated light athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has seen the step as a significant opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of their wide-ranging experience internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the athletics community of all of Scotland, the United Kingdom around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we took the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm delighted to be acting as a linguist for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help promote the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre lap at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and holds a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after having a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've been hit by a mountain.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said, only with time it turns out, whether and to what extent I am recovering.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to go again and today I'm doing mobility exercises!
"Thank you for the upkeep!"
It's a great way to connect with moms who want to make money online
A company for milk pumps has online with an advertisement that compares stealing mothers with cows who are stroked, the mediums are reached.
For the introduction of the so-called "world's first unobtrusive milk pump" the consumer technology company Elvie has released an unconventional music-video-inspired advertisement to experience the freedom of milk pumps – the new milk pumps – that are designed to meet the needs of mothers.
Four real moms dance in a suit filled with Hee to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I groan to myself, but you don't see a dick" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't adults, they're my breast."
The choir continues, "Pump of, pump of, I feed my puppet, pump of, pump of, I strangle my dams."
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it evokes the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a pretty bad decision to use to promote this product.
Just as we had to get them pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies were removed a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into the stem supports (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understanding traumatic as well for the mother as for the puppies.
"Why don't they use a milk pump to promote mothers who care for their puppies?"
Another added: "It's a bit of a snag."
Others defended the advertisement, while one mother admitted that she found the song "immensely funny."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still stealing.
By the time I got to it, I felt like a cow.
It's a bit crazy, but I think I've figured it out.
"This is a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a sleazy advertisement aimed at mothers who are pumping (often at their work or the toilet) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pumps that were placed in their supports.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who are able to pump milk say that they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is quite unobtrusive, has no twist or sludge and discreetly fits in a stud and offers women the freedom to move around, hold their puppies and even get out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner at ECD at "Mother," commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a powerful and provocative introduction.
By pulling a parallel, between pumping mothers and milk, we wanted to raise the pumps of milk and the related challenges and at the same time demonstrate them in a sustainable and tangible way.
This isn't the first time Ellie's father has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mom for designer Marta Jakubowski walked over the catwalk while carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children stabbed to death in a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the alleged border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the Trump administration's sharp rhetoric and the guidelines imposed by them have made it more difficult for children to sponsor.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and risked their own ability to stay in the country, putting on the game by registering to adopt a child.
The risk climbed in June, as the federal prosecutors announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their state would have to give up fingerprints, and that the dates would be shared with the immigration prosecutors.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children of people who had been recruited to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been previously convicted.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
"We're going to keep going," Albion said.
When trying to get the children to work faster, officials, according to subcontractors, introduced new rules, whereby some of them had to appear before the court within a month of the arrest, instead of after 60 days (the previous standard).
A lot of people seem to be using video conferencing instead of personalizing their case for a legal status as an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for the aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which according to subcontractors and reports known in the last few months from the system can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Afekote indicated that these concerns are further reinforced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs based on the size of the facility will be overlooked that a child is struggling with it.
They added that the abandonment of children in the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to tell friends that the trauma with which they are struggling could be even worse.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey immediately withdraw their "occupation"
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has not lasted for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally staying on Syrian soil with the pretext of counter-terrorism and are being "defended in accordance with them."
"They have to go straight back and forth without conditions," he told the assembly.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as it's been," where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of others have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus is "continuing its holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian areas" of terror groups as well as "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said that the prayers for them were in line to return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" which urged refugees to stay away.
"We have worked with the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these reversals," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to announce a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, argued that the deal had "clear deadlines" and he expressed hope that the military action would "take out" jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front and the Viseiro.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and establish the way for elections.
Al-Moualem called for the participation of the Syrian government in the committees, saying that the work of the council should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term in office
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the new elections in 2020, except for how many liberal spectators are likely to hope that a resignation or a scandal would temporarily end his presidency.
It's been said that "the most dramatic end of a presidency has ever happened!"
So far, however, there has been no public outcry from the audience.
Since 2014, rates have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN's main broadcasts and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million lead-time viewers, four years ago it was 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" peaked the cable rating with no less than 3.5 million viewers at midnight.
"This is a celebration that people don't see, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, ABC's Designated Survivor series chief of staff, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol destroys it.
Nell Scovell, an acclaimed comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The chauffeur told him that he would choose Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
He replied, "Well, he brought me to laughter," the mum said. Scovell told me.
In the chaos, it's a mess.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the actions of the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigration families are reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring this is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged spectators.
And on top of that, it exceeds the understanding of an informed citizen, Mr. Trumpe, when he's been waiting for himself for six hours, to see a panel discussion of experts on the Bob Woodward's use of "deep-grabbing background", which is the source for his book "Paul Duar"
For example, I will never see Super Mario with the same eyes as before.
"Part of what he's doing is letting it feel like it's a reality show, like he's putting something on a reality show every night," said Brent Montgomery, director general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's show's spin-off.

ings from the outside and the middle walls for the races around the house
It's not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania saw a cash flow, thanks to the redevelopment of the congressional districts, which received two officials in a race around the same seat.
This recent new suburb of Pittsburgh is to the detriment of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a solar election last spring in another district.
The Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the ament to the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been manipulated in violation of the Constitution by Republicans.
The race for the new 17th led to an exchange of arms for campaign funding between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name after a short victory in a much-observed solar election in March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The session was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Democrats had a clear advantage over the Democrats.
The U.S. has called on El Salvador to censure China's support, but has renounced it.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already ignored Beijing, without much resistance from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners removed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. leaders of their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement beginning on Monday.
However, only punitive measures were taken against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, which cut financial aid payments and opt for visa restrictions, have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With progress at internal meetings, the officials of North and Central America relied on a high-level conference with a focus on security and economic well-being, in order to conclude a similar meeting last year, which took place as a step towards achieving progress in efforts to
But in mid-September, leading officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be preceded and thus effectively reduced all transfers for punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence must now arrange the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for imports that the administration is setting for the meetings, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned very quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no news or warnings from Washington.
A representative spokesman for the White House for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, given by the three American Houses, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal reviews on the conditions of anonymity.
Her reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
The history of learning
Your next job message could be to Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal challenge, about which there will now be substantial evidence in the public files.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, wants to find out with his investigations about Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia to attack our elections.
If Congress is to be reassembled, then Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility before the new assembly, sooner or later the electorate will have to show itself again, and perhaps even a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's demise is unavoidable - or that of his European equivalents.
We all have to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that have resulted from it.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, in which democracy's relentless march is accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is currently facing some of these challenges.
What do we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who steers the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he secretly took the president and speculated that he is not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is flawed.
"What will our reaction be if Brett Kavanaugh's newly demanded F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is sued in the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual assault and outrage against him?
And, above all, will we in the midterms choose a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we don't meet these challenges, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess who was deported from Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial homeland.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, she sent me off to start sabbat candles on the table with the swastika.
With that in my legacy, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna a Donneschden is aware that the victory against the Austrians, after starting this month in Spain impressively equals against Villarreal, brings them to a strong position for themselves for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury has left midfielder Graham Dorrans holding off his first game of the season since playing the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he thinks the Rangers can use this result as a spring break to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"But we went into the game with the belief that we got something and they went home with a point.
In the end, we'd probably know it, but in general, an equation is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were the better side in the second half.
It's a big European night, it's a big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but with the spectators on our side, I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now it feels like there.
The team is good and the boys all have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully we'll be able to move forward and be successful in the last season."
Women can't sleep because of this fear of retirement pains
Even if the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be ensured, few people talk about it with members of their family.
About half of the individuals in this nation-wide study said they were going to talk to their partner about the costs of long-term supply.
Only 10 percent said they were going to talk to their children about it.
"People want to be insured by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of nation-wide their life insurance company.
That's how one begins.
Talk to your partner and children: Your family can't prepare to take care of you if the animal doesn't make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get support, as the choices play an important role in calculating the costs.
Involve your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help to find an opportunity to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include a traditional insurance for long-term care, a hybrid cash life insurance to help cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
You're in the process of creating your own legal documents: legal disputes
Establish a health insurance policy so that a person familiar with your pet can review your health care and make sure that professionals know your wishes in the event that they are unable to communicate.
It's also a power of attorney for your finances.
You will be asked to select a person you trust to make your financial decisions and to ensure that the bills will be paid in case you become incapacitated.

The man was shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was on his way home after being forced out.
The victim, aged 40, was shot in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, as he was shot in the chest, lower body and hand.
Gendarmes described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
They don't want to see him, and the police don't want to see him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a strong earthquake and tsunami, which hit the Indonesian state of Palu the free, so the households, with the expectation that the number of deaths will continue to rise.
Because the communication capabilities have collapsed, the official help was unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, a district in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a secluded bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was in the process of celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquakes and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of the Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite lying coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit frequently by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamei killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the midst of a seismic fiery cycle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the past year:
2004: A major tsunami on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than halfway there.
2005: A series of strong bends hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 strong south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, hit and caused a tsunami that engulfed the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 strong bend struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 strong bend hit one of the Menawai Islands, after Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial beating hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and triggered destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of deadly beatings in the tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered that time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Larger numbers of tourists hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaksa and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for aggressors.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was found guilty of domestic violence, alleged domestic violence, and of resistance to a detention, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, as a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspected crimes, he took away his phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 indebtedness, KTUU reports.
He was a samsung before the court, where he declared that he was "certainly not guilty" as he was asked to confess to the debt, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three class-A fines, which means he could go to jail for a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, punishable by a roof in prison and a fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been caught.
In December 2017, he was arrested, and his father, Todd Palin, was arrested.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the suspected attack.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, it was reported that, due to domestic violence, a report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon during a drunkenness was linked to the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had slapped his face in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia's tsunami earthquake: hundreds of people are dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit a frigate on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the next few days.
The quake struck just a short distance from the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the shores.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
The Saipov, 30, allegedly used a loaded home depot truck to carry out the attack on a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists who were in his path crossed in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "desired" eight people killed and "desired" serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to demand the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
The two witnesses may be sentenced to death, according to a court order.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury appealed to Saipov for a settlement of 22 shillings there, which includes eight shillings to help protect money, which is normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a shilling for violence and destruction by motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and thought," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov carried out it as "cruel, expedient and pervasive."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered injuries, pain, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since her Southern District of New York has finally pursued a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life in prison for killing two drug addicts, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy for two years prior to espionage for the Soviet Union.
The two Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told the police that he was going to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the statement.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flags in his hospital room, the police said.
He didn't want to take a look at the 22-year-old.
David Patton, one of the federal duty defenders representing the Saipovs, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute them.
"But think that the decision to consider the death penalty, instead of a confession of guilt and a life in prison without the possibility of being released, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has already asked for the death penalty not to be considered.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Brexit Negotiations Lead
Nigel Farage vowed today during a protest at a Tory conference that he would "mobilize the People's Army."
The former Ukip leader said politicians were measuring "the heat" of Eurosceptics "must" - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march to Birmingham that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May's previous call to bring the deep separate ranks back together has been underscored by pro-remain tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping track of their Chequers' compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, remainers in the EU.
Allies have insisted that it should continue fighting to get a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – and the Eurosceptics and Labour should be forced to choose either its package or ‘chaos’.
Lord Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he was going to get the checkers out."
He suggested that the Lord Farage should have a peer and be given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he's going to die, we're going to die," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I stand up for Brexit but we have to get the checkers out."
To make his opposition to the EU clear, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Lord Bone has suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: the idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely wrong.'
Tory Brexiteers Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, and said to the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really go through the streets and lead us to be elected at all.
When I leave, I let the Chequers fall and begin to listen."
In an accompanying report to Mrs. May, it was added: "The premiers will keep their job if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that the politicians must "spin the heat" if they were to pass the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to get past Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'don't let them get away with it.'"
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, I added: "Because our political class, which has just passed Brexit, is leaving the heat on.
"But mobilize the people's armies of this country that have given us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remainder marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists, following the group's founding this weekend, were aware of the Tories Against Brexit banners.
Labour's Peer Lord Adonis has cracked down on the Conservatives because of the security issues they had with a party app as the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know the IT systems and all the technology for installing Canada plus plus, for a seamless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
The Democrats are planning to become a "serious" candidate for the presidency.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was "seriously looking to become a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke to the Saturdays about their future during a speech in the town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran in November to be re-elected against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-defendant of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been the center of speculation that has countered Trump in 2020.
The Saturday Night Live event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate in the town hall format since Trump took up his post.
One of the candidates asked for a candidate for the presidency.
Warren responded that it would be time "for women to go to Washington to flog our poor government, and that also means that a woman must be at the top."
It's been a long time since the LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, have announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting against basketball player Wayde Sims a freelancer.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting, and asked for help to identify the man who was seen in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early on.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a blow to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told Samschden, according to 247sports.
Wayde grabbed hold of his colleague's help and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he shot the Wayde Sims.
The Simpson was arrested without a warrant and was arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is more familiar with the World Championship title after the team's success gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It is clear that the Mercedes team series will play a major role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified the Samchden ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost took out Hamilton while defending his position in the first two tiers and the Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and led Hamilton to drive the traffic to the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes drove a lap afterward in the pits and was behind the wheel as a result, but the Hamilton became first after a wheel-to-wheel action, because the Ferrari driver unwittingly had to release the rear and risked still undervalued for after a double maneuver to advance to the third.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first tour on his 21st birthday.
He was then the first to hold his tires for a majority of the race while scoring a quick finish and to take over the Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He ended up on the 44th lap and drove the pits but he was not able to raise his rhythm in the last eight tiers yet, while the Raikkonen got fourth place.
It's a tough roof because Valtteri has been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me along.
The team then did an exceptional job to have one of two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a joke at a rally with Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that he did not lie to Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what the Senate enacted showed that people were "even and honest and dishonest."
"That something could happen and that's beautiful what's been going on during the last days in the Senate when one sees the turmoil, when one sees the roses and the bad ones and they're honest and honest," he said.
"When someone sees what's being done public and licked and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get it?
Do you remember his answer... did you read the document - 2oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't lie.
Oh, wait a moment.
"No, we didn't," he said, urging the senator to speak out.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein disputed that the leak from his office was known.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his disposition did not come well to the president, who commented a samsung during the rally: "I tell you, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continued to nominate his defense of the Supreme Court, which was approached by three women for sexual misconduct, suggests that Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They want to get back the power with all the means they need.
They see the beauty, the honesty, they don't care how they do it, how they have to cross paths to gain power and control," reports mediaite as what the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have faced off against the Belfast Giants for the loss in the Elite League by winning a 5-3 draw in Dundee.
The Giants were early ahead with two goals through strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the balance back before the Giants were due to the Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard scored the first two goals for Dundee against Lukas Lundvald Nielsen Goaler.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from him to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on a free evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaull Assist, with David Rutherford giving the assist while Beauvillier doubling the lead four minutes late.
In a busy starting period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and brought the game before Matt Marquardt left Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that the Giants will be ahead with a lead and the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to an equal level with a power play goal at 27:37.
The Cownie and Charles Corcoran played together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure that they won with his team their fifth in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match a freestyle.
Flylots die to make sure that the hounds on the plane can escape from an earthquake.
A fugitive in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while wanting to make sure that a plane with hundreds of people is safely coming in from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake hit the Sulawesi island, triggering a tsunami.
The area is heavily populated and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even though his co-workers fled to save her life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the volatile control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He stayed to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely fly away.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought it was going to collapse.
He then died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
Sea prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to bring him and me to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him to these walls before he reached the helicopter Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear it," he said.
Meanwhile, the agencies said the number of deaths could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to go into the light, because many bodies still lie under the trenches while others cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman, the Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Wells that were up to 6 meters high were destroyed in Palu, where a sun is held a mass term.
The military and the military are in the process of providing assistance and support.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
"Mini-majors are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is making a quick move to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I pray you all to work night and day to complete your tasks in the framework of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane decommissioned: Air Niugini now says one man has disappeared after plane crash in Lagoon
The airline that flew the plane to a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one man has disappeared, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was about to sink.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that since Saturday night they can't get up for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to inquiries for more details about the passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats have helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water as it was tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to the police, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers will remain a samsung in the hospital, and that all are in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact abandonment of faith remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane had gone over the pier.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had been devastated.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others had completed it, through the water that went up to the hemisphere, up to the safety exits around planes that were sinking in the passageway, wading
He said the stewardesses had panicked and feared that he would have suffered a small stroke on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked on improvements to a shipyard also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to land before the plane and about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water went under.
Data from the flight safety network indicated that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents of PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An analyst retraced the time span of the night and said a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded a samsung's statement of her case in a second investigation by a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst Paul Rowlett of the Department of Justice has been exposed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retraced for the jury how a cell phone data used to compile the movement of 29-year-old uplifted Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many mobile phone operators who showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, which contradicts his appearance of something, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford put out a sash, and claimed that the roof was not in the city.
When the investigators asked if Tellis was going to tell the truth when he said he would have been in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going to "lead because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconvenience was that Tellis said that he had known the Chambers about two weeks ago when it died.
They've only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that after some time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted his cell phone's text messages, phone calls, and contact information from Chambers.
"He's out of his life," said the Hale.
It is expected that the defense will begin to become their last arguments.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later.
What's the most popular hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive message.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claim that the hip hop has gone from its origins of political messages to the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently become popular in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
What's up with Black?!
The New York Times reports that a young girl has been arrested after being sent a "racist" text message
A New York baby girl sues a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that it was "another black."
The couple argues that they are racist, and compares the complaints with "oppression"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed shock as she found out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, would be black as it came for her first day of work in 2016.
"Nothing is going to happen," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
But instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After noticing the fauxpas, an "inconvenient" plasco-flaxman fired Madame Maurice, and explained that the maid who had just gone, an African-American, had done a bad job and that it was expected to be a Filipino instead of the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and was sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for a compensation from the dismissal, and expects a compensation of about $350 per roof for the 6-month job it would have lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, so you don't do anything," said a freedman of the post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple countered the allegations that they were racist, beating back, and saying that it was the reasonable decision to demolish Maurice's attitude, fearing that they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Do you want your children to be able to take care of themselves, even if it's a bad thing?
Your newborn baby?
Dajee."
Plasco said, while comparing the complaint with "extortion," that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Isn't there a person who's running?
That's not a good way to act," the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, and arrested them for their behavior and their logic.
The Paddington publishers risked that readers could not have reference to a beer that was talking, a new letter after.
To Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to resist the position of someone who is reading it first before it is published.
"It's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's success."
It said that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before one was inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, rose if his work had not been accepted, and said that the 60th birthday of the book was "after his death."
Regarding Paddington, who describes him as a "very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a person who broke himself," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like one could have achieved something: it's a real pride in it even if it's not a work of its own.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the service to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone.
After landing, his daughter and the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital were brought to Nice, where the doctors tried to save his life without success.
"Nad has often called to say that it looks very bad, that it is not expected to be worth packing," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say that he would die in the next two minutes and that I would have to say Edi.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm close to that.
I'm going with the sense.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart at bay have slowed and slowed down and left his system.
It was a short time ago and that was just the end.
I just sit there and wait, knowing that all this is going to happen.
I couldn't stop crying or crying because I was in a situation with family and people.
I'm really rapping together."
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, who is currently in mourning for the loss of her daughter, has to climb into the plane with the other passengers - without knowing what to do.
"Nobody knew anything," she said.
"I put my head down, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but at the end of the day, I felt a tremendous amount of sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women's suicidal ideation in order to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide have labored to keep others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support, even though a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis her son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel all day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising goat with a rising line.
"Everybody knew about it because of it.
"They've always said that they're going to make a difference no matter where they're going."
But he left his job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time he found his sibling after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly concerned that there will be consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there are people out there who can go to one and talk to one, even if it's a friend.
"Don't be shy, you've got to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for years, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he felt bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized that we were going to have a different story.
"Christmas was at the end - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or so."
It was said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to be one of them: "It's a laughing matter for the whole family.
It's going to take us out.
We all have to fight and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on an unstable equilibrium while the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we really could get something like what he asked for - a time-limited investigation, with a limited scope - then we might achieve a little unity," said Lord Flake a sigh, and added that he "fell in fear."
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your recollections are completely up to date.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans get poor results, then they will be strongly weakened in their attempt to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met through him his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going on with the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 Senate elections, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to get an equaliser and challenge him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea 'fails' under Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea and South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-sug cited data from the Union Ministry in the south and said that last year there were 1,127 survivors – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and the large cost of human smuggling play a major role.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans in the region will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that, since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of the flights over China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross, are as much as the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees survivors first as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly sends them back to their own country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which technically still lead to war – have improved sharply in the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to conduct talks on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agree that they should work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has issued U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions it will be impossible for us to disarm unilaterally for the first time," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he would not be eligible to serve in the Supreme Court in his temperament.
Pelosi gave the comments to Samschden in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, she would have said 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Donetsk.
Kavanaugh claimed to have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were both emotionally challenged by the two teenagers.
While in his early statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly having a hunt or drowned while talking to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "great and coordinated reputational assassination campaign" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements in his own way as he spoke against the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed concerns as it was asked whether it would attempt to unblock Kavanaugh should a vote be taken, and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying this - if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only not fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in court where there's a degree," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he would have been concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative justice.
In his hearing, Kavanaugh asked about the possibility that he was going to die out of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, partisan person to take to court and then expect us to say 'that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And the women have to do it.
It's a fair fight, months and years of anger that flooded, and didn't get out without screaming.
"We're going to get married," said Mrs. Stone, 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leader somewhere, where she said she would cry if she rose, but that she was developing a technique, which means that if she rose and started to cry, she would then go to the person she was going to cry with."
I'm a rose."
And then it just kept going.
I thought it would be brilliant."
Tears are partly allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of a previous job, in a mostly male office, where I crashed into an uncle with indescribable anger, was that an old woman took me by the colli – a cold manager in front of whom I always had a little bit of a fear – and I had a little bit of a crush on her.
"I'll never see you again," he said.
"They don't know that the rose is the bass.
They will be sad and happy to have you back."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extraordinary affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the course, Mrs. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that there should be no further thought about the idea of becoming a presidential candidate for himself.
"It wasn't a good decision," we said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was already late in the campaign, it was behind with donation collections, so it swore that it wouldn't go into the courses unless it collected $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, gave him just $250.
"Do you think I'm going to get a refund?" he asked.
As it kept its word and announced that it was not launching a formal campaign, it was so overwhelmed with feelings – gratitude for the people who supported it, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sex.
"Someone might think I've had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalls her reaction to the press.
"I'd like to say that I was a corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking that I was thinking, what would they write on my grave?
"Did you crash?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first ointments of the trade war between the U.S. and China have made one daffodil, and even if the fight is not over for a long time, a break between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warnings earlier this year by spending a major Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting items worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so that in the end half of the sheep coming from China and the US were spent.
Beijing has hit back every time, and has set recent tariffs at five to ten percent on U.S. assets worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to join the U.S. shot-by-shot, and the world's second-largest economy won't move as fast.
If they were to stop Washington, they would have to respond to demands, but publicly making themselves small in front of the U.S. would be too much of a blame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the U.S. pressure in the trade war could positively support China in the long run as it reduces the interconnection of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic turmoil in the two countries is ultimately much more dangerous than spectators have been aware of so far," said the Abigail Center of the American Academy of Sciences.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it would be ready for the refugees who want to return and is looking for help to rebuild the country that was devastated by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country would be improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the anti-terrorist forces that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions have now been met for the return of the refugees who want to return to the country and the missing refugees due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily life and their living situation.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people living in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept any deserving help or the help of countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup as they beat Team USA with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who has had most of the tournament problems, shot his tea shot in the water at par-3 of the 16th laugh, as well as losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all his rounds, and is one of the 4 players who have ever had a 5-0-0 since the tournament took the current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out with 5&4 by the worst player on the European team's rankings, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best-placed player, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2 and 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most wins of all time in the tournament with 25.5 as a career point.
"I don't usually cry today, I can't do anything else.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for taking me with him and for believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup again.
I'm going to the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He will be the token at his country school, John Ram, who defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game one Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel in defeating the Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A comedic statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles second to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been having trouble finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time when we were celebrating the European Union.
We've been fighting.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA of America in our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to make one of your own.
We've been beaten."
