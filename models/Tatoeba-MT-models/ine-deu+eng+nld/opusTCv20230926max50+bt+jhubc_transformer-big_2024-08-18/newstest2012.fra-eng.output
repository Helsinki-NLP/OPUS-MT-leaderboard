Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
In the second reading, MEPs rejected the proposed amendment aimed at reducing the sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having entered into an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is expected to rule on the convict's appeal in December.
Tymosenko called the ruling a political revenge of the regime and provoked a process of suspicions of partiality of the court also in the west.
The proposed annulment of paragraph 365 of the Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Victory of Libya
Liberation or Libyan rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but they are the moderates or the radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of the Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya is becoming a crime-free country because for a theft you cut off your hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the eventual disrespectful of their faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot imagine and we certainly would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, objectively not the best, and probably not beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that Islamist warriors have accepted the help with the recognition of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Will oil companies have easy access to Libyan black gold without occupying the soil?
Perhaps not so much, and the West will eventually be able to boast of disinterested protection of human rights.
As little as we prevent these adherents of the sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed through Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published the GDP related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is expected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1% expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (this was the cause of the stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecasted and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The yields on Spain and Italy’s bonds are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation in the region worsens.
Voices are heard in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football team has accomplished its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and keeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended heavily with good luck in the second part of its qualifying and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech national team also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defense.
The vicissitudes of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech team will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box office.
From the first few minutes we played a football fighter.
Both teams struggled to mount combinations and the game was concentrated mainly around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not break through the Czech defense, which responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is being processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest report that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and take charcuterie for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important is the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, charcuterie is found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of the big ones, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have signed up for this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed reported eating 5 times a day, for example, breakfast – in case of lunch – tasting – dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of student families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats their breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed regularly do sports, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diets based on possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years old are far from ideal, in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a particular preference for sugary lemonades," the results of the survey said.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading to Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
“During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet was based on the results of the survey.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sugary lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potato rolls).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen afterwards.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "busy".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically narrow wide arms, extend a neck or add the necessary curves.
We have thus come to emphasize the character beautifully and also not to dress too visibly types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
For example, if there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothes that fall impeccably are priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly slips, winds and does not hold the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker-style outfit, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously a lot of examples of different looks and I'm glad I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
At the bottom of my head, I'm happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds lately (please don't take my statement completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
In this way, the stylist not only dresses the physique but also creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, entertained us with all this.
But that, until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single outfit in a different way.
Variability is paramount for this example.
Like for example this trench coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with shoes and take it in a photo like a dress.
Or just lift up the sleeves or collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to contravene it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do with, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is, for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen templates) I have to be ready to "cut" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists remains frivolous.
And familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem passes to the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling done by us, we then have to count on the fact that he dictates to us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we just have to google and make sure if the boulevard info mentions the celebrity in question, if she has leaned or thickened, etc...
Honza and Mario asked us on Sunday that 'it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, do not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort her closet and fill it with new items you can't throw it all away and tell her, 'My God, what a horror.'"
“You’ll find some things that you’ll find pretty and he’ll advise you how to wear them,” Mario says.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on you for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or pins, there is also nylon yarn (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if they are too large (the pin is not a staple or other type).
So that we were not just people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of class
I’m starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is contested across America.
Revision (disambiguation)
At first, a trouble-free race turns into a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it into a routine morning commute to work.
It fills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it serves no purpose if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled The Run has produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be during which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set pulls down due to a few unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them begins to participate in illegal races throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the stages planned in different environments that differ quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also quite nice even though the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
The events are in addition from time to time adorned with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly decreases your visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the timer) and then another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police that comes into the game and tries to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
It’s more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help them by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing too complicated.
What’s surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete, there are only three).
The result is like this because this element is not likely to be disturbed and, in the context described above, is placed in the elements that adorn the game.
The model of driving is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at the moment, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, that of collisions is not yet in place.
We don’t expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you don’t have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it’s not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other lightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy volts.
Or it gets in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The reboot is done in such a way that when you have broken your figure or you have gone out into the scenery the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you have used all 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes reboots do not help and you need to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of itinerary in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that you have to pass in a certain way, otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given location "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent pass easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and bypass them or brake.
It doesn't matter if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a lot of times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it does not matter if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during races.
You need to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes as you can change the car there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic twists on very technical drives, for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature, which among other things compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other features in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway that sends the car directly to the scrapyard.
At the editorial office we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or if the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What is bothering is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful.
The sound is good and the track is a choice.
In order to please as many and especially the younger audience a new soundtrack was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
Need for Speed: The Run is so confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs Behave Like Negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from Charles University's Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how seriously she took her motto "understandable and open about Europe".
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the very beginning, there were criticisms that he's fade, that he's a round-of-the-leather, that he can't fulfill any missions and I have to say that he took everyone's breath away because he's holding his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards unity and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis states, such as China or the United States.
No one wants to ban us our syringy (cooked pasta cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has reached its peak" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that is still being resolved.
In addition, the new seven-point budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be slender and with a view to savings, which branch will take priority, which countries will be the most, the least, all is to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an Understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syringy".
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us.
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, it is sad to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, stems from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, the Magyars, the Slovaks come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group doing?' and he's not happy at all."
According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future, tough new fiscal policy rules are waiting for the member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails rather than a "new European federation".
“We have countries in the euro zone and others outside the zone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
In the first place, it was said that the countries that want it and those that do not want it co-operate with each other remain in their corner."
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," said Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to establish the basis on which all issues having an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not only members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses IBM's strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first chief executive, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved unless people are willing to think.
Its slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company culture carefully crafted by Watson.
For us, IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This enabled us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more," said the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic – IBM people were the only ones among the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, an employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and commuters.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at first brilliant at discovering talent- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman—Virginia Rometty—who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing what is called jamy, brainstorming online, from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the field of business.
“From the very beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is commonly called in the United States with respect to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the banknote dispenser, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM was the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year with $220 billion (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed in betting on a proper operating system OS/2, the online service Prodige or the computer IBM PCjr:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead you can’t emotionally hang on to the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the competitor Microsoft which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenue, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preponderant place.
However, still in 1990 it was with more of the participation motive the strongest representative of hardware.
As of the year 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investment.
It now appears that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
IBM's share price rose 120 percent from 2008 onwards, and the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can therefore expect this flexible giant to be able to cope with other crises.
IBM History: From slices of cheese to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him lead the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that so far rest the identity and culture of the society.
Watson ran the firm in Kusqu in 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to $9 million and the firm began expanding in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management, his son took the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969, the flight on the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the IBM 5150 name came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company from Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its goal is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and urban management.
As far as the field of commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps merchants to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our area.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in the summer in her house, she had no doubt that her couple would not stand.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he publicly confessed that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's bond and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is having sex with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the doorstep of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova filtered by showing that she broke away from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I will stay with Iveta and I will not change.”
"My wife has set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"We talk to Darina in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop her.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Women’s worst vices: Does it concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that happen to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your half make you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and pack at the time of sale?
In your case, we can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think that they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the window sill of clothing stores, to look for yourself pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do I like you?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more poisonous women become.
The odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust, chop the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, soiled the living room window, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"With this overcoat worn out in the trash."
“Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?”
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this digging work on your partner in this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much dirty work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflation but also insults against someone are also typical of some women.
Women are particularly attracted to relationships and are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each one of us let go of a little harmless glimpse here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr has twice participated in the Philadelphia win during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again at the top of the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
After the match, Jagr told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling comes over you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palette and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first pause, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t mean he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said of his centre.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
“I’m really happy about that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shootout she ends with a difference from a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I got some speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," Voracek described the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in second third due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the back line was sick which mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost punches as they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement was not enough and we could not resist.”
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our zone."
For that we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax Jets goals, which stopped a series of 5 games lost.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination to the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the prerequisite for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The travel of the Czechs has experienced a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 vacations in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, Czechs spent 4 million holiday days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbouring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip from the Czech Republic was at that time to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage increased which caused another important moment around 1997.
As a result of increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charter services since 1997, which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to before.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the US which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to completely fall into the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including the accompanying charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this could end in a situation without a solution.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months now, and it is likely that Ivan Hasek’s successor to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after yet another General Assembly to be held in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting regulation should be adopted.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football go backwards towards divergences between the Association's chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations were blocked and there was not even a question of how to deal with the election.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials vested with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance also of the Office for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still disagreements about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the fact that either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," stated one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round that of the candidates who will have received the most votes as a percentage within the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to be withdrawing so that the candidate who will have received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentage of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian part and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the settlement of elections established under the statutes is the most Pelta advantage among all candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any misleading ideas imagined by a representative as at the last General Meetings," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
In his opinion, there will be a new President in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"The possible qualification in the European Championships today should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more drive for cooperation," adds the Jablonec official, who among the three has the greatest experience in terms of football management both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
"It's not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This may cause another blockade at the General Assembly."
"I still hope that common sense will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of retaliation.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which has to determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for the position of President because he does not see any correct candidate.
If Plzen's head of football Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not be campaigning for this high office.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him, and I don’t stand for election.”
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of the AFRT that would a priori be favored for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event he wins the elections he would hold this position of President only until the 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the role an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be especially embarrassing Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and Plzen Regional Football Union President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the voting of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, that would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What is still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during a hearing as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without any pain.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik wins Thursday's vote, he should prove he can cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association, he wouldn't be able to."
"I'm not putting my nose into what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September attracted a lot of attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and that he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated its triumph in the first division last May with its support.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik added, noting his antipathy for Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power over high-level policies would result in more game tax money for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should address."
"If it's about the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"That's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my shares of the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future quarrels about the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and thinks that today's success of the football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not take place promised precisely to devote himself to the national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to run at the last minute just before the last General Assembly and this delay of two months might well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, has worked for a large number of years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to direct Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone realized.”
"If there weren't all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has attracted the full attention of delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I’m willing to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn’t work.”
“It’s a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he knows well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
“He’s been playing football for a year and he’s had some success.”
“His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.”
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
It should be a football game.
“And I would also try to finish all the business that starts with the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we will manage to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," Pelta said optimistically two days before the day likely to be decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by his predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national team, professional football and high-performance youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a specific area.”
"And I will be distributing difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“As for me, I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'm going to have people behind me who are going to keep putting sticks in my wheels and casting doubts on each of my actions," he said.
“A lot of people have told me I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“For the last two years there has been a lot of de facto work and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not want anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election, the situation within the Union would return to the way it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen.”
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for tolerating one."
“I’m trying to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are any who say otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like at the moment with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and know that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who envisages saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
“If elected, he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a noticeable change among the people in the Commissions.”
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
The Julia Stanek
UFO sightings, beautiful Budapest swimming pools: Who travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in gaseous water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past 18 months, there’s one item that shouldn’t be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretching on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and was not short of admiring the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her diary all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she has presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain). The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true lover of the bath culture.
Meder explains that she doesn't have much interest in the sport but he feels drawn to the water in a completely different way.
It's annoying that swimmers should just gaze at blue tiles and settle for the smell of Javel's water while joggers breathe the scent of captivating spicy forests or can hear the gassing of the park's joyful birds.
"I wondered one day why the pools should actually always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the reinforcement of the architecture
A dip in a pool and the volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other side it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, stepping stones.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>l) in J<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xA1>lsz.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you have the whole city in front of you, you can admire the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the piation.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel water does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur odor, from the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanate a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its lime sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded plot of land.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
Looking out the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to the Black Forest.
"It's already a nice yield that of fusing such different building styles into such a formidable unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
German Bank Examines Commodity Speculation in Detail
The Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Global Commodities Exchanges pushes prices upwards and that banks share an accomplice to global famine.
The consumer protection campaign aligns concretely against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that the bettors have detached themselves from the offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to criticism from American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "No business is worth putting at risk the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently reviewing Foodwatch-Report's allegations.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - usually with a recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode praised the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how much today’s banks are hurting the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, if it’s about hungry people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which wagers on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would not recommend such a bank to their surroundings, 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account to change their banking institution.
21st house in Vienna
The pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the World Exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is reopened and takes place as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bright and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer is for a good example in a universal exhibition in Brussels.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is still considered to be an important stage in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was so long used, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has increasingly collapsed.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now called the "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvéd<0xC3><0xA8>re museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way.
The new beginning was completed by Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has particularly accomplished the work of transformation among political men and public protection.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and through its change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "an energy gap," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sealed light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of the originals remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against rust of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the office of monument protection," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and lightweight.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the "quarter of the central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments totalling around 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway facilities and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to get rid of the snow and ice piers until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing a lot for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after an axle rupture occurred on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if Deutsche Bank’s problems weren’t enough already, the industry giant’s past catches up with the US as well: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros) to settle a dispute over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
NCUA, the financial market regulator, has been accusing major banks of inciting cooperative banks to make false promises about buying financial products, which would have minimized risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have dragged banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating proceedings in court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
In comparison, the Bank did not admit any faults.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and it intervenes in case of bankruptcy, to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks apart and in the summer he assigned JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs to the Court.
With regard to the question of mortgage documents, these are "mortgage-backed securities".
Houses of credit are at the bottom of it.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date back a few years, at the moment there is a stormy wind blowing on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies to obtain reparation or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has unleashed the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, both U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for being advantaged in kind during mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without citing a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Increases IBM by $10 Billion
Buffett, the finance guru, invests huge sums in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, it has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the big US investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies shows only poor forecasts.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his mind about investing in this sector.
He should have understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knightly attack in the world of finance.
As a result, IBM's IT business is granted the right to call itself "Mr. IBM".
Buffett revealed today on CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never heard of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who, even during the economic crisis, had secured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services as the operation of accounting centers.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffett is more concerned with rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and established it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a market value of more than $220 billion and ranks with Apple and Microsoft among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media questioned the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many Germano-Turks, the long-deadly specter has reappeared: since the incendiary bombings in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this far-right extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been questioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimensions are far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right mess.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted rationally: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought about a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Hürriyet" did not deprive itself of unambiguous conditions.
"it starts to puer", This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was very critically perceived in the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to do research in certain suspicious far-right circles, the authors wonder.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"It's going to be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen writes.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which distrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of ourselves in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, had himself represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if a man’s value could be measured by the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turks is towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandalous bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and is in the meantime running from crisis to crisis.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; we knew in July that he would occupy in 2013 an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained solidity and made kind remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from the month of September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and flared about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has since been considered a sufferer - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administration already in May - not in 2013, as announced by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All of a sudden he assumes responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of “Europe’s biggest scandal bank”.
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saves the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also clever, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an affluent clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich recounts: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have just been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going around at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli surprisingly retired, who until then was considered a top intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we realized why he had left.
The division of the bank had flammed with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this, it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have blinked: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that one never even learned its name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was due to announce billions in losses again, and board chairman Marcel Ospel, who was still the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state, given its investment mistakes.
The national bank bought from UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
A few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the removal of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
As a result, the bank lost its credibility in the two main business sectors within a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a somewhat calm return, and as it was thought that the UBS would get away with it, it was followed by this unfortunate story of stock marketers: a single stock marketer flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not going around.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banks this still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we found that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Institute of Banking.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure of this: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over the risks."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great a risk, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong image of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Zurich Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers such as Tiffany's can be found here among the traditional Swiss shops as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive at the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another strayed from the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become much too large, he finds – especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have further spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And even so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The UBS crash."
With up to about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a large group together.
A bank was created, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and has been steadily growing.
What helped is that the two different banks of UBS have completed: a rich but lethargic bank with the strong point of asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with UBS's rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied on Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli Group always uttered the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of banks at that time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, the corporate advisors, who were responsible for it, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and leaked valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
“Still in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there,” said Geiger, the bank’s expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been stalled.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
On Thursday, bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be transitional when the bank split with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must conduct the business of UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He has so far only said publicly that he and his wife were going to get an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.

The jugular industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its germ.
General relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half filled last week, not half emptied - but now the problems are pressing again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.

U.S. investors have expressed themselves in a skeptical way: “We are not an island, on the other hand, dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis," he told CNBC in an interview.
Therefore, it was in his view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the winds and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of business management.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, freckles are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these very intelligent animals have not let themselves be chased out of cities for a long time.
Some people love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The snails have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying due to the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the “bird problem” is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on currants, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the fringes of cities.
Experts from all over Germany have discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Protectors of nature also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected frogs: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, arranging and cutting down typical nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
Corals are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with gourdins particularly brutal.
“Normal expulsion, eviction, is of no use,” said Werner Klöver, the city and landscape planner for Leer.
Destruction of nests using pressurized water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals move away, large colonies divide, and they disperse to other places."
Expulsion is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceiveable is a combination of the eviction of animals with aversive packaging and catchy offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "information panels instead of chainsaws" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-road-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent friezes.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Here's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say about each other".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freaks not only use working instruments to get to a treat, but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four frescoes recently, how far the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crash a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning snails then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four frescoes can be achieved right from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo pulls Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal has cheated against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected, after the 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff game back by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first innings (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more burning in the 0:0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) draw against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Est<0xC3><0xA1>dio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the grid.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting skills and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a head ball directed towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark awarded a penalty of 11 meters played in the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the European Championship for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also got lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossbar had to come to the rescue of the world-class guard of the Czechs already shot, again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his place on the bench of the third of the 2002 European Championship in the same way, the Croats were able to rejoice about their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute, with a 4:0 success.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalised for visitors.
Ireland pushed to top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that the defense of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first striker.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on hand and would squeeze the ball onto the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China over the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales by 2015 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded a revenue of almost 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now, we want to expand our business (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
Mass-slaughter of personal
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," begins with a long list of characters that will take you to heart.
A tip to get started: Carefully tear this page and make it your bookmark.
In this romantic story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mist of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately described as "a work of anti-history."
It contains a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors or discussions about strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like" that contains "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulance workers and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose limbs, go crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives here waver like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund’s book deviates from traditional history books.
It denies the idea that the First World War is only summed up by the terrible trench war on the Western front.
"Beauty and Grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells of corditis.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you're a mother at home, do you stay or do you run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on the substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of rice crushed into sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
It states that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and declares about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending to be such a snail.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When you are resigned to sacrifice yourself, you hope to have an audience,” he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a convicted man strangulated in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the early century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into blindness for life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund’s prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps how the war “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came out of his book, grabbed this page with your hands where the list of people is and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which went against the department's regulations and spawned a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The policemen had prepared themselves by observing the progress of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was held on the island of Randall, with a view to the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are getting better training against riots — counter-terrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police quickly — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park came “at the last minute,” said a regular, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise.”
"The few policemen I know who were called did not know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the man said.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people would come and go to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so one o'clock in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages ringing from the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many demonstrators simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were touched before 1:45 a.m., police said, leaving time for occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the measure was only taken for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly held by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the protesters’ dense business heaps, including luggage, plastic turf, and bags of sheets filled with clothing, sanitation department teams followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged, and the images were released on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hanged together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called in to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disorder and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers would be patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if intervention was needed.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police extend the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of whom were equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were spotted digging the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
A policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union is prosecuting the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, 37th District Council, to try to cancel the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who are among the lowest-paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. The union leaders compared these dismissals to a political revenge for not having allowed the city to access a health care fund run by the groups of workers, and which would have allowed it to close.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council responded, noting that school aid layoffs were in no way specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would fill out a notice of complaint, warning the education department that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce prosecutions at Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City Education Department will form the respondent party. The complainants will be represented by eight redundant workers, all black or of Latin American origin, like most school aid workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to underfunding.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island, and few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aid workers at Harlem’s 36 Public School, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutions say that “It’s not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap.”
Public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, “sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” and “not just because of overreach.”
Mission accomplished: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
It would eventually appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It would have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "rebellion".
“This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both sides clashed with the White House over the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the funding of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama’s mission management, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress has been overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell to insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
The Goodlatte Amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Commons only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that "would control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their backers – especially the new Republicans who want to gilden their resumes – the chance to brag about being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is being proposed perpetually, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to authorize the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed down compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a television show Monday night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and said she wanted to recover rather than go back to Congress.
When Gabrielle Giffords appeared on ABC's "20/20" newspaper, alongside Diane Sawyer, she struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show tackled his difficult return following the bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, traversing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang – and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded “pretty well.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", aired the day before the release of the couple's new book titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special program traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords from the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved, and a large scar on his forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast on ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
“So I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t beaten,’” Kelly said.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you'll get out of it, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City’s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie suit stood at his feet to acclaim him.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were presented as some sort of orphan,” the senior military official wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has established itself between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military say.
The public acts more and more as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves up in the role of unlucky minds.”
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of returning troops from the Vietnam War has been far worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from combat with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service in two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were getting him through the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to keep up with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from combat.
“When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls as he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we did in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a soldier’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces the Growing Pressure to Severe Against Rapists
This week, a major hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She returned to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
“It was an alarm signal,” Elizabeth Lyman said.
But Texan has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I should have followed my intuition.”
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man caught her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and some not, will be anxiously awaiting the court decision in a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a trial will be held against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The latter are accused of not stopping the spread of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided justice to the victims.
Susan Burke says she's dealing with the wounded military, because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will sue several times, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents said.
The Department of Defense has refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is only inscribed on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldiers’ teams are playing an increasingly important role, including getting in touch with local women.
The result: of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat.
It’s time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the military, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Rights Service's Women's Action Network (Military Network).
His group sued the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to handle claims for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported according to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also studies the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases registered in the army were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge at a trial in which she is questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, ‘It wasn’t his trial, it was mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was deported on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and other plaintiffs will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavy against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue as long as there is no reform,” she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who voiced his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken by a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t so hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions posed concerned their own level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook became the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to “Like” publications on the walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the “supernova of data” is generating an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” Bartlett said.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were far more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle-based Children’s Research Institute.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics about the love situation and Valentine's Day, the 2010 midterm election attendance rate and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasury available to other people).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it’s quite another thing online.
“I don’t think a lot of users have ever thought that a researcher could study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Cold and Inhuman": first appearance by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he told a courtroom filled with 500 people.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
“I wasn’t comfortable, but I personally advanced a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find even more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will air this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how creative this spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from an "illness leaving them to think that a great idea makes a lot of work...
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the major copies have disappeared in transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs’ death that a full video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly revamped, is the basis of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technology philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him elbow blows to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely precocious aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them immediately.
Here’s a quick summary of seven notable Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned to run a business:
“For all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" assessed at a glance, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and make long-distance calls for free.
The device has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you were yelling at the public phone and it happened to you a minute later at the public phone next door,” Jobs laughed.
“We were young and through this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't know much about each other, but we did invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by narrating a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have made: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave insanely laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s approach):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first ever designed desktop computer.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles down to sell a few printed circuit boards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a lot of arguments... I was yelled at and pretended that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and I went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are blowing away:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are these types of people] who end up leading companies and product-specialized personnel are set aside from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product – the required manual work.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have made ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
That's partly what makes Macintosh exceptional: the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to examine the issue of political disagreement, namely whether opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be in a way to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Solicitor General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health law.
Guests starring at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers from law-related organizations and others even though the judge may not be a stakeholder, guest of honor, or listed on the agenda of such an event."
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dispels any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the trial court.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing Signs Record Order of $18 Billion for Airline Planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-lane airliners, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing unusual about a company receiving an order for 50 of its products.
It’s a matter of course when the airline in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of those 50 aircraft reaches the record $18 billion.
Equally amazing is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported on ordering the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-aisles.
It was the Dubai-based airline Emirates that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that flatters with significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than one billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel – usually detrimental to airlines as it represents their most significant costs – would not be so harmful to them as the country would make money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have a natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates' order strengthens Boeing's dominance in the large-carrier aircraft market and helps to curb the competitor's attempted encroachment with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautics show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which rivals the Boeing 777-300ER directly.
Airbus is revamping its start-up to increase the push following the demand from its customers to increase its payload capacity and autonomy.
Shares in the Boeing company rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the elections of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s governorship in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her adversaries.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race to the post of governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio during an interview Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only a handful of Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate from the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any link to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the election, a mayor of the NAP was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally renounced the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
The BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to the aid of the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro zone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would hinder the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director general of the Manila-based BASD, said the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He discouraged the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) from looking at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in this crisis together.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point but it is not sheltered."
“So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The thriving sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy is going into recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would route any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro zone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a slump in foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to address and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get 1.2 billion Indians to accept aid to Europe, of which at least 800,000 live on $2 a day, or even less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at age 50 and they are going on vacation in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well-paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the euro zone crisis was likely to cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “loss risks” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defending Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and triggered a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, including civil rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more of cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect combatant troops, Panetta continues.
“Although wartime financing of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets,” Panetta said.
“The contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.”
“The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
“It’s not a consequence that we can live with, and it’s certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself reached the top post of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a news conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen – a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, ill-prepared force unable to face potential adversaries."
"Indeed, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel, and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State officials have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, has posed as an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violating campaign funding related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The cheating stories at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research in such projects, in particular in psychology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don’t sting, blush, or stir all the time.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "centered on themselves" while women tell more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people tend to be (but have to tell lies than unmarried people do).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what is called "setting the benchmark data".
This helps to provide a point of reference for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone is normally waving their feet all the time so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see them waving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of misleading verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly, or present a post-interview relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult issues have passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped away using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceiving individuals can also use distant language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman...Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be disrupted after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect them to the project.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Nebraska dune area, and is confident the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new potential route studies to avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala Aquifer, vast groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, it would have to go through six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have put their bets on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to this plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, centered on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York City claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle, launched in an outbreak of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited in fear.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" tirade scared 18-month-old Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve Monk to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and posed for her daughter for a while.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman with anger.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She got angry and started using vows -- the word "" and the word "" with a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still holding Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms - and had to be held back by her entourage who drove her towards a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started to vomit, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all of the money received to a children's cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-proclaimed of change, which has generated high expectations regarding the progress of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the growth of the economy has not been observed.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical economic decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture.
According to the report from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damages and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damages.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state of mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, which, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, increased the unemployment rate of the state during the first three quarters of the year, there was an accelerated increase in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state of mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, which, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, increased from mil<0xC3><0xB3>n to mil<0xC3><0xB3>n to the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, because in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, while in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, and in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3> <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in mil<0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, and in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3> <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>n, in <0xC3><0xB3>, in <0xC3><0xB3>
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illegal way it is not easy for them to invest in them," they say.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes noted that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been reduced, first because of entry difficulties and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is aggravated by the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's shift is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the FDI of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent in the same period compared to 14 million dollars.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Leave this
Given the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July at the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress has not been observed in the economy of up to 2,600 trillion pesos.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the Government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wishes of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and especially the good work already synchronized of this new team of government, hopefully next year will be much better",
Economic slowdown
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year have retained the state's economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which the freezes, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of e flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Patrons of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources is unleashed," he said.
Lots to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident of Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on June 7, 2010, during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little trafficker was driving in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and on the co-pilot's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Criminal Law Enforcement Center.
Debts to contributions to works
Works of a social nature considered in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 para migrantes are at risk of not being finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has failed to fulfil its obligations to provide contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they didn't give us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, to record no delays, we started the works and we made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the state authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the operations so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing.”
Court approves ‘analog cut’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has overturned the constitutional controversies that the Senate and House of Representatives have formulated against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been collected.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, said President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was overturned for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and even S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The Plenary Session of Ministers also resolved to terminate the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the state leadership.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because this also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has in some form invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assures.
Analysing the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" countdown in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote-by-vote" countdown is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the corresponding 6-votes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral process to enter into force and the Governor of the State of Offomis had the publication of the Journal of the Logoy Ragel
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislature and called the state legislature’s vote for constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because it has no right to “sanction or challenge” them.
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting minutes and the counting in the ballot paper is not in the ballot paper; or there are errors or alterations in the ballot papers.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polling stations of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate who won the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point presented; provided that at the beginning of the session there is a co-petition and an express petition.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the joint counting, it follows that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party from which the candidate was seconded, in which case the packages will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range.
After receiving tributes from the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends visited.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues in the Bachelor of Technology and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the Bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his ashes were spread in the Sierra de Zapaliname, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared a lot for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion on which he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honours we have said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force 1985 as the <0xC3><0x89>cole <0xC3><0x89>cole Felipe Bacio Cortés, which was headed by the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the <0xC3><0x89>cole <0xC3><0x89>cole <0xC3><0x89>cole <0xC3><0x89>cole Mex and the <0xC3><0x89>cole <0xC3><0x89>cole .
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral service to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his sister Amanda and his wife, Cristina and other relatives.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadeyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authorities had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with shots fired in different parts of the body and with the shot, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadeyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km drive from Cadeyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at about three meters, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to the other, except for a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadeyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadeyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, murders, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first fact on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance run in Rancho Viejo, Cadeyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the verge of economic disaster.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government.
He is expected to present a majority cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well laid out," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, market volatility put the yield on Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would greatly support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the majority technocratic government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He will end his tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italy’s debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the new prime minister’s success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should only be formed by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate trying to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, have a large register of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain year-round intense activities in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated European Cup and World Cup playoffs.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, Barcelona's brainflyer, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by UEFA the previous week alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's forward centre, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left-handed J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 appearances and the goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, they include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even come at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to occur in this country.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n on the Internet.
For Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for the holidays; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
We are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this all about?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us had imagined we were going to be a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue making music together thrills us a lot.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't get any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of large crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We’ve been a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started out in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the amazing person that Andy has been with football and how he was always making me laugh from it.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the band we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He is the one who sings it and I believe he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the purpose of this change?
That's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very obscure songs, even if they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs probably represent that to me.
I also think that we can be happy and even like that we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, probably he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with circulation in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official march, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to the information published by the South American country's presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade in goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber goes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed right from the start to take full advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how spectacleless stereoscopy should work,” Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s Spanish press chief, said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “accessible” video game that allows for fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook up less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced players will be able to make a "second lap" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a wink to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber must run through platforms mined with dangers to free Princess Peach.
Even if I player find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeys the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had given way to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done requires an executive proceeding after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former proxy between 2004 and 2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for misappropriating Q120 million from the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
Trinijove’s first 25 years of life are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly educated people, without work, with problems of addiction or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current municipal councillor eco-socialist Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Charitable Director General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Grand Hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is, too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-partying, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street lived was over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, where they were organizing micro-partying that was desperate for neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day forward, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited-, took away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic beverage boxes.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made her unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation area had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise, while, according to her, the troubles were not caused by the guests of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense according to the last few weeks.
The head of the disco explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgave" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civicism that this caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the convening beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for all doors to Collserola.
A door brings back the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elects talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions that three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have come up with.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is opportune.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green house blocks was not carried out at the end.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the demarcation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very demarcation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, overcoming it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can cause real disasters".
By sticking more to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Board of Trustees that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("everything a success", he says) that one had to create: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basis of the competition there is a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-country competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the immediately higher band than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the founder of legal power of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s demanded the payment of an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother PANiste and on September 2 he was arrested and kept in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecution Agent 3 of Patrimony, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when a second detention order was issued to him after the Public Prosecution Officer overturned the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadeyta Criminal Center allegedly for having chanted with a million and a half pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he only spent a few hours in the medium-security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the closed trial in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the District Second Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonas's guilt, such as the one relating to the cashing in of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared in front of the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecution Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been recovered and which of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to case 197/2011, Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is granted legal pardon and subsequently no claim can be made regarding the trial against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for the damages and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was ordered.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He shall also communicate to him the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter struck directly at the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climatic conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contact with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that investigations done in the impact zone do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In research, it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact has occurred in a structural way.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and this happened on a movable ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Vol:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions: -
Reports in the IACM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-level cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew searched for a lower height zone and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the place of the disaster there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope that went from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disjointed himself along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in a wider area than the encircled area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by specialists of the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and adolescents, called the 'Obesity Genetics of Children and Adolescents' protocol that will have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry at the 20th Century National Medical Center Specialties Hospital, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites to participate the population with or without the right, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence to minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (people associated with childhood obesity are sought to be identified) will be applied to all participants.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez reported that this investigation is the result of health professionals' concern about the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity in boys and 47 per cent in girls; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy you consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryness, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary beverages, carbohydrates (tamales - cornmeal paste wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and ashes in genetics.
UNAM’s asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand broken pieces each rainy season in the México Valley Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintenance of the pavement was even completed, it would be possible for the pavement to be damaged.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Crustaceans, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a higher mechanical resistance than those of asphalt, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yields, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltens, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthens, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating forces, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would have spread better, according to the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer called the bearing layer is put, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide traction in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the stresses, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes debris.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only subsequently the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair debris easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's nominee miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her number 14 title as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena (Gar<0xC3><0xB3>nica (198), where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico has climbed with the crown and the scepter (198), the department already includes 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses (198), among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), and Alva Dol<0xC3><0xAD>m<0xC3><0xAD>n (1949).
Today the big question that many people ask is:
What was missing? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Talé Naportia or Natalonne.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the candidate from Valle to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a form of culturalization, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is The Little Prince, it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," it's a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I'm reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "Blood Burning."
This response was not welcome, firstly, because of the term "culturalization" and secondly because it did not explain concretely how each of the books cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovational and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handicraft costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the scene and it is for this reason that she did not shine on the queen".
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two runways on the eve of the coronation.
Although she appeared confident of herself at both shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the "Como en casa" (As at Home) program of the RCN Channel, said the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country’s social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensibility, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects from his butt and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because it is precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the body healthier, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens coach Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him with points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, from the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate from Valle was the surgery she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo was making to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins a year of reign today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the person from Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typist has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a fingerprint scanner from Cali’s CTI went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the FARC Supreme Leader: “Alfonso Cano,” by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint scanners working in the ITC’s local offices, this week it was the “availability” turn of Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the municipalities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of friction skin, i.e., palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because this one was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a pickup and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali typist, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Fingerprinting is an accurate science, with no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprint scanners support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When caught, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had held his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Footprints can also discard or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if that doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the scene.
A CTI typist explained that “fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a pickup or strip is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the delinquents database, or the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the ITC expert said.
He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Since everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
"Indignant" defies New York authorities
Hundreds of demonstrators marched in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities by trying to re-enter Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of demonstrators were huddling in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the "indignant" to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the 'indignant' response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignants' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handed handcuffed.
The organization says there were hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor in front of the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some of the protesters who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time and they were even delivering it to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused “some small clashes,” said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or applying “laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in the Zuccotti square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to hurt other people", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn has been repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than those of American workers," the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they do not plan to hold “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", assistant in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (Baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread broadcast on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, supporting Jesus in a crib.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "slut" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan resurfaced after the earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline from the beginning of March
Since March, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, recovering even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, Japan’s worst disaster since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo estimated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow which, despite the difficult global context, appears to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, gross domestic product data between July and September served to permanently turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the largest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to a decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditures from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan woke up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the turmoil forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, accounted for their poor results between July and September in the yen.
While markets continue to be based in the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
“We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it fell four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Athens rekindles its doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to get entangled in the maze that leads to the exit from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday reported that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he was not going to support any new austerity measures.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a confidence vote for the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, the reform of the Staff Disciplinary Code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has said clearly that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay for the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "preponderant" position in terms of this type of finance
Spain "has reached a place of predominance globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "especially, in the one who has the goal of reducing by half the volume of the dollar to the
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and takes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for women".
We have “achieved many goals” and “we face many challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are emerging from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", His Majesty explained, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought him the qualification of "head of the family" of the reunited Val.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its solidary doors to the contaminated".
CDU proposes to elect European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, was held without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen on the agenda but was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy to be too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes that Angela Merkel was entitled to after their speeches and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile minister of finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - lies in one slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could translate into amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is, in any case, one of the motions adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced the weight of Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty that are quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Sickness Stop Fraud?
After the grants, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save in a context of rigor, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First, for the purpose of budget savings: the government is considering imposing on private employees a fourth day of shortfall before taking charge of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that is likely to provoke anger, but that would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: imposing on civil servants a day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a cessation of work (they do not so far have a period of deficiency, compared to three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will be refunded," Xavier Bertrand told RTL's mic on Sunday.
As in other cases, the advertising effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of stoppage fraud.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
First, let us look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That is 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, the French averaged 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days to a month, 15% one to three months, and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness stop fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sickness stoppages of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically monitored, there were 11% of cases "unsuitable or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little in the face of, for example, that of black work.
According to MEP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in tax shortfall per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to reshape its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos told Parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue our economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papademos predicted that the country’s public deficit would be reduced “around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, on Monday supported measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, from a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
Experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it wants nothing to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, told a conference call yesterday that more cases of these overflows would be found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would help end-of-life people alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
As for those who committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or ceasing patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty of respecting a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts who signed the report "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill people.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he says, “there are beacons and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called “manifest pro-euthanasia.”
In particular, Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Leave Power
Damas denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure has intensified on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, took a position in favor of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country close to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in exchange of fire and pillaging heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not bend,” he added, assuring that “the bearish plots against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he says is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November and including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities affected by the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect,” while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded some time from the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President-elect of the Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a limited list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment by the president was initially hailed by the markets, but the concern rebounded especially after an unexpected drop in industrial output in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should last until 2013, the date of the next legislature, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti committed himself, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim of making Italy "a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for further rigour measures.
The "patron of the bosses" of Italy, Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran’s Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was “seriously concerned” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then co-operated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his country's career on this technology within its military program.
Anti-Muslim Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or little progressed, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in crimes and anti-religious offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"Following a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," Human Rights First said, adding that "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant."
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the organization’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, believing that this could go through an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" make it possible to track the activity of other "Twitters" more clearly, live, the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinct functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated the importance of this innovation through "tweets".
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austro-Hungarian
Inscription of a "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of a large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria on Tuesday decided to include in the constitution a budget "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who himself announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or the United Kingdom.
“If Austria’s solvency was lowered by just one crane, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria is responding to a request from the euro area member countries’ summit in Brussels on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then called for the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value by the end of 2012.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government comes close to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to bring public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of vigor since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, doped by purchases by investors who see it as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This rise in Japanese currency hurts the archipelago's exports because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues derived from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr. Noda said, fearing that the yen's rise would kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister ruled that the cost of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” hinting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), raising the ceiling of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) for purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rates are rising, the stock exchanges are flapping
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions over the yields of euro zone countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilizing,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the line of sight of the markets, as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new record high.
Looking forward to the euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE downgraded the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
And, indeed, it is the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the role of nuclear power.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate disruption, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just wants to build only the latest generation power plants.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a spike in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, all these nasty effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated on.
Europe's champion of wind, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; under which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show principle opposition to this energy, the polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has helped to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly exporting, it brings a galaxy of specialized SMEs into international markets and makes them very job-creating non-delocalizable.
If France decided to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a pity.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years while its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Security Authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing plants as well as over the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and of cooperation between the safety authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to competitors from Areva and EDF by leaving them free to take the lead in the unavoidable development of nuclear.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights country" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
This is because there is a fairly broad consensus between left and right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising almost 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande cites trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent paper synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the impact of migration on the economy.
Restricting immigration anemics growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to take the place of national workers, especially the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly in occupations in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will struggle to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in long-term real wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the US Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (receipts minus expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner possible.
It is known, since Napoleon the Little, that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the true and false Greek referendum has had the value of a double revealer: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organised as necessary and in a dispersed order.
A white-sing to the absolute European monarch or a leap together in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but an exercise, common, full-fledged, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - there is nowhere else to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for the European economic government.
Well, maybe.
But to think it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We need to take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Contactless smart cards are becoming more and more common
The world smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most bearable segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move to higher speeds, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically provide their customers with contactless credit cards in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally see real growth next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further ado.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Axis of Terrorism
The analysis of past calls focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is an advance, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect is receiving financial and intellectual support from outside and is becoming increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated people of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for Sharia law while its militants engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, nuanceless.
The army raided the city, killing 800 people.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claims an attack that kills 80 in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram took over the safe police headquarters in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now of concern to all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, and the Somalis of al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to “share all the information.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplism and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the tone of foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans – often unsupported – are fused.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race to nominate the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese ahead of the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme that is bearing in a America infuriated by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
So much so that it must involve the triggering of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flattens” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capability" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his wine in terms of counter-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his misrepresentations in Libya, thus putting him on a label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The people are rather positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to the embezzlement.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia via the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It has to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on the Baltic coast last Tuesday, between orchestra and buffet, at the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly, under the sea, to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Land.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies there.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has triumphed over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," Fillon confirmed when inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-clad steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“A hundred or so had to be abducted or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to increase measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project officials renounced it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company settle permanently off their coasts.
“In the event of a breakdown, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, carried by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, wide by a meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers accurate information about possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty years renewable, the entire gas transport capacity.
“Gasprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specifics of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour it passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a fragrance of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (mole skin), which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to light an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at the beginning, counts almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city center and has been able to impose her identity.
“We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer cases... The brand has a wide range of media.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouraged?
"No," said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable. "
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled, there are still many obstacles to accessing employment.
They are quite old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the degree and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very prevalent: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work, and that "are the nucleus of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
What remains is the unsaid, the mentalities that are evolving, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of wheelchair users, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the 6% employment target for disabled workers, set in a 1987 law.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go as far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the national team, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I need to get my marks.”
Made against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Not to mention the notion of “pleasure.”
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a supporter,” he says.
Of course, this helps to further strengthen the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he rappels.
"We just crossed paths."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens, for his part, referred to "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala game".
"Proud" also to note -as a "neighbor" - that France is "received a very high-level team" just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a thunder job," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see himself share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be aware of it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism his dam back against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the end, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is in fact only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to knock out.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but he was unable to score such a valuable goal, which would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home, in their luminous Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there also boiling, even if the party announces itself obviously "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We are expecting a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The zero reported on Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One zero can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal outside," Bento said.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and that has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible so as not to "give them time to think."
It’s a good idea, provided it’s realistic this time.
