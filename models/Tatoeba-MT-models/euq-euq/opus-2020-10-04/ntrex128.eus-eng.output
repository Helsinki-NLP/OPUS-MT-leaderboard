The members of Wales have made their concerns because they're gonna take him as a "school."
Some of the members of the Bazor have shown an unpleasantness to change their rank as MWP (after hearing the suggestion of changing it as a member of the Government of Gales).
This idea has been created after the union of Wales to change its plans.
The members of the political assembly are worried that this plan is a good way to mock them.
A member of the laborary party in the assembly said: "Eingelesez, Twp and Pwp rhymes rhyme this new name."
If you're outside of Wales, it means the word twp is "stop" and the word pwp means "cake".
For his part, a member of Scotland has said that the whole group is not "very happy" and has suggested to search for the names of the replacements.
Even a member of the conservative part of Wales said that he was open to the new ideas of changing the name, but also his concern has been given by the rims which MWP can produce changes.
In order to make this conflict better understand, it must be observed that the w letters of Wales and the English uds of Yorkshire have the same tone.
Now the commissions of the assembly, which are becoming a legal draft to make change of names, say, "As for the members of the Union, they will have the only care to choose the descriptions which they wish to use."
According to the 2017 acre of the Gales government, the meeting of Wales has the power to change its name.
In June, the Comissius published the results of a public query to choose the proposals suggested, and in general the great business of Wales received many statements of union.
In regard to the names of the members of the Union, the Commissioner or the Cold of the Wales Government, he chose the name WMP (in the Singelese Sigle), but the name MWP was decided on a public query.
The members of the Union suggest alternative options, but it may be extremely difficult to choose an opportunity with a mouth, especially for the Presidents of the Union, Elin Jones, who has had to send a few weeks to change.
However, the laws of the changes which are made will affect the work of the assembly; others, to avoid the activities of which the members of the Union would lose good names, will arise, and the layout of the assembly will be handled by the help of this law.
When they dispute the change of law, the members of the Union will choose to decide upon their names.
The Macedonians will take part in a referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether they will change the name of the country as the Republic of Macedonia.
It is settled that the whole population should be able to repair the long tenads of the last decades with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia).
The government of Athens has long ago remarked that the name of the neighbouring in the North is a revisitation of its country, and has once prevented the request of the European Union and NATOn.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanove, who is the opponent of the plebisa to change his name, says he will not see the vote.
However, the followers of the Referendum (the first minister including Zaev) say that the price is only to pay for EBan and NATOn.
The bells of the San Martin Church lose their voice for trouble with the churches of Harlem.
"I've talked to so many older people, and they say you could find a bar and a church in every corner of it," says Mr. Adams.
Now there's nothing."
He says the disappearance of Tabern is normal.
"The people use other methods to socialize," explains.
"The Taberns are no longer the neighbouring living-rooms used to join people."
As to the clergy, it is concerned that the money obtained for the assets will not be enough, and that we shall be again at the first or later.
The churches may also be replaced with houses, and the temples of the neighbouring will be built by persons who do not care.
"The people who buy homes of society will be white people," says he, "and therefore the churches will be fast shut down because this new people are not members of the churches."
The congregations of white people built these two churches before Harlem was a black metropolis; it was a unit of Metropoli, 1870, and they built a San Martin later decade.
In 1930 he went out of the neighborhood to the original medical congregation congregation.
After that, the receptivity was taken by a congregation of black people.
Reverendo John Howard Johnson's black congregation took the San Martin church, Howard arranged a boict against the 125 commercial streets of Harlem, which didn't hire or climb black people.
After a fire that had been in 1939, the church had had a great deal of harm, but Father Johnson's churches designed many plans to build the church and collect the carilloy.
Reverendo David Johnson, father Johnson's son, and San Martin's heir, called the driver the bells of the poor people.
The expert who struck the carilloy in July gave him another name, "The treasure of culture" and "inconceivable historical intrusion."
Age, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, has also remarked that the first carilloy of a black musician has been the first of all the world, the musicians, Dionisio A. Lindek, who had gone to play a greater carillo of Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather explains that San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In the last few months, St. Martin saw some of them who had been brought by the laic leaders or bishop-dios.
The meetings of Pawry (the articulator of articulators), moreover, the contracting of those persons who had sent a letter to the July to make sure that "the costs of the past would pass to the parish," because the parish has no concern with the architects and counter-tractists sent him.
Some of the churches present their complaints for the lack of transparency that the dues had.

The plans of Sainsbury's supermerceited enters the American market of the United States
Sainsbury's supermercial supervisor has taken Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the shops, and now presents lots of beauties with various expert and specialized workers.
As long as the sales of Mod and home produce are diminished, 2,8,000 francs are invested in the sector of the beauty of the United Kingdom, which is increasing indefinitely, they will be built greater numbers of beauty, and will be tried in the eleven shops of the country. If it is good results, they will open up more shops in the next year.
Thanks to the investments in beauty, the television, the microuhin labs, and the departments that sold home products can be taken by supermercials.
According to Sainsbury's supermercepts, he will double the offer of their beauty and offer more than 3000 products, Revlon, Esie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and the similar marks of customers.
As for the L'Oreal, maybelline and Burt's Bees marks, they'll have more space in branded fields like the fields that can be found in Boots stores.

Besides, Fragrance Shop will test the fruit dealers offered in the two shops of the Sainsbury's supermarket, the first in the week on the south side of Croydon, the second in Selly Oak (Birmingham) will open at the end of the year.
In the online shops, and every day in the small stores, they are apt to buy food, and supermercials must work their minds and ears to attract the clients.
Mike Coupe, master of the Sainsbury's supermarket, said the sales points will take a style of great salvation and that the supermercial chain will at times diminish the threat of the competitors and the produce that are not the food.
Sainsbury's supermerged ones opened Argos's trade points in hundreds of sales stores, and has opened many Habitats, after he has bought two chains a couple of years ago, and that is to say, the food sale has been strengthened, and the chains that he bought are more useful than ever.
The supermarked tried to reopen the series of beauty and medicine, but the strategy failed.
Then he met Sainsbury's Boots at the beginning of the 2000 year, but this association was over because the profits that he had been won in the shops of the supermergeds had been turned to burn paper.
A new strategy was arranged by Sainsbury's supermarket, when he sold the medicine scene in his 281 shops to Celesio, who is the master of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago because of 125 million libes.
The Lloyds chain will have a function in the scheduled plan. It will add a large set of luxury to watch the cover in four shops; others, La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarket, said, "We've improved the appearance of manners so our customers can find a better environment.
We've also hired high experience workers to provide detailed advice about the products.
We have designed our Market to fill all our demands and, thanks to commodities and commodities, our series of beauty offers a general and easy opportunity before those who use the old methods."

Dragons Den program star, Peter Jones "frequent," went by Holly Willoughby the television agent, after leaving off the 11 million francs offer of his life-marking, after he was about to give a full interest in the new contracts with Mark and Spencer and ITV enpress.

The match business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The presentationer from the program this morning used to present his resignation.
Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept the contracts offered by Marks and Spencer and ITV enpres, Dragons' program star on Den, Peter Jones was very angry at the last time to leave the big profiting business between them.

The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and has doubled Willoughby's 11 million francs good.
Willoughby, after 37, having pointed out at Instagram, left Truly's business, left Jones out of the United Kingdom to go to a vacation house.
One of the sources said, "This chance has always been between Holly's prioritys.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be confirmed.
However, the decision to give us the mark, has left us with a full mouth.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, but when the mark was about to close it.
Still, Marlowe's office's store is full of products to sell."
According to experts, the company is about to lose millions of francs because of going to the exhibition of the program this morning (which is the most opulent present of the United Kingdom), the company has invested a lot of money in various products (otherly, quaxines, candles, clothes, and products of the house), and is now to be confronted by the delays which can be created.
Besides, this conflict may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have three children, and Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, have been a bad friend for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappe created the Truly mark in 2016 and Jones entered March as director 52.
Two couples always get together their vacations and a 40 percent of the Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby M&S is the ambassador of the mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as an exhibition from the ITV channel A Celebrity.

That's a bad conversation, but then we're "reloved"
He was joking about the wrong remarks he had to bear because of the media, about the leader of North Korea.
Why did the President Trump get so many things?
Trump has used his "developer's voice" to reply to his jackets:
"I didn't give anything."
After the first meeting done in June Singapore, Kim said that Mr. Trump wants to arrange a second meeting and, thanks to that, it's a very important step on the way to the nuclear armor of North Korea.
However, the process of nuclear disarm has stopped.
After the meeting and three months in Singapore, the principal diplomatist of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said to the leaders of the world of NBE, in the general assembly of Saturday, the North Korea has not seen the "responsible answers" in the United States of the United States in regard to the steps of the nuclear disarming.
Instead, the Punishments established by the United States have been hardened to preserve the country.
Trump has a more optimistic view, and so expressed in the last speech.
'The relationships we have with North Korea are better than ever,' he said.
"Besides, we were to declare war with North Korea."
This war could kill millions of people.
But now we have this extraordinary relation between our hands."
Besides, he said that his efforts to improve his relations had brought good results; the other trials made with misils have finished, the release process has been improved, and the retarding of the rest of the United States is started.
It also explains its unusual point of view of conversations with Kim.
"It's very easy for the President's work, but instead of having a hundred thousand people in the country, we've got 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to his personal stocking.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes have destroyed an island, and have been killed by hundreds of them.
After the earthquake of Lombok, for instance, there was no need for the uninhabited organizations to win internationally.
Although the ten percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had been shifted, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (the preliminary conditions to ask for the help of thenas).
"In so many cases, in fact, the government plainly said that it was not necessary for international assistance, so it is a challenge," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Kids organization is forming a group that goes to Palu, but the volunteers still don't know they can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, the representative of the national defeats, according to what he said, the Indonesian officers are working in Palun to allow the help of international agents.
Though the Indonesia has suffered so many earthquakes, the country has subdued measures to resist the rage of nature.
The forts of the Tsunamis have been built by Aceah, but there are still too few for the coast.
Palu hasn't got any siren to warn you, and even though the warning starts, perhaps so many dead people are dead.
When the weather is good, traveling among the Indonesian Islands may be a challenge.
Besides, natural disasters make them difficult to inplement the logistics.
To give the victims of the earthquake a hospital receptive was anchored at Lombok, and now he's going to Palu, but he'll need at least three days to get to the place of the disaster.
The President Widodo campaign was founded on projects to improve the substructions of Indonesia, and has introduced a lot of money to improve the roads and the railway.
However, the funds are reduced, and the administration of the President of the Game is in trouble while the election of the year comes.
In the same way, Mr. Game is in trouble to control the sects of the Indonesium, for example, most of the members of the Islamian party have taken a more conservative point of religion.
Thus, more than 1000 people have died, and the tennas have lost thousands of their houses because the bands of the Christians and the Islamians have carried their battles into the streets; the others use the maches, the bows, the arrows, and the like weapons.

The position of Cromwell in Parlament becomes the final goal of reopening history.
If it disappears, justice will be poetical, as Taliban had destroyed so many religious objects, with the historical and cultures of the country that the fanatic fanatics of England did the same.
The Cromwell association, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "indecent" and that he's trying to reiterate his history.
John Goldsmith, the Cromwell Consultor of the Cromwell, said, "Oliver Cromwell, who are outside of the Palace, is an inevitable dispute, that is to say, the State of Oliver Cromwell;
Cromwell has never asked or organized civil wars in England.
Maybe we should sacrifice another Cromwell to his ancestors, Thomas, for the actions he had done in the past.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing representation of Cromwell, is part of the opinion of the 19th century and of our own history;
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph, "The less people think this, than in the 19th century, but many people still think that it was a defendant of the Parliament against foreign pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about monarchy.
The substance of historical discussions will remain, whether it is the exact representation of that person.
However, we may safely say that the conflict had occurred in the midst of the 17th century was the starting-point of the development of our country, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties that parted in this starting-point.
The title of the title of "Lord Protector" may be the reason for celebrated and remembering all its achievements.
A pig kills a peasant in China
A pig attacked a farmer and killed him on a southwest market in China according to the media of the place.
The man with the name Yuan was found dead, his body had a cut-up artery, and was wet in blood in a roulette of the provincial Liupanshue market, South China Morning Post newspapers, according to the one specified on Sunday.

Normally, on Wednesdays, Yunnan travels from the provinces to sell his cousin 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found the body of the dead man and saw that the door of the neighbouring pighouse was open.
He also declared that there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.

According to security camera recordings, Yuan can see how you go in the market at 4:40 o'clock in the morning to feed pigs.
They found her body one hour later.
The animal that killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin's urds.
According to what one of the principal markets said to the Evening News newspaper, the pig is locked up to avoid more attacks and to let the police collect the evidence of the place.
The leaders of Yuan's family and market are negotiating for his death.
Although weird, some pigs' attacks have been registered before.

Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 francs surrounded a countryman of Wales in his tractor until the wife of man was driven away by the animal.

The little storms of Rosa Urakan will leave rain showers in the Southwest of the United States
According to the weather, Rosa is weakening the waterfall while he goes to the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring rain showers in the North of Mexico and South West of the United States.
In the 5:00 of the morning, Rosa will create a 85 miles an hour, and it will be converted into the water of the category 1, according to the east hour, on Sunday, from the southwest-western Punta of Mexico to 385 miles.
So, on Sunday, it's expected to go north of Rosa.
In the meantime, a point of lower progress is coming to the Western coasts of the Ocean and to the east of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja California's penintsula will be turned into tropical storm and will lead the tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Besides, on Monday, Rosa will bring rain 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity will be combined with the point of the lower division, and great rainbows will be produced in the days that come in the southwest.
In the places of the place, 1-4 inches of dangerous water can be all floods, streams of ruins, and land-pipes in the desert.
The rains created by great tropical moisture can leave 2-3 inch in exact places, especially in Nevada and the souths of Arizona.
It's expected in South West 2-4 inch to collect water, especially in Arizona.
As the tropical rains are vagabonds, they may create sudden floods and municipal conditions.
It is not recommended that we should walk into the wilderness if a storm's warning was given.
The rainbows can make rocks strong streams, and storms can bring winds and dust.
Besides, the pressure will descend, the rain showers of the place will be on the southern coasts of California.
It's raining and it's half-in-a-inch water that can be gathered, and it's possible to create small junk streams and slippery roads.
This may be the first rainfall of the rainy season of the region.
Even on Sundays and Mondays there can be a few scattered tropical rains in Arizona, but there will be more rainfalls on Monday and Tuesday.
Tuesday rain showers will go to four corners and disappear until Wednesday.
October can have a strong change of temperature in the United States as the artic countries are cooled, but the temperatures of the tropicals will be preserved.
Sometimes these temperatures have great changes in short distances.
As an example, there will be great change of temperature in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha among the Nebraska cities and St. Louis Moines (Iowa) cities.
The next day the warmth of summer will be reached and will spread everywhere.
The Middle and East of the United States will have a little warmness; the temperatures of 80 degrees will be the northeasteast of the south plains.

More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's statement.
More than 20 million people saw in the six-way news of Tuesday, Brett Kavanaugh, and Christine Blasey Ford's wonders, the latter accused Kavanaugh for sexual abuses that he had suffered during 1980.
In the meantime, the political conflict was continued, and the exhibitors of the channels interrupted Friday's final program for the last minute to give an announcement, the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake agreed to make a week's investigation with the FBI.
According to what Ford had said to the Senate's magistrate, it is quite certain that Kavanaugh touched him again and again while he was drunk and tried to remove his clothes in a high school party.
For Kavanaugh, he said in a passionate declaration that he was quite certain that it didn't happen.
According to the date of Niels, it was only about 20.4 million people who had opened the statement on Friday.
The company calculated the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC views.
However, this number was not immediately available for other channels, but also PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has a problem counting people who see TV in offices.
To be an example, we can say the number of spectators can compare with a football final, or the Academy's rewards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's declaration is highly acceptable to the exhibitors of the channel, and above all, while he was making a statement of five,69 millions of spectators, Nielsen said.
The second ABC was with three,26 million people.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC got 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million, and CNNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
After listening to the declaration, the public interest remained.
It was Flake Friday's drama.
When the office of moderate republican party had been announced to be voted for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNNN and CBS were recorded by Kavanaugh on Friday while he was trying to take a elevator and declare it in the Magistrate.
He saw directly on the CNN channel that his gaze went down as the public quarrelled.
"I am here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have a very great power, but many women have nothing."
Before he shut the elevator and the elevator door, Flak said that his office had published a notification and will give him more details in the meeting.
The strings on the cable and the TV were sending him directly and while the Magistrater was voted to be a Senator Kavanaugh.
Yet Flak said he would vote after a week's examination of the argument against the FBI against the candidate, remember that he was asking him to do such a democrata of minority.
After talking to his friend, the democrator Chris Coons, Flake almost believed in the investigation.
After speaking to Coons and several senators, Flak made his final decision.
Flak's decision was powerful, because the Republican party doesn't have enough votes to admit Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to examine the arguments that are against Kavanaugh.

Before the anniversary of voted for Independence between the police and the independent of the Catalian.
Six people have been arrested on this Saturday in Barcelona to remember the first anniversary of the elections that had been voted for injunction with the war with the police against independence.
The police against the riot stopped a group of independentists disguised, but they threw their eggs and painting dust, which resulted in the streets of the tourists.
More fights arose later to stop the quarrels because the police were using their fights.
Even the groups of independence had spent several hours, 'We won't forget, we won't forgive 'em' in front of the unionists, who were singing 'Lots of life to the Spanish.'
According to what the reporters of the place received fourteen people's treatment for the small wounds received in quarrels.
There is a great nervousness in the country where the elections of October were made in this country where they were seeking to find independence, which were illegal according to the government of Madrid, but the independent of the Catalians obtained a day to celebrate.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but the share of the people was very small for the number of citizens who wanted to vote the election.
According to the rulers of the Catalian, they were wounded after the assault of the police, because they went to the places where the election had been voted to stop the voters, and therefore there were violent quarrels.
Groups for independence are camped on Friday to avoid a march for the national police.
The march was done, but they forced him to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is electronic, and he went with his wife to express his independence, and said that Katalunia has no hope of obtaining independence.
"We had a wonderful moment last year.
My parents were glad they could vote, but now we're stuck."
When the last local elections have gained a considerable but important victory, the catalants of independence have had a great deal of trouble to maintain the interest of the people this year; they are either exiled or arrested by the leadership of parties, and are now waiting for a trial to declare independence.
Go to Puig, 42-year-old mechanic is filming the march for the police on his phone and the politicians of both parties say they're guilty of this situation.
"There's more tension and health," he said.
On Saturday, an Oriol Junqueras, one of the Katalunian leaders, who waited for the trial in prison for the next year in the election of the European Parliament.

Thanks to the shooters of the Meng, Livingston earns 1-0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Meng's first goal confirmed to the time of Livingston.
Livingston, raised up by level, impressed by the Rangers player and Steven Warrd gets his second defeat as the leader of the Ibrox club at 18 Partids.
Dolly Meng's shot was decided that the group of Hibernian in Gary Holt was rising on the second part.
This period of Premiership remains unintentional in the Warrd Group, and against the leader of Parts (which have eight extra points) on the next Sunday.
Before this game, Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vienna on Tuesday in Europe.
In the meantime, the Livingston team isn't defeated and six games are left for this period, and the Hot Trainer doesn't know what the failure is since he replaced Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston loses various chances in front of strong visitors
The group of Holts had to stand before he came into the gorilla, and because he had a great justice, he caused a great deal of trouble to join the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way, but all his efforts had been lost in front of the door, and then Alan Lithgow had turned his efforts to the door after the head of Craig Halkett's head.
They talked about letting the host play Rangers, but they knew they were bothered.
And it was with that mood that came the decisive goal.
Rangers had given a free shot and Livingston had created an opening to mark the Menga, Declan Gallagher, and Robinson combined together, but this one touched the ball in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the game the Rangers took possession of the Rangers, but it was an indirect defence of the house, and Liam Kelly had passed the match without trouble.
This pattern followed as far as the second part, but Alfredo Morelos's shot asked for the full skill of Kelly.
Scott Pittman couldn't mark the gola for Allan McGregor's concierge and Lithgow avoided the other move in Livingstone.
The Pass went up and down in the Livingston area and went out again and again, two players called for penalty, Halkettes disfigured the delegate in Glenn Middleton, and the other two turned aside because of touching the ball with his hand.
Livingston's "mindible" game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of Scotland, Tony Macaroni of A
Livingston's game has been excellent and perfect.
They've made special roles for me, and they've got a lot of good chances to climb up the steps.
The style of playing and group has not been changed since they reached the first level, but Holt has been a special trainer: the team has been set straight since it came.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halkett's job was terrible. He's got an excellent defence and he's taken care of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
Rangers hadn't much inspiration, though.
They work very well when they're at warrd's orders, but the trainers have forgotten the standards set.
The last move has been too weak, and they have been defeated only once in the defence of homes, and the Rangers must walk fast if they want to get out of the board.

Rosa has become a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (possibly of the dryest zones to get some benefits)
It's very strange to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but that's what happens the next week while the Urakan Rosa exhausts its strength; it will visit the Southwest desert, and it's risking to be sudden floods.
The national weather service has already sent a warning about Monday and the sudden floods that can be created on Friday, and it will go from Arizona west to south and east of Nevada and south-east of California and Utah, others from Phoenix, Flags, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be Monday will show his arrival.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has written this in a gutter of "1950, ten tropical cycles produced by Phoenix 200 miles from Phoenix have kept the state of tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was the waterman from AZ to 40 miles.'
According to the latest prediction of the national center of the Urakan, 2-4 inches will be gathered together water, and at the edge of the Arizona Mogollon there will be about six inches of water gathered together.
As for other areas in the Southwest of the Basamor, the Rocky Mountains and the Great Rocks in the middle, the 1-2 inch of water will be gathered together; in isolated places four inches will be gathered up.
As for those who expect by sudden floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing for those who have suffered the lands.
The floods must not be diminished, but these rainbows may be useful for dry landing in Southwest.
According to the service to controlling lands in the United States, the 40 critical per cent of Arizona is suffering, which is the highest category, stated the weather.com sites.
First, the road to Rosa the urakan will pass through the peninsula of the Baja Californa of Mexico.
Rosa will keep the strength of the urakan on Sunday morning, and the wind will produce at most 85 miles an hour; it will be on the south side of Mexico to 385 miles, and will have a speed of 12 miles/hour.
The storm is finding some colder water in the Pacific, and consequently its power is weakening.
Thus, on Monday afternoon or night, Mexico will come to Mexico as a tropical storm.
Because there are some places in Mexico that can be storms, there is a great storm of floods.
The weather.com according to the site, "euri-zapards leave 3-6 inches water from Baja California to Sonora southwest, and there may be 10 inches to collect."
Then Rosa will pass as a tropical storm from the north of Mexico to the border of Arizona as a tropical depression in the mornings of Tuesday, then he will cross Arizona and go to Utah for Tuesday.
"The greatest threats of the Ros or of his storms in Baja California are the hard storms which will arise in the northwest of Sono in the Southwest and in the United States," said the national center.
These rains will be produced by dangerous floods and ruins in the deserts and the earth-birds on the mountains.

Nugroho says, "Tsunamia dragged the cars, the trunks and the houses, and destroyed everything in the country," even more than the tsunami has traveled from open sea at 800 km/h speed (497 m/h) before it reached the coast.
"So many persons have gone up to the trees to escape from tsunami and survived," said the delegate.
Especially 16.700 people have gone to the Pallo 24 cents.
A series of buildings and stores destroyed, a ruined bridge, and a massequet surrounded by water, may be seen in the airtic photographs taken up by the agents against the ruins.

In certain victims the bodies have been found among the remains of the destructive buildings, and consequently the 540s are more wounded, and 29 people have disappeared.
Even Nugroho said that the number of victims and the disaster could increase along the coast of the Palun 190 miles, especially a place called Donggala, which is near the epicentre.
The Donggala Communications don't work and we don't have any information," Nugroho declared.

A few minutes later he arrives on the shore of the waterhound and drags the buildings and the cars.

Following the Indonesian law, it can only begin after classing international financialisation, supplies, and workers' provisions as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still the ruin of the province," says Aulia Arriani, "the speaker of the Red Indonesian Cross.

US should double the AA financialisation
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the number of it that the United States uses to investigate in this field ought to be duplicated by the comprehension of Kai-Fu Lee invested and AAn expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were created when several parts of the government of the United States had made several notifications about AI, though the United States had no official AI strategy in general.
In the meantime, China's plan last year, its goal is to become the best of the AI in renovation for 2030.
"It would be a good beginning to double the research, for other countries are far from America and seek the next discovery of the AI," said Leek.
Double-produce in America can double the possibility of making great AA discoveries, Lee told CNBC in a conversation this week.
This month, which Leek has published the book of China, Silicon Valley, and New World Order, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the main director of Sinovation Ventures, who has studied in one of the important companies of the Chinese AI, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AA System on the top-level Othello player in America, and then he worked executives in Microsoft Research, and was the president of Google in the Chinese field.
Leek praised the precedent technology contests of the United States, and he asked if the intervention of the progressive Agentship of other Defensive Projects would be the next time he would be able to identify the next dreamer.
The US investigators must often work to get the government funds, says Leek.
"It doesn't mean China takes the Academic leaders, they're companies," Leek added.
Facebook, Google and many other technology companies have taken the most brightest of the colleges to act on AI for the last few years.
Leek said altering immigration policy would help the United States to encourage the AI's performances.
'I think they'd be going to offer green tickets to the AI doctors,' he remarked.
The Council of China in July 2017 brought out the Plant of the following generation of Artificle Insurrection.
The Fundation of the natural science of China, as the National Science Fundation and other Government institutions finance the people of the academic institutions in America, but in China the quality of academic work is less than the quality of the academic work, says Leek.
This year, before the United States Defense of Defense, created an Artificle Intelligence Centro, where the members of industry and education were gathered together, and the White House informed him that he formed the Committee of Artificle Insurance.
And this month, DARPA reports about 2 billion investment in the institute of the AI.
Like for NSF, he invests more than $100 million a day in AA's research year.
In the meantime, the E.B. Lawyer who designed to form the Security Committee of the National Artificial Intelligence, had no advance in the last months.
In order to determine whether the Macedonians had changed the name of the country.
The country of Macedonia voted by referendum on Sunday to determine whether to change the name of the ancient republic of Meazedonia.
Greece, who formerly had a province called Macedonia, still takes the name of the inhabitants of the north, and blockes the opportunity of entering NATOn and EBn.
The governments of the two countries came to an agreement in the State, based on the new name proposed, but the nationalists say that this change is due to the prejudice of most of the inhabitants of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanove declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boicte hesitated to be valid about whether 50 percent should be obtained in the editor's view.
This is the question that might be read in the Referendum's paper, "Are you on behalf of NATO and EB partnership with the Greek agreement?"
Those who are in favour of changing their name, including Zaev the Prime Minister, say that it is worth the chance of getting into EB and NATO institutions for Macedonia, where Yugoslavia is one of those countries created when it was destroyed.
"I have come to speak about the future of the country, to the young men of Macedonia, because under the roof of Europe the Union will bring us more safe life," declared Olivera Georgijevsk, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it's not legally a lottery, they've declared that enough members in parliament will follow the result of vote to be decided.
The three third-thirds of parliament will be required to change their name.
The committee of State selection declared that there was no report of surprise until about one o'clock.
However, he voted only 16 percent, on the 34 percent of the last elections of 2016, in which the 66 percent of the people who had the right to vote was voted.
"I went to vote for my children, where our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, capital, Skopje.
The first minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushkok, changed the name of the country in the reign of Macedonia, and might be able to enter NATOn and European Union in Strumican, Macedonia, September 30th, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old, there was a small stage and a ladder up in front of everyone who wanted to boicate the editor.
'We're on the side of NATO and EB, but we want to meet with our own conditions and not the servants' door,' said Kavadarkove.
"We are poor country, but we have some dignity.
If we don't want Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the union of Euro-Asia."
Zaev the Prime Minister says that the friend NATO can bring in the Macedonia aversion so necessary that unworking is about 20 percent.
"I think it's going to be the majority, because it's more than 80 percent of the citizens for EB and NATO," said Zaev after he had voted.
When he said "yes" would confirm our future.
The past Monday according to the inkest published for the Macedonian Politic Research, he would take part in the voters over 30 and 43 percent in the voters, less than necessary.
Another incoherent, the Telma TV of Macedonia, said that the 57 percent of the Niilians had been voted on Sunday.
From these he declared that 70 percent would throw him away.
For the referendum successful, 50 plus a vote has to be removed.
If there was a mistake in the Referendum, it would be the first fatal error of the policy for the West, since it had begun almost in May.

When the actibists at the moment of my place voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
Because I'm the last one that we didn't welcome from the Laborist's MPs to say what we thought.
I have a member of the Parliament, John Ryan also received a similar treatment because he spoke for antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship made me criticize that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, in the security of the nation, in Europe, with the leaders of Jeremy, he did not agree in the same matters as he did before.
The news about the meeting in the East Nottingham Friday said, "We want the investors and producesives to be meetings."
This is the eight years I've been carrying as a Laborist's MP in town, the GC meetings on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, politics never remembered the word "worm, respectful," if it had ever been.
It remains that there are different views in the laborious party, and the opinions are admitted or not allowed to the leaders of the party.
This was started when Jeremy became a leader, when the members of the same political views had turned round 180 degrees, and I would never have consented to accept the views, as well as the only markets of the nation.
Every time I spoke in public, it doesn't matter what I said.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have better luck than some of my fellow-citizens, because the opinions I have thrown against me are political.
Every day I am subject to those who are to be faced with professionalism and honesty to sexualism or raciality.
It is one of the unpleasant aspects of the political of this time that it is supposed to be a normal level of persecution.
Jeremy Corbyn, declared that the Laborist party should suscept the culture of Tolerance in the past week.
In fact, we don't get the only opinion when the "developance" in every mocium or the rules of the party become narrower.
For the last two years, I've had so many notes to go down, not to talk so much, and say, "I'd be too good."
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I was driven by the carelessness of the government of Thatcher to abandon the room, and entered the public services which were most necessary to me-a minister of the local counselors or government.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
None of the Oriental Nottingham will doubt about my political point of view and my present leaderships.
I would say to those who sued the motition of Friday when the country is turning to our homes, our business, and the public services, I don't understand how much time and energy will hurt me.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to my electors, whether it be part of the laborist party, I am very proud of working for you, and I promise you to follow what is best for your interests, and to avoid threats or threats from political experiments.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is a leader who has not yet lost a game.
The last two trials of surprise changed the final result somehow, but no doubt Ayr deserved the victory at the play of the day of the wonderful and fun of the Tennent Series.
They're on the first stage of the table, and they're the only ones who haven't lost a ten.
At the end, they had a better defence, and the chances were better taken, and the house and the trainer Peter Murchie have the right to be happy.
"We've been tested till now, and we haven't lost one, so we have to be happy."
And Christie of Melrose said, "My honors to Ayr, the choices which were better used than we did."
In the 14th minute of the Anderson, Frazier Climo, before Ayr, the yellow card from Captain Rory Hughes, left by Warriors to play, allowed to add points to Melrosi and Jason Baggot to make trial.
Climo blocked the leader of Ayr by penalty. Before he had finished the first part, he made the experiment alone and went to rest at 17-5 Ayr.
But Melrose began in the second part, and Patrick Anderson' trial, Baggot made the difference five points.
Then there was a long pause because of the serious lesson of Ruaridh Knott player, which had been brought out on the tip of his hand, and when he came back to the game, he turned the rest of the Stafford McDowall into Climok.
Then they took out the yellow card to Captain Blair Macpherson Ayr, and Melros took advantage of a man, who was not able to make a living end of Bruce Colvine.
The house came back, and when Hutchinsoni had brought out the yellow card in the Struan, to hinder the fact that Climo had no bulleto, MacPherson went forward and touched the ground behind the screen of the Ayr.
Climo missed him, as he had done almost from the beginning, as Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's kick and kicked Gregor Henry out of his wing in the fifth trial of the house.
Still the serial game star will start a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the actor ford Kiran wants to jump into the world of the host, because he is aware that they have named the director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the famous view of BBC, together with Greg Hemphill that has been a writer and a star.
The couple announced that the course of the show will be the first time, nineth, and it seems that the life after Kiernan Craiglang is planning.
According to the official records, Adriftmorn is the director of Mugaed.
The actor didn't want to explain anything about the story, though the Scottish Sun magazine had said that he wanted to put it into a "mark of the most important houses" in Kiernan Glasgow."
"The sea is ours": the internal Bolivia expects the courts to reopen the path to the East
The main seat of the seaman patrol carrots, La Pazen.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca, on the bases of the Amazon ships, the following fool may be read, "The sea is ours by right.
To restore it is our duty."
During the Bolivia of the Barneland, the XIXth century of many blood spills still continues to live the Colts of the Chile, for they still want to go back to sea in the Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps stronger now than in the last decades, because Bolivia expects us to take away international courts after five years of October.
"Bolivia lives the right moment with the sense of union and quiet, and of course he is waiting for the result," says Roberto Calzadill, diplomatic Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will continue the decision of the international court throughout the country, because the Hagako Court will give reason to the demands of Bolivia-after the negotiations which the decades have lasted-that is to say, that they have been forced to negotiate about the sovereign road to Bolivia on the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigential President of Bolivia, who has made several contributions about Monday's solutions that are involved in the conflict of having to be selected again the next year.
"We are very close to return to the Ocean," he said, at the end of the August.
Sometimes some of the analists think that the court will not decide on Bolivia, and consequently not change much.
The organization of the United Nations situated in the Netherlands has no power to give the Chile country, and has declared that it will not be decided about the results of the negotiations that may be placed.
"Not difficult," said Pazrate, "in international law of Chile.
And the cause of Bolivia was susceptible for the last four years.
'The subject of coming to the sea has taken the present Boliviar administration as a prisoner,' said Zarate.
President Morales's beligerant rhetoric has spoiled all the desire to do what was left of Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Txile must still play many different topics, but it will be very difficult to discuss after it.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Edwardus Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia Hagan, is not agreed to those who say that the court resolution is particularly clever.
On Monday, Bolivia said, "She'll have a great opportunity to reset her relations to Chile" and "to finish 139 years of dissension, for their good."
Calzadill said that Morales still didn't agree with one of the popular presidents of South America who say he's using the business of the sea for political assistance.
"Bolivia will never refuse the right to reach the Ocean," he added.
"It's the chance we had to see for the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarm will not happen until he can believe in America.
The North Korea Minister, Ri Yong Ho says his country isn't disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
That's what Rik declared in front of the General Batzar of the United Nations.
He asked the United States on the top of Singapore to fill up the word given by the leaders of the enemies.
He said that Mike Pompeo is a secretary of the United States to the North Korea of Kim Jong Un for three months more than three months to block the nuclear diplomacy again.
Rik says that "utopia" is the continued sentence, and that the U.S. objections of America will be placed at its feet in front of the end of Korea.
Washington doesn't want to agree to the confession before Pyongyang can take his weapons off.
Yes, yes, the president of the United States wants to go to the second peak.
But there is a great scepticism about Pyongyang that the country seems to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
The idea of Pompeus is to go to Pyongyang on the next month to organise Kim and Trump.
In the fashion of Paris, he has shown the latest line of bulk caps on High Street beside you.
If you want to increase the collection of your caps or you want to block the sun, here's the answer.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of curious caps of large sizes in the collection of springs of 2019, which made him tremble in the week of the Paris Moda.
Instagram and these designers have reached the passage where they have not been practical in this summer.
The most remarkable piece of Valentino, with a smooth-coloured hat-like wings, covered the models' heads.
We have amongst other features of great size, a kind of an ants full of jewelry, a rather rare hat, and a sort of pina-but they are not designs to warm our heads.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have lips full and Hannibal Lecter's looks as though they were high tailors.
One looked like a scarf mask with glasses and tubes, while another was watered ice cream cuckoo.
If you're Moda's follower, you have good news.
The style experts say gorrels are going to get out of the street, even to your neighbours.
Big-sized caps come after the 'La Bomba', the straw hat of two feet, started from Rihanna, and we saw a lot of famous people in Emily Ratajkowski.
The high-mark behind a hat that has not been successful in social networks has led another object into the passage - the straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model in the bathing suit.
The orange-colored gold bag, cut off with pefire lits and had finished with the white leather handle of Jacquemus's La Riviera 2019 spring-udad in Paris Mod's week.
The stilist Luke Armitage celebritien said in FEMAIL, "I hope that the big hat and the big bags for the beach should come to the main streets next summer, with the great echo of the designer would be difficult to ignore the request of giant features."
John Edward: Basic language capability for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland make records of the academic perfection, and have continued in 2018 with the extraordinary results of study, which have been strengthened in sports, amongst which they have obtained in music and community.
With the 3,000 students across Scotland, these schools, the Scottish Council being represented by the Independent Schools (SCIS), the Councils of Independent Schools, and the best service between students and their parents.
The end of independent schools is for high education, to prepare them for a chosen career, and as a citizen.
As an educational sector, we can design and implement the custom curriculum of school, we have seen that modern languages follow the usual choice of the students.
And Nelson Mandel said to himself, "If you speak in a language that understands someone, you will come to his head.
But if you speak in his language, you will come to his heart."
It is a strong way to construct relations with people in other countries, and to gain confidence in them, that we ought not only to use English to remind them of it.
We can see from the results of the final examinations of the year, that there are languages in the upper parts of the most transcendent independent schools.
68 percent of the students who learn foreign languages has acquired the best classification A.
Data, gathered up in school 74 of SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students had achieved the best classification in the Chinese Mandarie; 72k German per cent, 69k in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This proves that the independent schools of Scotland have no doubt seen foreign languages in the future as necessary capability for young and children.
Languages are now cultivated as an axe of education (i.e., skill, technology, engineering and math) in the curriculums of independent schools.
In 2014, one of the principal reasons which was then found in order to fill the job was found in the State Committee of the United States.
More and more, to know languages, it becomes inevitable for the future carriages.
With the more chance of working for languages, these skills are inevitable in the globalized world.
Whatever a career they've chosen, have learned the second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future with the advantage of such a life.
To be able to speak directly to the people in foreign countries, it will automatically put a word in the head of the multiplicant person at the head of the contest.
According to the inkest made by youGov in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language, as it would be a common conversation, and only those who spoke in French would go up to the number of two digits, 15 percent per cent.
That's why it's so important to make investments in language teaching today.
Speaking more than one language, especially what they use in economic developments, will give them more chance to find a better application to your children.
In Scotland, they are distinguished by the language they teach them.
A number of students prefer more modern languages, and others who seem to be important to the United States, such as mandarina or Japanese.
That they are the interests of your child, there will always be an extensive language option to learn in independent schools with professors who are expert in the field.
The object of independent schools of Scotland is to prepare children for success in different tasks at the future, and give them tools for it.
This time we can't deny, in an international business, where languages are necessary for the future of the country, so that in education there is need of reflection.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "translation Communication capacities".
The independent schools will continue to offer their chances, multiplicity, and perfection to the young men of Scotland.
Il faut two le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Independent School Council of Scotland

The next week of Trumpe will be the first of five rises, and he will visit various places with his friends, the other tennessee and Mississippi.
The Republican wants to get the support or protection for elections that Trump should be at the High Court's Square, because the Republicans are in danger of losing Congress's control in the Azar's elections.
What time is the embarrassing mitina of West Virginia today and how do you see it on the Internet?
To return to Trumpe in West Virginia at 7:00 of the afternoon is programmed today, September 29th, 2018, Saturday.
In West Virginia, Trump's mitina can be seen online through Youtub's stream.
It seems that Trump will correct the reports of the named Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court of this week, until the Senate is confirmed by the investigation of the FBI for the lack of sexual attitude.

The President Trump's campaign says the end of the next week of these five mitins to susceptaries and support the majority of the Republicans' Senate and the representatives' houses."

Ryder Cup 2018: US is trying to go on a separate Sunday contest
After three sessions, Ryder Cup had the fourth of Saturday afternoon.
The key for the moment is a sportal concept invented from the top of the game in which players believe it, but not for other competitions.
So, where can you say the time is now?
'They had a six-point advantage, and now they have four, so I think it's time now, somehow,' Jordan Spieth said in a day's field.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points from the twelve plays.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not on their side, and need help, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and got three points from four.
Spieth has been quite decisive, from a draw to green, and is correcting the pattern.
These screams of celebrating have been louder and louder as the turn went on, and it got the important thing, making four-squares, after two lost Thomas.
15. He celebrated it with another cry of like a winch, which means that the American team is not outside the contest.
"You must search for some people, and only take care of your game," said Spieth.
It's what's left for those players.
It's 18 holes to get out of the area.
During the last two days only Spieth and Thomas have got more points to Francesco Molin and Tommy Fleetwood, historical players in the Ryder Cup Games.
The special but charming couple of Europeans are four or four, and they have sworn to be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that hadn't thrown a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning they had the bogeys on Friday afternoon and on Friday nine o'clock.
This turn and the crowd had become a couple of people who had to go over the Sunday, and it was no more famous European players than Fleetwood and Molina, when the sun comes out to shut Europe's victory in the National Golf.
If both are at different holes together, it's better.
Still, it's early to talk about great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson speeded up the work of Sergio García when Alex came down with Noren.
They've put a Bogey before two doubles in a ditch that's never too close to the Spanish and the Swedish.
But on Sunday there was no help to get out of your hole.
The quartet was fascinated by the sight of the marriage between the couples, who gave advice to them, which were not given, and saw how to change the strategy for a moment.
Europe played it better as a team, and it had an obvious advantage for the final, but the quartet's session showed that the United States team has the courage to fight, especially if some of the States were in doubt.
Europe has succeeded in the Ryder Cup final advantage of 10-6
Europe has had a significant advantage at the end of Ryder Cup, after the Saturday's fours got 10-6 U.S. State of America.
Tommy Fleetwood and the inspirational couple of Francesco Moline made two victories against Tiger Woods, and they got four precious points in the National Le Golf.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe parted, trying to recover the hope of two years ago in Hazeline, was the morning of the master, and won the series 3-1.
The United States offered a greater resistance, and they won two games, but they could not exceed the difference.
On the other hand, Jim Fury took eight points to keep the reward on 12th-partids per Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie that has gained four successive points, and with Molinari, after an excellent weekend called "Molliwood," Ryder Cup hat's second in four parts gain four points.
After the four-balls Woods and Patrick Reed, he had done a great game with tired Woods and Bryson Dechambeau the American rookie with 5 and 4 light.
Woods, after two games on Saturday, showed them the touchy perfections, but from 29 game he lost 19 at fourballs and foursome times after seven.
Justin Rose rested for four o'clock in the morning, and Henrik returned with Stenson at the fours to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the best and the third of the world.
Europe did not find its way in the pleasant, fresh day of the southwest of Paris.
Three times the Jordan Spiethes and Justin Thomase set reference to the Americans on Saturday for two points.
2-1 was obtained a vague victory from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter on the fourballs and then Poulter and Rory McIlroy after two holes lost in four.
Ryder Cup's hat's history has only twice managed to get four-point-side-point-sides over and into individual parts, although the side of Furyk had only to be drawn to support the prize.
After the second best, in two days, after Sunday's opposite mode, they will be placed before him.
North Korea has given the negative round to leave his weapons without any trust
The foreign minister of North Korea informed the United States on Saturday that the punishments of the United States would prevent their trust in the United States, and that in such a state they would not at all leave a nuclear weapon.
Ri Yong Hok declared that North Korea took the most important measures of good intentions in the world's organization, last year, to break the tests of nuclear weapons and misils, to leave places to make nuclear tests and give them a word of what they're going to be developed by technology and nuclear weapons.
"Well, we don't see any answers for the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in the United States in our national security, and we cannot leave our first weapons alone."
Rik repeated the familiar complaints of the North Korea about the resistance of Washington, inside a "fastal" process of dismantration, where North Korea would be rewarded by step by step. His statement seems to suggest that he hadn't rejected the uncivilization of Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong Unek and Donald Trumpe mentions the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea to the first peak of Singapore on June 12th. Then Kim promised that he would disnubble the Penintsula of the Cat, and Trumpe swore that he would guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is searching for a formal end to the Korea war between 1950-1953 but the United States of America have declared that Pyongyang should leave the first weapons.
Washington does not take notice of the punishments established to North Korea for the international voices.
"The United States say that he must leave his first weapons again, and continues to increase the pressure of punishment, towards the necessity of obtaining their end, and "He is against the expression of the end of the war," said Rik.
"It is the utopia of those who think we are going to be at their feet.
The problem is that the continued penalties increase their disfigurement."
Rik hasn't mentioned the second summit of Kim and Trump the United States leaders in the United States at the beginning of the week.
The minister has mentioned three meetings in the last five months between the Moon Jae, which is the leader of Kim and South Korea, and has added, "If the other side were South Korea instead of the United States, the unnunciation of Korea would not be locked."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech would be quite different in the past year, where the North Korea in the NB's House declared that the missiles were looking down to the United States, Mr. Trump, Mr. President Trubru, since he called Kim "Mrss.misil."
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trumpe stated that he had the North Korea "meaning" because of the boldness of being able to withdraw his arms, but he declared that it was still necessary to do it, and that they would be punished until they were unnubbed in North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump declared that he had no time for it, even if he was two years, three years, or five months, he doesn't care.
China and Russia think that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps given.
But the Secretary of the United States, Mike Pompeo, declared in front of the NB Security Council on Thursday, "It must continue to strengthen the punishments of the Council of Segur, without failing, until we verify that his despair is real."
The security council has susceptized the punishments which were held since 2006 to the North Korea as an attempt to finance the nuclear and Balistic programs of Pyongyang.
Pompeo went with Ri out of the NB's Battle, and then he declared that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare the second peak.
Pompeus has been three times in the North Korea of this year, but the last journey did not go well.
When he returned from Pyongyang on July, saying that there was only one thing for North Korea that he had been accused of doing "gansters" during the hours.
North Korea swore that at a meeting with Moon, the places of misils and nuclear complexs would be left behind if the United States take measures that belong to them."
He told Kim that "personal measures concerning theeurs" were guaranteed to Singapore, and corrected himself to the normalization of Washington's relationships.
Harvard's students have made the lesson of rest enough.
He will sleep more in the year of Harvard University, and try to make the culture of those who learn to spend the night by drinking the coffee.
A teacher saw in the best colleges in the world that students don't get paid in a basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, the medical teacher of sleeping at Harvard's school, and in Brigham Brigham and women's hospitals, designed the lesson that was the first of this kind of EB.
At the time of learning he began to speak a speech about the work of sleep.
"When a girl came near me and said, 'Why should I do that now alone, the last year of my school?'
They didn't tell him how important it is to sleep, and that's what surprised me."
In the course of the year, offered for the former years, the pupils are explained to be the effect of learning and sporting results, besides the improvement of their well-being.
Paul Barrer, Professor of Harvard's medical school and the college health service manager, announced that college had decided to go to school when the students saw him sleep a week.
The long-time learnt takes several interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom where students can see the effect of coffee, curtains, trainers, and books that press the effect of coffee and light, and to see the effect that sleeps too little in sporting performance, and the habit of getting to bed.
In another section, the question shows that too little sleep can strike the hearts, and that it may increase the danger of depression or of becoming cancer.
In a Kanpus map, using interactive icons, parties are invited to think about their daily habits.
"We know we won't change the manners of students suddenly.
But we think they have a right to find out that if you choose to burn cigarettes, it's like you're right to know the consequences you'll have in your health, Czeisler added.
There still exists the pride culture of the "pass", says he, and increases the problem of making more or less pressure between modern technology and students.
To sleep well, with good quality, it must be the secret charm to face stress, fatigue, and nervousness," he said, "and to win weight because the little sleep makes the brain hungry and we'll always be hungry."
The 19-year-old California who learns chemicals and physical biology has helped Professor Czeisler designation and one of his first class in the first year of Harvard.
He declared that the coalman had opened his eyes and had driven him to share in a course where he was being built by the campus.
The next step, he expects, would be asking for an investigation equal to the gradations, before he enters into the competition.
Professor Czeisler recommends to put an alarm on his bed to determine when and to wake up, and to know the effects of the 'blue light' which the electronic screen and the light LED send, which may change the circus paces, and may cause trouble to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengak's men are defeated by Gerrrd.
Rangers have suffered another failure in Dolly Meng's strike on Steve's 1-0 for the Warrd in Livingston.
They wanted to win 4-1 St. Johnstone first, but Gary Holte's team had caused the second failure of the Warrde team 18. In the game, his eight points of the Landbrokes of Chapeler, leaving the heart of the leader of the Landbrokes without control.
Menga had us for seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers' work did not draw.
The Rangers have now gone down to the sixth place, but Livingston has gone up to the third and follow the Hibernian only because of the gol.
The problem might have been worse for the Rangers because Calum Spence had been treated by a head wound because of an object that was thrown out from outside.
Warrd made eight changes and got Ayr Betfred Kop's end.
On the other hand, Livi went with 11 with him, who took the Parts a point in the past week, and would be happy to see how his well-fitted clothes drowned in each turn.
Rangers ruled property, but Livingstone took more advantage of their battles.
The Scotch Pittmani Allan McGregor should be thrown into the gorge by Meng, but the halfer didn't take the chance.
A deep free shot in Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow had only managed to get away to the back staircase.
Rangers took control, but in the latter he seemed to have more hope in their game than belief.
Alfredo Morelos thought he must be a penalty on the frontier of the quarter, when he and Steven Lawless made a speech, but Steven Thomson did not appreciate the appeals of the colony.
Rangers got only two shots out in the first half, but Liam Kelly's ex-keeper at Ibrox had hardly had any trouble with Lasana Coulibaly's head and the light blow of Ovie Ejaria.
Livi would perhaps have injured the first goal that had been introduced in 34, but nobody can deny the great effort they had done.
The Rangers did not succeed once more in a fight at Jacobs' ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Delan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, and he picked it easy to make a simple ending.
Warrd moved Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during his rest, and the changes were immediate when he passed Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran off his line to lock him up.
But Livingston was still obliged to play their favorite game after the long walks of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the chance to increase his advantage, but McGregor held it firmly before he could take his head from Lithgow's court.
The Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again asked for a penalti when he stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't listen to him again.
Almanaca: Geiger Count inventor
And now a page of our Sunday Day's almanak, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and DENBORA... was born in Germany to the future physics in Johannes Wilhelm "Hans".
Geiger developed a method of delecting and measuring radioactivity-he came from that invention what Geiger was called.
Since then, it's been science's municipal play, and it's turned as in the "Bells of Coronado" film of pop culture, like in 1950, like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were protagonist:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger is the play, used to search for radioactive minerals, for example, season.
When you put these devices, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans, "Yes, you can hear it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, missing a few days to pay 63 years.
But the invention that bears its name is still alive.
A new cartoon against cancer can teach the immunitate system to 'invise'
A new cartoon against cancer can teach the immunitate system to see and kill them.
He teaches the bad cell to know the immunity system inside the treatment
The method lies in altering the cells of immune from the patient and then in the laboratory.
Then they can see a protein that's common in many cancers and then renovate
The test counter is giving very good results for patients with various types of cancers.
To a woman who has been treated with the imbecile culprit that teaches the Immunity system to disappear more than 18 months.
The method lies: when the culptural culpture from the patient is ripped out and changed in the laboratory, to make a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then to revise the cells.
Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of the United States of Bethesda, said, "Our results show us a great future carcasse."
HER2, "That makes the growth of the various kinds of cancers," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach from the patients to the immune cells and how to reach the Cartinogens of the cell, has worked in treating a kind of leuzemia.

Kanye West was called in the studio on Saturday night Live when the president of the United States was raised and said he would be there again in 2020 when he said he was going to be president.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, Make America's hat in, Demokrat began a bad act and confirmed his attitude towards Trump.
"When I talk to a white person, they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have been out of America for a long time," he said.
In this SNL, Christine Blasey Ford's session, Brettt Kavanaugh made a witness to the Senate's Judicial Committee of Hollywood.
Even though he wasn't red, the insulting speech of West was up to social networks by Chris Rock the comedian.
It's not clear that he was trying to make Rock West laugh at his release.
Besides, he complained that he had gone wrong in front of the West public because of his cap among his wings.
"I've been excited among the wings.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I'm attacked!
And then they say I'm in a place where I'm buried," he said, according to Washington Aztertur.
Then West said, "Do you want to see where I'm buried?" And he said, "I'll put my superman's cloak on it, which means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want the world to go on?"
Try love."
At least a couple of times the whistles came from the public, and the members of the SNL session seemed ashamed, as Variety announced, and a person who was standing there said to the magazine, "The whole argument was silent."
They brought him to replace Ariana Grande the last few days before he was killed, Rac Miller raper.
Web people were surprised to love it with the interpretation of the song, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West got the protection of Candace Turner, head of the conservative group of TPUS, who published this flute:
But as Karen Hunter had choked the interview-play, he wasn't just West, he was just like him, and that's wonderful.
"But I don't want to reward a person who does an ideology harmful to the community by buying his music or clothes or protecting his "sense"."
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the raper announced that he had changed his name in Twitter, saying, "Three of the time ago his name was Kanye West."
He's not the first artist that changes his name, and he follows Dody's steps, as Puffy, Puffy and P Diddy are also known.
His colleague Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, and not mentioning the same legend as the Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and became the Prince who had hitherto been the artist.

There are more than 82,000 people in the country, as healthginators have said.
More than 40,000 cases have been registered during the second three months in 2018.

Nevertheless, the number of people with GIB and Hiesa in China for years has raised 100,000 people.
Sexu GIB transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.

Maxine Waters has refused the worker's data from the leaked GOP senators, and has legit the risks and co-spirationors.
Maxine Waters reported Saturday that a member of his work team published personal information for the three republicans of the United States on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The democrates in Los Angeles have indicated that assertions were "little-right" experts and websites have driven.
"More lies, lyings, and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a Twitter expression.
The information published was the information of the three senators of the United States- Lindsey of Graham South Carolina and Mike Lee and Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Tuesday, on a hearing from an unknown person at the Capitol Hill, about the unprecedented sexport against Bretttt Kavanaugh, who is the Supreme Court of the Senate.
The leak was asked by the three senators by Kavanaugh and came back later.
According to the juncture of Pundit and RedState, the IP address that identifies the source was associated with the Waters office and published the information of a member of the Waters Workgroup, Hill declared.
"This absence of faith is a false and complete lie," Waters went on.
"My colleagues of work-a personal information, and security in danger, after all those false delegates of fraud-there is no responsibility about the filth of that information.
The absence of groundless alegation is entirely false and absolute lie."
The Waters expression immediately received the reviews online, like Ari Fleischer's old presswriter in the White House.
"That's what you've done from anger," she wrote.
"That proves he has no character in being a member of Congress.
When something that has not been done to anyone, he must not be angry.
He doesn't have to show a challenger.
He must not question the cause of the acusator.
He must be calm and good-natured."
Fleischer seemed to want to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism made by the Judge Kavanaugh, who had been too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, even the republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the election of the election of law, declared his opinions on Twitter.
"If the expression is true," he yelled.
In his statements, Waters said that his office had been observed by "the authorities and the entities to enforce the law for such deceptions.
"We assure you what the broken law will be known," he went on, "that they will answer before the law for any member of my country, and for all my fellow-citizens, and all that is harmful and dangerous."
Johnny English Strikes again critic of the movie - small power Rowan Atkinson spodia
Now it's traditional to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that has a British beam, and it seems that it's not applicable in the frankness of the parody of Johnny English action. It started 2003 with Johnny English and turned back in 2011 with Johnny Reborn.
What kind of garbage do we show about our mind's satisfies, do we get a new export option for our nation?
In any case, with a big out-eyed eye and a face of rubber, Johnny English has recently made a new license to conceal things, his name shows above all things that are not English, that it is only a large comic creation designed for countries designed by the lands designed by the movies which are not in English.
Although it was a special desire to be flattering Glamour, it is a secret agent that looks like Clouseu, of course, a bit of Mr Bean's, and a bit of Olinpiar Games of London, a little bit of the boy who is helping Chariots of Fire with one note.
In the television advertisements of the Barclaycard we have already forgotten, Atkinson interpreted the passenger and based on the mysterious international man, leaving the chaos behind him.
There's a poor moment or two in this last txanny of JE.
I was very fond of how Johnny came up to English with a green armor in the middle of the helicopter and the mill crosses beat him in his helmet.
The gift for the comedy is seen on the screen, but the mood lacks force and is too superfluous, especially when the "serios" filmmarks like 007 and Mission" are now putting the comedy between their components.
Respect seems to be more directed to children than to the adults, and to me Johnny English's foolish adventures are not as clever and clear as the jokes of the character in the Beans of Atkinson's silent movies.
This is the topic constant premise that the Great Britain is in trouble.
A Ziberhacker has been introduced into the supersensible web grid of spies in Britain, showing the identity of all the British agents who work, and it's upset that officer in the service. Unfortunately little paper for Kevin Eldon.
This is too excessive for a Prime Minister, who has been pursued by a man who is already losing his political reputation; Emma Thompson seems almost to be the best person who is like Teresa May, but the script does not help much.
The counselors of his intelligence inform him that all the active spies have been compromised will have to recover someone who is in retirement.
And that means you can walk on the same way as Johnny English is. Now it's a schoolteacher, but there's some pretty jokes in English, because he offers the School of Rock's spies.
They take it back to Whitehall to make an emergency information store and regroup with the Boughs he was his first partner.
He's now a man married, tied to a submarine codor, and Vicki Pepperdine is lost in that paper like a kid.
So we have the Batman and Robin shares of things in the Secret Service of Your Grace, and meet the Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Kurylen with the beautiful fatal femme of Olga Kurylen.
In the meantime, the first minister who says that he can fix the informational misfortunes of Britain. Jason Volta is a malicious collector, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough begin the adventures of their market-houses, disguised as a waitress, and fires to a French restaurant. They create chaos in the luxury of Volta, and the English lights the absolute anarchy when they try to see what Volta's house is inside.
All stops look at that last sequence, but though it's pleasant and noisy, it's all a lot from the TV for children.
Such a mode.
And as I happened to some other pictures of Johnny English, I came to my mind that Rowan Atkinson couldn't give the British film-industria a paper worth his talent?
The Laborist Party refused to work in a week of four days, but he's preparing a plan for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party is studying a radical plan, which the British foresees to work on a week of his friend, but five days to collect.
It seems that the principals of enpreset want to give the parties one day more to them than the revolution of artificial intelligence.
The workers would have three days' weekend, but they would still have the same pay home.
The fountains have indicated that the idea is to enter the part's economic agenda, and that the country is meant to be favored by the workers.
Going to the four working-offs has received the protection of the union Congress, as the way the workmen are changing the economy.
A high party of Laborist says to The Sunday Times, "It is foreseen to announce a new course of politics before the end of the season.
"It's not going to happen from one day to the other, but it's a week in the four lanes with the view that the party has b-error economy for the workman, and with the general industrystrar of the party."
The Laborist Party would not be the one who protects such an idea, because the Party of Berde defended four days' work in the campaign of the general election of 2017.
However, the aspiration has not yet received protection from the entire Laborist Party.
As the voter of the Laborist Party says, "The week of four days is not the policy of the party, and the party does not consider it."
The Ministry John McDonnell in the shadow to determine the view of a social revolution that had been made by the Laborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said, no doubt, that "sighters" and "speakers" were to be rid of the power of public services.
Even in the plans of the minister of the shadow, the present stockings of the water's prescription may not receive their whole share, for a laborary government could be made to see that there was a bad behavior.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans for entering the employees in the represet directorships and creating the Funts of the Inclusive Ownership, to give 10 workers % of the capital of private sectors, where they were paid by the yearly division between 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tells the FBI's research to change their opinion.
With regard to the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI has at least postponed his appointment for the Supreme Court for a week, and has doubted whether the conclusions of the investigation could be removed by a republican senator or not.
On a conversation sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley, who is Correspondent 60 Minutes, asked John Kennedy and Lindsey to the Republicans of Graham, whether the FBI could change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his party in South Carolina.
"I suppose so," said Kennedy.
"I said, when I went to the hearing, I said, 'I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this, he was given to know him, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He replied with enthusiasm, obviously.'
Graham's votes seem to be written on the rock.
'I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and he'd stand the charge that would cause a blow,' he said.
'Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett refused very firmly,' added Graham, referenceing to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he talks about could not verify that.
She's 36.
I can't see anything new."

Those who want to go to the concert must send an e-mail to a leader of the world, send an e-mail, call a phone call or serves to help the purpose of destroying poverty.
But what success has Global Citizen succeeded when he is 12 years old to fill his end?
Is it the original idea of asking people to do an action by a Doa concert, or is it another case of what they call "clicktivism," that is to say, to make them feel a real change by signing an online request or sending people a chio?
Since 2011, General Citizen says that he has registered more than 19 million of his followers with pressure to so many ends.
It is said that the leader of the world has driven these actions to predict more than 37 billion, and to predict the engagements than $37 billion, and these policy and engagements will have influenced more than two-25 billion lives than 2030 years before the year.
At the beginning of 2018, the groups of three 90 engagements and predictions derived from the action, and of which ten billions have already been paid or received.
As the team calculates it's been a direct impact on all over 649 million people.
It's the Nutrition of the Power of the Conpromiss, an investmentist and investor who has an engagement of their whole power, an inplementator in the United Kingdom. He's promised that he'll give Runda 5 million $5 million in a country where the malnuting disappears, after he has received more than 4700 gulden from the Global Citizens.
"We will make the social injustice of disunity with the aid of the United States, the free authorities, the national governments, and the members of the Citizen generals," said Ullman ambassadors of the Power of Nutrition in public in a direct concert of London in 2018.
Besides, the team has said that after doing more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of amen and children, the government announced that the Power of Nutrition would finify the project. This project will help 5 million women and children by the hands of the nutrition.
Answering this FAQ question they have in their website, "What makes you think we can destroy the poorness of the end?"
And Citizen general said, "It will be a long and difficult road, and we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like great motions against our former civil rights and apartheid, we shall also succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle will be Monáe in the show of the year in New York.

The US ambassador accused China of propaganda instructors.
One of the officials of China put on a four-page advertisement that the advantages of the commerce between America and China were susceptible in a newspaper of ABE, the Ambassador of the United States has accused Beijing that he had used the American press to spread his propaganda.
The president of Donald Trump America, the Chinese newspapers in Des Moines Register, the second newspaper that is sold in Iowa, mentioned the extra one that had gone Wednesday, after he accused China to try to join the elections of the 6th of November 6th United States.
The accused who tried to join the elections of Beijing is marked by Trump what the U.S. officers said to Reuters, who was getting up in Washington to make the Chinese pressure.
If it be normal that foreign governments place commercials to promote commercials, they are locked up at this moment in a trade war which is being raised up by Beijing and Washington, and each country has placed their bowels to the importations of the other.
The repressional awards of China, at the beginning of the trade war, had been protected by the Republican Party of Trump, to attack the exportations of the country like Iowa, as stated by China and the American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassadors of China, and the governor of Iowa for a long time, that is, of one of those who export most farmers to China, has remarked that Beijing has been harmed by the American workingmen, peasants, and business.
When Branstad pointed out on an article from Sunday's Des Moines Register, "Txina's attack is now growing stronger in our free press."
"He's using a strong tradition for the free press of America, and a strong tradition for the press-officials of the Chinese government in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"The press point here in the Rue Beijing there is very few disidental voices, and there is no real reflection of different opinions in China which the Chinese people may have in relation to the conflicting economic career, which the media depends on the firm control of the Chinese Communist."

The republicans shake women's voters before the elections of the central legislation with the Kavanaugh debane, analist remarked.
As many members of the upper class are waiting, and as they defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brettt Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the analists have remarked that among women, especially in the elections of the next central law.
The emotions about this subject have been very large, and most of the republicans are registered to show that they would go on with the boot.
"We can't go back on these accounts," said the Professor of Maxwell at the University of Reeher Syracyse about an article published on the The Hill Saturday.
Reeher said he's doubted that the senators of Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) could do the pressure for a FBI investigation to calm the voters who are angry.
'The women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow and even November,' said the manager Karine Jean-Pierre, and the national speakers of the MoveOn team, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, "It's November!" cried the Protestants, protesting in front of the Senate, that the republics who control the Judicial Committee had decided to continue with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democracrators will be out of place," said Stu Rothenberg the independent political analist to the website of the news.
"The people say that he's had a great influence on his clothes, that's true.
But it may still be more influenced, especially between women and young men who do not have a fixed vote between them, between the 20th and 29 years, considering that even if they often do not please the President they have no vote."
Even before the public testimony that Ford described the details of sex in the Supreme Court, the analists suggested that the republicans might be a fall if they decided to continue with confirmation.
"It has become a great riot for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former President of the Republican Committee, according to the NBC News at the beginning of the week.
"The question is, whether the votes of the board should be placed in the chair of the last votes or in the accused Kavanaugh, and how the republicans handle this subject and how they treated the woman," explained the report channel to Guy Cecil "Porities USA".
But the Americans seem to be quite divided at the time when they determine which they believe among the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, but they seem to do more for the second.
Since youGov's new inchesta shows that the 41% of the people who have been part believed in certainty or sure that they believed the testimony of Ford, and 35% of the truth or sure of Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38% said that Kavanaugh was probably lying in his statement, and 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, Ford's office is currently investigating FBI, and at least another accuser has been done by the Deborah Ramirez.
Last week he declared in the oath that the Senate Committee was drunk by Kavanaugh when he was 17.
Ramirez has arrived that the president of the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a party at Yale in the decades of 1980.

According to the executive John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to help all of us use resources, processes, and suitable capability.
Now, these are the companies that form a Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBMk, some developers hired to work in the project and a volunteer community.
From this week on, the world's technology developers would have to generate diszentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.

"We're not asking permission to him."
On a post published by the medium Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "mission is a system that protects the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."

Bernard Vann, they said they had chleric with the Victoria Cross of the First World.
The first warrior of the World War, who has received the only chalk of the Church of England, has been found in his country, a hundred years later.
Reverend Bernard Vann Coronel won his prize on September 29, 1918 at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a Frankist killed four days later, and he never knew that he had received the supreme British prize for military honor.
A stone of memory was displayed by his two grandchildren on a Saturday on the Rushden of Northamptonshire.
One of the Bilobs, Michael Vann, said that the stone was "very symbolic," was rewarded to his grandfather and to display it a hundred later.
According to London Gazette, the Colonel Vann, September 29, 1918, led his battalion along the St.Quentin Channel under the constant fire of guns and machinery.
Then he went quickly to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage he led the line forward until he found a cannon alone and threw it down to three of the detachments.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German Frankger in October 4, 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, the 72-year-old, said he knew that his grandfather's actions would never be able to do the same, but that is very humiliating.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, had built a flower-core after the disfile.
Michael Vann said, "It was a great honor for the people to share in thefile," and added, "that the protection of many people will prove the courage of a hero in the world."
The MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but they put Peppa Pig instead of it.
Suppose you wake up all night to see Bellator 206, people full of people, and then they don't let you see the main show.
The Saint Jose signes had 13 battles between six of them in the main calendar, and it was to be given directly at night in the United Kingdom, in the 5th Channel chain.
At six o'clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the audience of the United Kingdom left the cover as soon as Peppa Pig had changed.
Some of them were not surprised after the hour of the morning's hour's awake for the fight.
A follower described the change for the living drawings for Twitter's children as "supposeous joke."
"A law of Gobernu said that it was not proper for 6:00 in the morning, and they had to change their programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, when the Chief President of Bellator and Communication asked him about what they had done.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker president of Bellator company said they're going to check the program in the future for the United Kingdom audiences.
'I think when I think about the repetition, I think it's very likely that we can fix it,' said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning of Sunday, and we can't fix it till Sunday, Monday then.
But we're working for it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there was a lot of messages going forward and back, and they were not very pleasant.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government thing.
I promise you the next time it won't happen again.
We're going to put five fights instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to offer more to people, and we went to the ground.
Unfortunately it's a situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley in regard to sex
The Olympian dome Tom Daley said that he had grown up by the feeling that he had been despised by sex, but that gave him a chance to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to the secondary school he didn't realize that they were not all like him.
When Lauren Laverne spoke of the first Desert Island Discs offered by Radio 4, he said he talked about the rights of homosexuals to give them "suropen."
Besides, he said that the Olympic play had brought him less importance to gain.
The usual exhibition of the program that's been long ago, Kirsty Young, has taken several months' holidays for the disease.
When the first program of Laverne had been completely lost, Daley said to everyone else that society felt "feeded" because it didn't allow him to please the boys and girls."
He said, "Ten to this day, the feelings which you feel despised and different from others have been the true reasons that have given me the power of success and strength."
He wanted to prove that he had something to do with because he didn't want to spoil people when they told him about his sexuality.
The sporting sport that won two bronze medals in the Olympic games has become the SUB SUDES, and the greater part of the Common-wealths in Australia used to dispense homosexuality.
He said he felt that he had given his opinion that he had great luck because he could live without being able to live in open ways, and because he wanted to give the others "suppose."
He said that he had been in love with a man in the world three times, "Dustin Lance the American filmmaker, whom he knew in 2013, was caught with saorpres."
Dany married the winner of the sea-between 20 years older than the same, but he said the difference between them was not a problem.
He said, "When you're young and you've been through so many things." "He went to the Olympic games at 14, and his father died with cancer three years later-it's hard to look for someone of the same age who had passed similar accidents.
The couple became the father of the son Robert Ray Black-Daley in the June, and Daley said he changed his "full vision."
"If you'd asked me about last year, 'I've got to win a gold medal,' he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than the gold medals of the Olympic games.
My golden medal is the Olympic Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, after he had been killed in 2011 after his brain cancer diagnosis.
Daley said he didn't accept his father going to die, and he asked them that there was one of the last things he had asked-if he had cards for the games in London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first line.
'I couldn't say, 'You're not going to be in the first line, father,' he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I didn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he died," he said.
The next day Daley took part in the Olympic games of 2012 and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that it was all my life that I had dreamed of, in the olymps of playing before the public, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song selection, "Proud, of Heather Small," which made him identify throughout all the process of preparing the olympic game, and still put the hen-pige.

Mickelson, who was not in the shape, sat on his chair on the Saturday Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he play Ryder Cup, 47, but he'll have to improve his form not to look bad.
The mark of Mickelson was breaking at the last two years of the act of playing 12. However, Captain Jim Fury sent him to his chair on the fourballs of Saturday and foursome Modalities.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as often as it has been for the United States, the five-time chief champions divided the day from one side to another, and the hope of conducting the game in the field.
It was never the correctest of the drivers, nor even the best moment of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the best chance to compete the dynamics of the National Golf, which are lost by the hardest players.
And even if the field does not fear enough, Mickelson, at the nineth game, is going to face the British Open Champion of Francesco Molin, which has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win four games of this week.
If the Americans start at 12 single games under four points, if they have a good beginning, they may be quite a decisive game of Mickelson.
Fury declared confidence in his man, for he could not say much more.
"He understood the paper he had today, struck me a little on the back, and told me tomorrow he would be ready," said Fury.
"She has great confidence in herself.
He's a top-point sporter and he's really given these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see two games playing.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and we thought we should have behaved like that.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will survive the record of Nick Faldo on Sunday as the Ryder Cup game has played.
This may be the end of the career of Ryder Cup that has never reached its individual mark.
Mickelson won 18 times, he lost 18 times, and stopped seven times in it. But, according to Furyk, he's brought up something that's impossible to touch the team.
"It makes me laugh, and it's sarcastic, and it's very clever, and it's a joke with people, and it's a great thing to be his presence," he declared.
"The little gamblers have enjoyed a lot of fun playing against him this week, and it's been fun to see.
He does much more than play."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows the great advantage they have to disappear immediately
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has been able to know that at the last quarter of the day there is a great advantage, but that Ryder Cup could be an easy commodity.
The debutans who had been Valderraman in 1997. There, under the command of Seve Ballesteros, had the advantage of five points against the US, but they drew close to the game with the score 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
'I always remind myself that we had a great advantage in Valderraman and that we had scarcely won, and that we lost in Brookline, although we had a great advantage, Bjorne (in the photograph) said, after the 2018 class won on Friday and on Friday, at 6 p.m.
So history tells us that both me and all teammates haven't finished this yet.
We'll be doing it with all our respects tomorrow.
We'll get out of the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are on the clipboard.
We're going to win the trophy, so we'll take care of it.
As I've always said, I'm paying attention to 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the opposite side-the best players in the world."
With the achievements that his players made in a difficult golffield, Bjorne said, "I never want to make anything.
Tomorrow.
It's the turn of individuals tomorrow, and it's something else.
It's amazing to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, every golf player must prove its full capacity.
That's the best thing you've got tomorrow.
Now forget about your comrades, for they must get their best."
As not Bjorn, Jim Fury thinks they're going to play better than his own players are, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from four points.
Fury has been the same way on both sides of these last days, as a partner of the Brookline team, and afterwards lost the ward against the Europeans, when the Europeans did "Medina miracle."
"I remember all the words I've said," he said, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw had encouraged the players the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep our advantage at the start, like Brooklinen and Medinan.
The advantage of the other side, there are many pressures in these intermediate games.
We have decided on that list of players, and we think we're going to do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas has a contractor work, and Rory McIlroy will have the last match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans of the middle order.
"I have chosen this place in this order, because it is possible to make a full journey," said Bjorn about the selected individuals.
They've retarded the construction of new German warship.
The new marine fraquete of Germany had been required in 2014, for the old warships of Horace, but at least it will not be built until the next year, as it is said to be more and more costing systems and costs, as well as the media of the local community.
The request of the warship called Rheinland-Pfalz (the chief fragata of Baden-Wuerttemberg) has been postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit had mentioned a military voter.
The boat was to be entered 2014, but the issues which followed were prevented from making this great ambition project.
The four ships from Baden-Wuerttemberg requested in 2007 will be replaced by the old fragatas of Bremen.
It seems that a powerful cannon, a feature against air ships, and a secret action, (such as radar is reduced, and will have infrastic signatures and ankustics).
Besides, the longer power of maintenance may also be, the most recent fragata can be two years out of original ports.
However, these warships with continuous delays, which have the tip-off technology (which are designed to project their power) will be deprecated when they enter the service, says Die Zeit the newspapers.
In the year when F125 monks had finished wrong, the German army broke off officially and returned to the Bossola and Vohm of Hanburg.
It was the first time that the Marsa had brought back a boat after he had delivered it.
The reasons for translation are not known, but the German Communications mentioned the serious "software and hardware," and, consequently, the warship would be inexhaustible if it was used.
They were specially important software mistakes, the boats of Baden-Wuerttemberg class at 120 o'clock, i.e. half of those in the Bremen's class.
Besides, the ship has too much weight, and consequently the performance of it is much diminished, and it is harder for the marina to increase its novelty in the future.
The 7,000 tons of Rheinland-Pfalz weighs double ships of the same kind as Germany used in the Second World War.
In addition to the imperfect hardware, there is a problem with the full project price (including the practice).
It's supposed to be $3100 million from the 2200th to the beginning.
Problems with new fractures are even more important in the warnings they say that the power of the German marina is diminishing.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, who is the head of the defendant of the German Parliament, declared that the marina's "a useful vessels are being exhausted."
The delegate has said that the matter has increased more and more, since the old ships have not been postponed.
He called out that he hadn't been in the flint of a school of Wuerttemberg.
The National Trust organization has watched the secret life of the bats
A new investigation has been done on a part of the mountains of Scotland to see how the mice use the landscape to feed.
More information about the behaviour of these special mammals, in the future to protect them in order to determine better.
The investigation of the National Trust (NTS) organisational scientists will follow the mouse common nano and soprano bat and the earring and Daubenton bat in the gardens of Wester Ross.
Special writers will be placed in the essential positions, and the mouses will be continuation of activities that are going through the course of the season.
Workers in the United Kingdom's health system (NHS) will also make cellular drills with manual detectors.
When the experts make the sound analysis of all the writers, the frequency of the bats calls will be known, as well as what each species does.
Then the habitat's map and report will be made to get a dim image of the landscape scale of the batzar's behavior.
As Rob Deware is counselor of the natural power of NTS, the most important field of the batzar will be determined, as well as the use of each species.
This information will be determined by the advantages of habitata treating work, e.g. the origin of the grass, and the bats, and the species of related to them, as well as the forests.
The bat-populazioa in Scotland and the entire kingdom of the United States made it evident that it has gone down the century.
They are threatened by buildings and development works, which affect the nests, and lose their habitat.
The windboats and the butterflies lead the risk and the paper to catch flies, the chemical treatments of buildings, and the attacks of domestic cats.
Mouses are not really blind.
However, as they hunt at night, they are more useful to their ears than their eyes, at the moment of their prey.
In order to sum up the bugs and obstacles in the flight road, they use a sophisticated cocatual cocatus by echo.
The NTS organization is responsible for 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectors of Scotland, and takes very seriously batteries.
He has paid ten experts, which are regularly observed, the examinations of the nests, and sometimes the rescues.
For the institutions have created a Dumfries and Threaves of Galloway, the first and one mouse-species of the Scotch.
David Thompson, who is the manager of the land, is the best land for them.
He said, "We have a great attitude for the Threaven batzar."
"We have old construction trees and many years of trees, and it's a very good habitata.
However, there are still many things unknown about the mice; so we shall understand what they need of health to do here and in other lands."
Thompson has shown that it is very important to see if there is a batman before he performs the work of mutiny in the goods; for if he destroys the only wind of his mother, it is possible to kill 400 female bats and little bats, and perhaps the whole population of the place might disappear.
The mouses are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill them, to pursue or disturb them, even to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representing the organization for the batzar, has requested the support of the general population.
He said, "We must still learn a lot about mice, and we don't know how many of the species live with us."
Ronaldo has eliminated rapeacations while his lawyers are hurrying to accuse the German magazine.
The rapalations against him said that "precessives" are false, and that those who have done it have only wanted to have the power of obtaining it by their name.
They're preparing to report the German reporter Der Spiegel who published his lawyer.
A US woman named Kathryn Mayorga of Portugal and Juventuse has been accused of raping Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he thought he paid him $375,000 for a secret event, as Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
In a few hours, Ronaldo has done a direct video of the Instagram for 142 million followers on the platform whose charges are "pressive."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What I said today is false news," said the football player who won the Golden Baloia five times in front of the camera.
"They're trying to get the privilege by using my name.
It's normal.
They're trying to get my reputation, but that's what happens in my profession.
"I'm a happy man, and everything's all right," said the player, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are being prepared to sell Der Spiegel for charges, who are "acceptable publication on the suspicions they make of."
The lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will ask for damage, as far as he is concerned with the anxiety of his life, which is one of the most serious urines of personal rights.
It happened in an ekaian supposed events in 2009 on a Palms hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After they had met in a nightclub, they thought they had gone to Ronaldo and Mayorga Player's bedroom, where he had been raped by the documents of Clark County Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed event, and said that he was a good man of about 99an, but was failing "some hundred."
The documents say Ronaldo confessed that the couple had been sexual intercourse, but that the relationship was allowed.
Even Mayorge said he went to the police and had photographs of his wounds in the hospital, but later he had come to an out-of-the-way agreement, because the 'repressions' had been most afraid of being humiliated.
Because she has said 34 years ago, she wants to throw the deal back because it's supposed to be an event, and she's still traumatized.
When an unexpected attack happened, Ronaldo was on his way to change the real Madrid from Manchester United, and went last summer to the great Italian Juve team of $100 million.
Brexit, the United Kingdom will always regret to lose self-fabrikors
The United Kingdom will always regret to be the self-fabricators after "Brexit" as the Greg Clark merchant said.
He also said that Toyota UK is "consulturable" will stop the production of the factory with the United States from the European Union.
"We must have an agreement," said Clark.
As the Japanese auto-fabricant says, the delays that would be due to an unconstrained "Brexit" might cause a loss of jobs.
Burnaston's factory, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis vehicles of Toyotra, had almost 15,000 cars in the year that he had gone, and 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If the United Kingdom leaves without an agreement at the end of March from Europe, our factory will stop," said the administrator of Marvin Cook Burnaston, the director of Toyota.
Some other self-fabricators in the United Kingdom (as Terda, IMW, and Jaguar Land Rover) have also declared that they are not afraid to be done without agreement from the European Union.
IMW, for example, says that after the "Brexit" he'll close his Mini factory for months.
The principal concern of the auto-fabricators is the dangers of supplying the chain, if they do not deal with the "Brexit".
The production line of Toyota is "the current in the world," and the pieces arrive once in 37 minutes, both in the United Kingdom and the European Union providers, for all the cars that they ask.
If the United Kingdom leaves without an agreement at the 29th of March from the European Union, it may be broken by the boundaries, and consequently delays and piercities.
It would not be possible for Toyota to store the inventory for more than one day in the factory of Derbyshire, and consequently the production should be stopped.
At Clark's, the plan for the future relations of Europer Union is to avoid these medical examinations of the Great May.
"We want the best deal to make sure not only the current success, but in the future to make use of this option," said BBC Radio 4 strings today.
"In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have proved that the supply chains of provisions which are very successful are necessary to follow them."
Toyota could not tell how long the production will be stopped, but that the length of time would reduce the competition of the factory by means of additional costs, and consequently he has remarked that jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnastone for 24 years, said, "I hope we won't recover these jobs if you lose them."
A government speaker said, "We have described a specific and convincing plan for future relations with Europar Union."
It may be retarding the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein at the White House's command
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein's replacement general fiscal system could be "a week back," while Brettt Kavanaugh's conflicting party for the Supreme Court, the White House says on Sunday.
In the United States' elections, the connection between Trump's assistants and Russia, and Mueller is investigating the supposed justice of the president.
Trumpe fired the general replacement fiscial and, therefore, has been told whether Muelle's independence is in danger in the last months of Washington.
This month before, New York Times announced that Rosenstein had taken a secret microphone to burn with Trump, and to remove the president from his post by following the 25th article of the United States.
Rosenstein rejected the information.
But on Monday he went to the White House, while the information they said he would dime was fired.
Instead, he said he would have a meeting with Trump on Thursday at the United States of New York at the very moment.
Trumpe said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, but then he's delayed not to conflict with the judicial power of Sense; that commission, Kavanaugh, and one of the women accused of making sex with him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, was tested.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week's research, so the Senate's vote has been delayed even more.
Sarah Sanders Fox News chained on Sunday.
When they asked him about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "It's not yet set up, it's likely this week, but I'd understand to postpone again for another week, whatever happens in the Supreme Court."
However, we shall see him; I always like to keep him on a particular press."
Some journalists will not agree with that expression, because Sanders has not given a White House press conference from the 10th of September.
The exhibitionist Chris Wallace asked the reason for that.
In Sanders', the press conferences haven't been missing that the reporters on TV are "greats," but he said, "I agree that they're too big."
Then he suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president is much more interested in questions than his predecessor," he said, and added, without mentioning the evidence, "We have checked these statistics."
Sanders said that the press will continue to do it, but if the priest has an opportunity of asking the President of the United States, that is much better than asking me.
We try to do that many times, and you have seen that we have often done it for the last few weeks, and that will replace the press conference when we give a chance to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers when question comes out of the White House, when he shares in open sessions, or the dignitaries visit the press conferences.
He doesn't do his own press conferences.
The President of the United States has shown the possibility of this situation in New York this week when he was expontaneous and sometimes curious to the reporters he had collected.
The secretary of the united kingdom of health has written a letter to the European Union workers who work on the Scotch NHS system of Scotland, for concerning "Brexit"
The secretary of the healthfield has written to the European Union workers who work in the Scythian health system, to thank the whole country, and to wait for it after the "Brexit."
The United Kingdom is written by the parliamentary of Jean Freeman Scotland for less than six months.
The government of Scotland has already agreed to take the cost of demands for the "bistanle state" of the citizen of the Union which works in public services.
This was said by Freeman in his letter, "In the United States, the negotiations about "Brexit" have advanced between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and it is expected that there is a decision for autumn.
Nevertheless, the government of the United Kingdom increases preparations for a possible outcome without commerce.
I know it's a very preoccupied time for you all.
That's why I want to confirm that I appreciate the contribution of each workman, even though his nationality is all.
The colleagues of the European Union, also outside, bring useful experiences and capabilitys, and improve health service in favor of the patients and the community we serve.
She's your house, no doubt, and we hope to live with her."
They've worked Christion Abercrombie on the head of an emergency after having a wound.
Christion Abercrombie Tennessee State Tigers's aggression has been severely operated on his head after having lost a wound on Saturday at 31 and 27 at the Vanderbilt Commodores team, as reported by Mike Organ of Tenness.
Rod Reed Tennessee is the chief coachman of the team, the player has had a little time before the middle of his game breaks his head wound.
"He melted into the band of the battle and fainted," Reed said.
Abercrombie is given in the band the medicials and personal medicians, and they have been carried in a bed to make a deeper medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State Team in Nashville (Tennessee) said to Chris Harrisi in the WSMV chain that he's out of operation and that he's in the Fury of Vanderbilte.
As Harris said, "They haven't given the sort of wound or the anxiety yet," and they're trying to determine when the wound happened in the Tennessee State team.
He's in his second year with abercrombie redelastics, and he's got his first period in the Tennessee State team after transferring it from Illinois.
He made five plates on Saturday before he went out of the game, and he had over 18 plates all the time.
The foreign buyers will have to pay more tax on the tinbre when they buy goods in the United Kingdom
The foreign buyers will have to pay a bigger tax on the tinbre, when they buy goods in the United Kingdom, and the more additional ones will be used to help those who are left without a house, according to the plans of the conservative party.
This strategy is designed to neutralize the success of young voters by Corbyne.
In the United Kingdom it will be for those who do not pay taxes to the increase of the taxes on the tinbre
If they think of the Public Treasure, they'll collect more than 120 million pounds of a year to help homeless people.
The foreign buyers will have to pay a bigger tax on the tinbre when they buy the goodies in the United Kingdom, and it will be used to help those who have remained without a house, as has been said today by Theresa May.
This strategy is to neutralize the success of the young voters, which Corbyn has been brought to the young voters, and has promised Corbyne to give them homes with reasonable prices, and to pay more taxes to those who have most paid money.
In the United Kingdom it will be for persons and enpress, who do not pay taxes to increase the taxes on the tinbre, and the increase of the causes which the government sleeps on the street will be used to reduce the persons of the collected.
The other charge, which is an additional tax over the current tinbre, including two years of age for the second house entered, and the high-level taxes bought for the fines that were bought for rent), can be dropped up until three per cent.
If they think of the public treasure, they'll collect more than 120 million pounds of a year.
It is calculated that those who are not living in the 13th Percentage of the built in London buy them; and consequently the prices grow up, and it is harder to enter into the house-scene for those who want to buy for the first time.
The wealthy fields of the country, especially the capitals, have become the "mamulands," for foreign buyers spend most of the time outside the city.
To help the young people buy their first apartment after Boris Johnson's demand to reduce the tax on the tinbre, this new policy.
The price of the beavers who had not bought and left the earth to keep it high, and asked May to leave the priceless houses of the right price, in order to repair the "crisy of life" of the Great Britain."
Corbyn, on the other hand, has introduced several attractive reforms about the housing, others, under control of the rents, and "no reason."
Besides, the township wants to give them more power to build more housing.
May said, "I said that my President would take the British dream first, that is to say, I'd say, I'd prefer to make the life of every new generation.
That means fixing the idea of housing.
The doors of Great Britain will always be open to those who live there, work, and want to arrange their lives.
Nevertheless, it is not fair that the British people who don't live in the United Kingdom and work for foreign enpress are as easy to buy homes as they are.
For too many people, the dream of being possessed of a house is too far away, and the dignity of those who are to sleep in the street is still here."
Jack Ross, "To be a coach of the Scene Group" is my greatest wish."
Jack Ross Sunderland's head says he's his "mercior" to be the training of the Scotland team someday.
The Sicilian of 42 years is enjoying the challenge of reviving the north-east club, League One at the third position to three points from the first position.
This summer he came to Stadium of Light, for the time when he had returned to the Premiership of Scotland.
"I wanted to play as a gambler for my country.
I won a league of B Ligako trophy, and that's all,' Ross said in the Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I saw the Games of Scotland from small days with my father Hampden, and I have always wanted to return.
However, I had only the chance to handle the club."
Amongst those who were training in Sunderland before Ross, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
As Allo Athletic's ex master said, he did not feel nervous to come after such a great name; for Barnsley and Ipswich refused to offer them to train.
"Can I get the club back to Premier League?"
As the structure and installation of the club must be in Premier League, no doubt," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as successful if I don't succeed."
For only three years Ross has been training as a coach, one of the principal Dumbarton's assistant and one of the Parts's trainers after 15 months.
Then he helped Allo to recover from the third level, and, thanks to him, he passed to be a champion to come down to St. Mir.
Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than when Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Miilton and Hamilton was in the Academic teams.
"Perhaps it was a cross-road to me," he said, taking care of Allo.
"I really thought it was the best job for me to be a gambler.
It's strange to say that, for I was a good gambler, I had a good life, and I lived a few important things of glory.
But playing can be tough.
You have to take a lot of stuff every week.
I've still got to bear the stress and pressure of work, but I'm happy as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable in my skin than ever.'
All the interview will be given on September 30 (igande) radio on the Sportsound session of Scotland until 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
It's the best time on Saturday for a drink, according to an inksta.
Thanks to the summer stove, there's a lot of money in the British pubs, but the pressure increases for restaurant chains.
The sales for the Pub and the bar chains have got up 2,7 per cent, but the restaurant's is 4,8 percent, as they say.
Peter Martin says he's working on the CGA business station where he's collected his data, 'cause the sun's gone all the time, and the England team lasts more than I think in the Futbol Games in the world, like July data ekaine, where the pub entrys have been raised 2,8 per cent, but the restaurants have gone down even more.
Even if the sales of the restaurants came down 1,8, they were even worse in July.
The pubs and Taberns who specialize in the woods have been much better surrendered, and they have been more than the salment of restaurants.
Even pubs that experience in food have suffered under the sun, but not as well as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to drink a drink.
The sales of Pub and Tabern's drinks have gone up 6 percent last month, and the foods have gone down three per cent.'
Paul Newman, who's at the RSM company's leisure and the hostalist, says, "These are the results of the tendency we have seen from the end of the April.
The most important factors are the influence of the weather and sports about trade sales outside the house.
It's no wonder that the restaurant chains have economic estus, and that they're going down 4,8 percent of the sales will produce important damages besides the still pressure around the cost.
The summer, long and warm, comes in an inconstancy in the bad time for the stables of the food, and it is to be seen that the moderated temperatures in August will be calmed."
The top of the Pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened stablecence, has been 2,7 percent in July, where chains have been slowed up.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index reviews the sales of the sector on the U.S. pub, taverns, and restaurants of the United States, collected and analysed by the 47 operator team. These Operators have more money entries than 9,000 million pounds. This is what is considered as the point of reference to the sector.
One of five children has a lot of social networks that hide from their parents
One of the five children (as young as 11 years) are concerned in social networks where one hides them from parents and teachers, according to an inkesta.
In an inchesta of 2,000 educational students, it has been possible to see that false Instagram accounts have been raised.
The fear of publishing sexual content has increased.
Twenty percent of students says they have a "nagusi" thing that parents can see.
But one of the five children (as young as 11 years) have a lot in social networks hidden from adults.
It has been possible to see that 2,000 school students have gone up a lot of fake Instagrams (the Instagram is the website to share the photos).
The fear of publishing sexual content has increased.
Twenty per cent of students says that they have a clean "burst," which they can see by their parents, but that they have private accounts too.
A mother found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter unintentionally, where a teenager called them "Fuck me."
Since this research has been explained by the American Digital Aware UK and the Subference of Substances in independent schools, 40 percent of the children of 11 years old has two profiles, and half of them admits that they have private matters.
Mike Buchanan HMC's head says, "It's hard to be tempted to create secret spaces online by teenagers, who can't find them by parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle will be a thercade of theatlets on the stage of Scotland atletism
Eilidh Doyle has been designated as an ex-exemplary director of the atletism Committeetor of Scotland in the general assembly of the year of the administration counter.
Doyle is the most rewarded at the door of Scotland, and the manager Ian Beattie said this change is a good chance for those who lead sports to make use of the vast experience he had in the last decades.
"Eilidhe has an enormous respect for the State, the Kingdom of the United States, and the atletism of the whole world, and we know that he will be very useful to the Atletism of Scotland to be in the board," says Beatti.
Doyle said, "I like to be an umbrella athlete, and I hope I'll make a big contribution and run sport in Scotland."
The US won the races of 200 and 400 metres in the Olympic Games of 1996 Atlanta, and has four medals of gold.
He wrote in Twitter, "Once a month ago, I've had an incredibly.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said I'd be back to see him or not, or how high.
It's been very hard, but I'm completely restored. I had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing business business today.
Thank you for the messages you sent me to give me!"
A advertisement for milking which my mother compares with cows has caused opposite opinions on the Internet
A company of milking companies has produced opposite opinions on the Internet compared to the cows in jets.
To make an exposition of what's supposed to be used to the first dusk in the world, Elvie's company, who's working technology for the consumptions of an inspirator in a music video, has been released to show the freedom to the mothers that new device comes out of milk.
They dance in a juggler full of four straw women who are really mothers, with a song of these words and like them, "Yes, I sit down, but I don't stick," and "Maybe you didn't realize it, but these are not peeties, but my tits."
"Here's the fool, 'Take milk, milk, give the little children, take milk, take milk, take milk, I'm milking my girls.'
However, this advertisement published by the company on the Facebook page has created a discussion on the Internet.
With 77,000 inspections and hundreds of comments, the video has caused several reactions in the audience, and many have said that it doesn't really take the "sweetty" of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to make the publicity of this product.
Like us, they must also be pregnant and erdived to produce milk, but they steal their young ones to a few days after their birth," said a user.
Elvie can be introduced in a discrete-of-sharp (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "Very traumatic, of course, for the mother and the kid.
But why don't you use them to make the publicity of a milk-meat for their mothers?"
"There's no such thing as that."
Others have defended the advertisement, and a woman has declared that it was "a way to blow it up."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'd still breastfeed, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I got my milk.
The riddle is a little crazy, but that's his purpose.
It's a great product," written by a user.
"It's pretty fun," said another, "to the mothers that make milk (they have to work in the country or in common), for they feel like "behi"."
He did not intend to praise or judge milk-industria."
At the end of the video, women show that they've been dancing about having milk in their breasts.
It is considered that many women out of milk feel as if they were cows in the campaign.
But the Elvie's milking is quite silent, and he has no cable or tutters. It can be carried discretely on one of the breasts of the orifice, so that the women can move as they please, have little children in arms or get out of the street.
The creator of the Mother of Ana Balarin and the executive director remarked, "The Militation of the Church is a revolutionary product, and therefore he wanted a bold and provocative presentation.
With that formality between women and milk-betters, we wanted to highlight the milk-pity and all its challenges, and in a manner express the freedom which gives them to milk and milk.
It's not the first time Elvie brought attention to milk.
In the week of Moda in London, a mother with two children appeared a passer-by for the Marta Jakubowski designer, while he used the product.
Hundreds of children's silent emigrators have been moved into a canop shop-stoo on the edge of Texas.
The number of the enigrator children of the house has lately grown up much, though the less nearly the same watch on the monthly guards of the frontier has been, one of which is the reason that the rhetoric and policy of the Trump administration are hard, and it has been harder to carry children to the protectors.
Until now, the immigrant paper has been most protectors, but now they are afraid to give up the name of children to protect them, that they may lose the power of stopping in America.
The danger was increased in the June; for the Federal authorities said that those who wanted to be a protector, and that the other adults who lived in their house would have to send their fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration autorities.
In the course of the week, Matthew Albence, who was one of the U.S. immigrations and cattle' security officials, declared that they had been arrested by dozens to protect the minor age that had arrived before the Congressu.
This agency confirmed afterwards that the 70 percent of them had not a painful prescription.
"There are nearly 80 percent of those who live with them in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're following to find them," said Albence.
In order to process the situation of children faster, the officers have created new rules, according to which, after having captured children, they must appear under one month in court, and not at the end of 60 days at the command of the shelterers.
Many of them will appear in a call by the video conference to ask a immigration company for legal states.
If you decide that help is not suitable, they will be deported immediately.
The more time the children have passed in the trenches of guarding, the more the chances are to increase their anxiety and depression; and consequently the efforts of violence or escape may happen according to the reports which have been made on the system during the last few months.
The defenders of children say these uneasinesss are increased in great installations like Tornillo; for, as it is so great, there is more probability not to see children's affairs.
Besides, the children have said that if they lead to the canopard camp, they can get emotionally prepared or say goodbye to their friends, they can grow more trauma that they have already made.
Siria asked to get rid of the U.S.A., French, and Turkey's "speakers" immediately asked for them to get out of it.
In general assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Walid al-Moualem in foreign affairs, has appealed to the rebels of Syria to return to their home, though the war of the country was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the representative of the Prime Minister, has said that foreign forces are excluded in the land of Syria, under the pretence of fighting against terrorism, and that they will treat them as "asscience."
"They must get out of the country without any conditions," he said in the commission.
Moualem has said that the war against Syria is almost over, 360,000 people have died in this war from 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their houses.
She said she's still fighting in the sacred battle until we wash all the land of Syria from the terrorist groups and from the foreign presence of the law.
The U.S. has two thousand soldiers in Syria, most of all the credulous forces against the President Bashar al-Assad, and the Arabs of Syria advise and training.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the earth of the country which the war has destroyed.
As for the subject of the Refuxed, Moualem has said that there are suitable conditions to return, and has been attributed to some of the West countries by spreading the "the irrationalbeldur" that leads the refugees outside.
"We call the international community and the humanitarian institutions to make these comebacks possible," he said.
"They are politizing what is only a humanitarian subject."
The United States of America and the European Union have remarked that the help of rebuilding Syria will not be given until the Assad and oposition arrives in a political agreement to end the war.
The Russians and Turks have made a treaty to create a field of protection in the last refuge at Idlib, and if they think of diplomacy in the United States, it is possible to suscept the political conversation.
In this province where the Syrian forces aided Russia had been able to make an attack of high scales between Russia and Turkey.
But Moualem has said that the agreement has pure "endment", and has remarked that the military action will have yihadists, in between the warlors of the Al-Qaeda, who will be "deuse".
The courier of Staffan de United Mistura, expects soon the first meetings of the new meetings will be made among the members of the government and the opposition, to begin a constitution after the war, and to open the way to elections.
Moualem has established certain conditions in which the government of Syria should share in this assembly, saying that the work of the assembly must be limited to "the articles of the present constitution," and that no one else should enter.
Why Trump wins the second time
After this logic, Trump will win the rehearsal in 2020, if, as it is expected, many of the democratic audiences in the center of the world, a process of dissension or scandals will end their presidentship before they need.
That would be the most dramatic end of a countryman.
For the moment, the audience doesn't seem to be tired.
From 2014, the audience on CNN string of the largest watchman has been almost doubled until 1,05 million spectators are won, and the MSNBC string has been three-drived until 1,6 million.
Fox News, on his side, has 2,4 million viewers on that schedule, that is to say, 1,7 million up from four years ago, according to the companies of Niels. MSNBC string "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the greatest audience on TV by the cable and has got it to 3,5 million spectators at the nights that have happened.
"It's like a fire that attracts people, because we want to understand what happens," says Neal Baer, directing the "unvivor of the ABC" session.

Of course, as well as anything else in television, stories that come from Washington are about to abort the future of the law of immigrants, the family of immigrants can be reunited, and determine the health of the worldly economy.
Only the audiences of the Pribilegio have the chance to disconnect.
However, if you see a discussion of six hours above being informed about matters like Bob Woodward's "prepared" book to write "Fear" how he used the "Fear" book, Paul Manafort, an oyster jacket of 15,000 "Jacks" in Washington Post), and Stormy Danielsmp's "Stomia."
At least I'm not going to look at Super Mario again.
The executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars" says that to the changing characters and arguments of Trump's show (the nationalfutbol-liga), about Kim Jong-unipation, "'Reality gives you a sense of being a show, every day giving you something to consume."

When I met her this week with Fleiss, she was 26 degrees and was sunny in her house on the northern shore of Kauai, but she was in the house while she was filming MSNBC watching CNNN.
It was not possible to break out of television, especially now, that Brett Kavanaugh is to appear before the Commission of judicial power in the Senate, and that the future of the Supreme Court is suspended.
"When I was doing these funny events, people used to say that it was the end of West civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

External money is entering the bar at the most equal elections of the United States' legislature.
It is no wonder that in the 17th division of Pennsylvania the money is entering; for the congressu-distributions have been reordered, and consequently two titulars are fighting for the same chair.
The frontiers have recently been reordered in that district of Pittsburg, the Conor Lamb of the Democrat Party, who has acquired his seat in the special elections of another decrepit.
He has another titular, which is indeed Keith Rothfus of Republican party, who stands for the division of Pennsylvania 12.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the limits of the dissolution were manipulated against the constitutions for the Republicans.
17. This new distraction contest has caused a narrow competition for the finance of the bells in the main financial sources of the parties: the congression of the democratic Campanine (DCCC) and the national commission of the Republican Campina.
He became a popular Lamb name in Pennsylvania, because he had earned the special elections of 18. kongresu-distrisu-distrisu in March.
The chair was from a Republican in the past decades, and the President Donald Trump won the distraction with the advantage of the 20-point.
In the state of political states, the Democrates have a little advantage.
The United States consider punishing El Salvador for being for China, but then he's decided back.
The diplomats have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged to P, that Washington has hardly asked them to postpone.
Trumpe had a polite meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in 2017, and he was a hotel in Panama until the partners decided to throw the Trump organisation team.
The officers of the state's department decided to leave the American head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, following the new decisions to "Taiwan to be taken notice of, as Heather Nauert said a month ago.
However, the punishment was considered only to be done against El Salvador, who received 140 millions of dollars as assistance from the United States in 2017, others to control the traffic of narcotics, to support development and economy.
Among the Proposed penalties there are small cuts and specific bisa bisa, which would have been extremely injurious for the country of Central America, of its incongruity and murder.
As the intercomers advanced, the officers of North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference about security and economic prosperity which had intended to succeed a similar meeting in the previous year, and the immigrant took notice of the efforts of going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the principal officers of the administration had left it clear that they wanted to make a conference, and so they told El Salvador that the consideration of punishment was cancelled.
It is expected that Mr. Mike Pence should be parted in the conference half-responsible, as the administrator gives the meeting the important sign of the diplomacy.
The three American couriers have returned privately to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic, without message or punishment from Washinton.
One of the speakers of the White House of Bolton refused to make a statement about the details given by the three American officers had been discussed.
An analyst who has a strict relation to the administration, and has been confirmed by an analyst who has been anonymously spoken.
Learn history
Robert Mueller's report will soon be released by the report which Trumpe would have made him obstructive to justice; for there is many proofs of it in public view.
Besides, it's said that the Russian attacked the United States elections is also investigating whether the Trump campaign was accompanied by Mueller.
If the majority of the Congress are changed, Trump will have to give instructions to the voters again (and, if necessary, for some time to appear before a jury of his equals).
There are a lot of conditions to do, but I don't mean Trump's ribable collapse of del, not even of the European equivalent of Trump.
We must take our decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and determine how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to make a state coup against Hitler, if the West countries had supported him and accompanied the Munich carslovakis.
We failed, and we lost the chance of avoiding the slaughter of the years after that.
We have the history covered with points of this kind of reflexion which strengthens or delays the inevitable progress of democracy.
The US are at this moment at this point at such a point of reflexion.
What are we going to do if Trump is put out by Rod Rosenstein the general alternative fiscial fiskal, which controls what's going to happen with the Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been risked that this newspaper had recently suggested that the president had been recording his silence, and that the president was inappropriate for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times is wrong.
"How shall we answer if the whole investigation or the truth of the FBI has been asked about Brett Kavanaugh, or if he receives confirmation of the Judge of the Supreme Court, though they have been committed to him the credital accusations of the sexes and false testimony?
And above all, shall we vote for a Congressman who asks for Trumpi responsibility in the elections of the legislature?
If we don't exceed these tests, it'll be a red winter for democracy.
But I really think we will overcome them, based on the teaching I had in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechslovakia, and occupied the same Nazi regiment that occupied my embassy to Auschwi.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers feels positive in front of the Rapid Vienna.
They know that if the Austrians are defeated by Rapid Vigue, after a few weeks ago, the impressionable draw from Villarreal in Spain, they will remain in the best position of the European League G group.
For some reason that Graham Dorrans was a lesio that he couldn't make his first scene in the season until he came to Villarreal two and two draws, but the Rangers believe he can use it for better things as a tranpolin.
'It was a good offer, because it's a good enemy, Villarreal,' said the 31-year player.
"We acted in order to do something, and ended up obtaining a point.
Maybe we could have an opportunity to win the end, but it's a draw, if necessary.
The first half of them prevailed, and in the second we were master.
Thursday night is going to be very important for the European competition.
We hope to get three points, but it's gonna be difficult, because they've got a good outcome at the last game, but the audience's on our side, and I think we'll get a positive result.
The year I left was difficult, I had lessons, and the club was changed, but at the moment there's a positive atmosphere.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying a lot, and training is also good.
I think we'll go ahead and forget about the previous season and get success."

Lurrics and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died on Friday because of the earthquake and strong tsunami which the Indonesian Palu cities had suffered, and, as the agents say, the number of the dead will rise up.

The Federal fiscalship of New York wants to be sentenced to death for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the terrorist attack of the city of New York, the last time a sentence was established in the state of a federal crime in 1953.
Simply Saipov had used a truck in Home Depot's rent for the attack on West Manhattan Avenue Avenue in South Manhattan, in that October attack, carried all the footmen and bikers ahead.
To reason for the case of death, Saipov has killed the eight people, and to prove that he had wounded several people "will" gravely, according to the intention of the death penalty notice presented in the South of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible in both cases to put the sentence of death.
A few weeks after attacking, a great federal jury threw down 22 cases to Saipov, eight murders for the organized crime, which the Federal fiscalship uses in the case of the organized crime, and a party of violence and destruction by the motor-carriage.
The Prosecutor said that the attack must be "prepared and planned" because Saipov made "rudelity" and described it.
"Sayfullo Habibuaevic Saipov's actions caused the wounds, damages and losses to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Cleves of Nicholas, Ann-Laure Decadt, Daren Drake, Ariel Erj, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego, Daandromian Pagnucco," according to the notice.
They were the five Argentine tourists of the victims.
It's been a tenth time since the South Range of New York had run into a case of death.
Then the accused Khalid Barnes was accused of two drug-providers' murder, but at last he was sentenced to death in the September of 2009.
The last time in a federal case in New York was sentenced to death in 1953, then Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, to whom two years before the war had been accused of conspirating with the engagement of the Sobietar Union.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the legal documents, the Saipov uzbist had not shown any shock in the days and months after the attack.
The police said he didn't feel bad about what he did.
According to Salaming, Saipov told the authorities that the inspiration of attacking had been seen by the ISIS organization's videos in the mobile.
In the police terms he asked the hospital room to be marked as a flag for the ISIS organization.
As for the charge of 22 crime, he declares that he is innocent.
David Patton, who is one of the Federal defenders who are in charge of representing Saipov, said, "It's a great coincidence."
"In our opinion, instead of accepting the guilt of death's death-responsion of lifeless life, the decision of punishment will only take a long time of trauma," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team asked him not to ask for the death-fiscalers.
A member of the conservative party says that NIGEL FARAGE ought to take care of the negotiations around Brexit.
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilize the population's army in the conference of the conservative party today.
The former leader of the VARP has said that the politicians need politics to feel the heat of the euroeszeptics, and the parliamenters of the Theresa May proposed this to take care of their negotiations with the EB.
Since the conservative Peter Bone told Birmingham participators, the United Kingdom was "outstanding" already, if Mr. Farage was Mr. Farrexit's secretary.
But the conservatives have arranged a protest against Brexit in the city, and the lady May before him showed her a challenge, and the lines which she had entirely distributed are to be reconciled again.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue the Consultation of Chequers, but in between the Brexit's favours, the attacks of stay and of EB.
The Alice thinks she'll go on and try to make a deal with Brusela by leaving such reactions aside, and that she'll be forced to decide between her offer or the "caos" and the laborary.
Mr. Bone did in Solihull, as he told them about the part of the Leave Means Leave team, he wanted to be fired.
He also declared that he was going to share with Mr. Farage and that he ought to attend to the negotiations of Brusela.
"If he was a lawyer, we'd be out of here already," he said.
The parliamenter of Wellingborough said, "I will defend him, but we must fire Chequers."
And He said to himself, "We did not fight the wars of the world to serve anyone.
We want to make our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone dropped that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, "The British have changed the idea, and it is a lie that they want to stay."
She also went to the march to the party of the conservative party and to the Boejote, and explained to the reporters, "I have nothing to say but this, Madam Prime Minister, to the People.
"Chequers is not known amongstst the people, the opposition will not vote for him, nor is it known between our fellow-citizens, nor among our fellow-citizens, nor amongst those who shake the streets, and that they may win our elections.
Let Chequers hear it."
He corrected Mrs. May, and added, "First Ministers, to continue to work, must keep their word.
As Mr. Farage told them that they had a share in the show, the politicians ought to be obliged to compensate the heat, and to betray the decision they had taken in the Referendum of 2016.
"Now, our (jende) and this is a matter of confidence between our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray him, and we're here today to know that we won't let them come out with him."
He directed himself to the public full of mind, and added, "I want you to feel the heat of our political class which is about to betray a husband."
"We are mobilizing the army of the people that gave us our victory at Bumble, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is independent and proud of autonom."
Meanwhile, on the side of the situation, the center of the city was traveling through Birmingham before two hours of march.
A few remarks had been raised by the group-fashion of this weekend against Brexit.
Mr. Adonis, with the worker of the Kide, laughed at the conservatives as the security problems which they had at first with the application of the party.
"They are people who tell us that IKT systems can work properly, and in Ireland the full technology of Kanada plus chains, of unbounded friction, of unbounded trade" added.
"It's a great lie.
Brexit's no good," he added.

Bottas was very well at first, and he almost fired Hamilton to defend his place at the first two o'clock, and invited Vettel to attack his team.
Vettel went to the box first, and Hamilton had to get into the end traffic of the tropel, which should have been the right effect on the race.
A round of Mercedes came into the box again, and he followed Vettel, but after a quarter, Hamilton was confronted by him, for the intervention of Ferrari's guide had left him free to hold his position after a double movement of defending the third corner.

The team has worked a great deal in the majority," said Hamilton.
They were unconcerned.
President Donald Trump laughed at the Senator Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday show that Brettt Kavanaugh's candidate at the Supreme Court was charged by Christine Blasey Ford's letter that he didn't have a leak for the highlighting.
When he had spoken in the West of Virginia, the President did not refer to the testimony given by the Senate's Judicle Committee, but he said that everyone in the Senate is "bad, false, and liar."
"The only thing that can be expected, and that in the last few days you see the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate, you see people who are angry, you see that people are evil, false, and liars," he said.
"You see the lights and leaks, and say, 'Oh, I'm not.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember his answer?
Oh, no.
I didn't philt him."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't philt," he added, imitating the reaction of the senator.
The letter from Kavanaugh came to Ford who sent Feinstein in the July, and was filtrated in the iraile, but Feinstein refused the leak in his office.
"I have not hid the charge of Dr. Ford; I have not the story of it," explained Feinstein to the Committee, as the Hill newspaper has been told.

But he had not been welcome to the president for denying it, and he declared that on the day of the Saturday it was celebrated, "What shall I say to you, those who were unavoidable gestures?
Maybe it wasn't him, but those were the most unprecedented gestures I've ever seen."

An air controler died of hundreds of flights of a plane to get away from a quake
A air driver of Indonesia has become heroes to ensure that a flight of hundreds of travelers had been taken to air and died.
No more than 800 people have died, and many more have disappeared after a great earthquake has shaken Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused a tsunami.
There have been a great deal of burning in the field, and many of them are stuck under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the colleagues had left their lives to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and to leave Sitiara Al Jufri Airport Paluport's control point.
At the same time Batic stopped to make sure the 6321 flight of air was on the way to air, which was now on the track.
After that he jumped from the control tower when he saw that he was going to collapse.
He died in the hospital later.
By Yohannes Sirait, who is the voter for the indonesian air navigation, the decision was saved by hundreds of lives, as the ABC News site of Australia has been informed.
We prepared a helicopter of Balikpapan in Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Too bad he left this morning before he got to Palura helicopter.
"Our hearts are broken when you hear it," he added.
Meanwhile the authorities fear that the rate of death will go up to a thousand persons, and that the table of Indonesia, of the Indonesian management of the Terdamendi, is a limited entrance to the people of Sigi and Boutong.
"It is believed that the sea will still grow, for many bodies are still under the ruins, and we have not been able to get here many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who is the speaker of the table.
Mostly the waves of about six yards have been destroyed by Palu; on Sunday, there will be a mass burial.
The military plane and the Business are bringing help and supplies.
The mother of Risa Kusuma 35-year-old told Sky News:
The clean water is small.
People steal all the food in small markets."
Indonesian the head of the International Cross, Jan Gelfand explained to the CNNN chain, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is as quick as possible to help those who survived, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia came to Palu on Sunday, and explained to the military officers of the country, "I ask you to do all the things that are related to you, that you may work all night and day.
"Are you ready?" he said, knowing the CNN chains.
This year another quake was struck by Indonesia, who was in the city Lombok, and died more than 550 persons.
Mikronese Air Niugini says now there's a man missing from a lake after a planeist.
The airline that fell into a lake of the Mikrones of Paphia, now says a man is gone, after he has said that the 47 passengers and the tripulations were sinking the plane properly.
As the Air Niugini said at a publication, he could not make sure that he was missing a man's traveler until Saturday afternoon.
As the airline said, he's meeting with local authorities, hospitals and researchers.
The airline did not immediately reply to the reporter's details (like age or nationality) about the passenger.
Thanks to the spot vestibule, the rest of the passengers and the crew were able to rescue that he was going to land on the Chuu Island Airport after he fell into the water.
As the officers said Friday, they took seven people to the hospital.
As the airlines said, there were six travelers still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in the situation.
What caused the accident, and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
As the airlines and the U.S. army said, the plane fell into the lake near the track.
Some testigu thought the plane had passed the tracks.
American Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
As Jaynes said, he and other passengers came easily to the bottom of the air of the air that reached the emergency courses of the plane.
He said the cabbagefaths were afraid and they were quarreling and he had a little wound in his head.
The army of the United States said that the aid of fishermen who were in the field of the quay had been very helpful in the rescues, so that a puzzzling boat was used to land before the flight of the passengers sank 30 feet (100 feet) into the water.
According to the net data of the aviation Safety network, 111 people have been killed in the last two dozens of the airline accidents registered in PNG, but none has been due to the result of the Air Niugini.
An analyst completes the chronology of the night a woman burned alive
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday on the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a woman of Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, who is an analyst of the US Justice Department, testified for several hours as an alody witness of the intellectual analysis.
As he proposed to the jury, he used the cell phone records in Quinton Tellis 29-year-old accused and the victims of Jessica Chambers during the night that the woman died.
As Rowlett said, the woman died in the evening, he received the positions of many mobile phones that tellis Chambers that show she was with, so he lied before Tellis, according to the The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
As the data showed, the phone of Tellis was with the Chambers at Tellis at the time when Tellis said that his friend was with Michael Sanford; then the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the judge on Saturday, and he testified that it was not in the village that day.
When the prosecutor told Tellis was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, "The mormimic was in Nashville."
There was another incoherence- Tellis said he knew him two weeks ago when Chambers died.
But according to the mobile phone records, they only met a week ago.
As Rowlett said, after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the text messages from Chambers, the calls and contact information from the phone.
'He took it away from life,' said Hale.
Defenses will start on Sunday with the latest homemen.
The judge has said that this day he will be sentenced to the jury.
High Breed, what's conscious hiphop?
A three-third who play hyp-hop music challenges people who have a negative opinion of the kind of music, and so they will keep their music with positive message.
"The High Breed Team of Bristol says that hip-hop music has left the political messages in its principles and the struggle of social affairs.
They want to go back to his roots and get the conscious hiphop again known.
Some artists, like the Fugees and Common, have lately seen the resurrection of such a hiphop, through the United Kingdom, Acal and Lowkey artists.
Another nigger?
A teenager in New York accused a couple of people for being kicked out after a "razist" message
A nurse in New York accused of a pair of discriminating and excusing him was no fault for him and saying that he was another black man after he received a message from his mother.
The couple refused to be racist, by saying that the charge is "precessive".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised to take care of the children, when Giselle Maurice knew that it was black when Maurice came home on his first day of his work.
'EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEACS,' wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
When he saw that in New York Post, he felt "deseroso," Plasco-Flaxman, and fired off from Miss Maurice, a child-maid, who was an afro-merican, was not a good workman and, instead, expected a filipinian baby.
Mlle. Maurice paid the one day of his work, and asked Miss Maurice for a Uber to bring him home.
Now Maurice has accused him of a couple, and he has asked for the compensation of the damages committed by the street, the other by the six months of the day of $350; for though he was unprovided, he was at the beginning that he was hired to live there for six months and to take care of it.
"I want to show them that things are not done," he explained to the Post Journal on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refused to be racist, and he said that Maurice was reasonable and necessary to get rid of him, because he was afraid they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco explained to the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person whom you have insulted, though it was a mistake?
Your born little baby?
No way."
When Plasco explained that the charge was "no", Plasco said that his wife had been short of two months ago, and that she was "in difficult state."
"Are you going to look for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," added the investment banker.
The case of the law is still running, and the court of public opinion has been accused quickly by punishing each other by his position and logic.
They were afraid that the publisher of Paddington would not like a bear that talks to readers, as a new letter showed them.
The daughter of Bond, Jankel, who had accepted the book, and after a while had been born, said in the letter, "It is hard to put it in the place of someone who had read it before he opened the book.
It is very amusing to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
Father BBC was a cameraman in the BBC for a small toy bear who had been an inspiration to write the book for the children, as his daughter said that the people had been optimistic about his work, and added the 60th of the book's release.
As for Paddington, he says that he was a family member, and that his father was proud of success at last.
"He was silent, and he wasn't vain," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he almost felt it as if he were a child who gets something-you feel proud of him, even though your achievement was not in itself.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
Even though it was the creation of his imagination, Paddington's merit which he always confessed to himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to her on the telephone.
As soon as the land was taken, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Niza, but the doctors could not do anything to save her life.
"Nad used to call it a trick to say that he didn't think he was going to leave," said Mrs.
"After that, I got a call from Nad to tell him that he would die in the next two minutes and that I was going to greet him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors had given him to beat his heart by the medicaments to exhaust him, and gradually leaving his system.
He died a little earlier than he thought, and then he ended up.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing everything would start there.
I could not cry out, for I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold it."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had since been distressed by her daughter's death, went up to the air with the rest of her travelers, forgetting her grief.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I had my head bent down, and my tears went down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but at the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him."
Some of the upset women put bills on a bridge to prevent people from killing themselves.
Two women who have lost their lives because of the suicide, want to avoid more people's being saved.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have signed bills on a Gales bridge, these posters are positive messages and phone numbers, so that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, who was 13 years old when he began to be depressed, and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I want every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, as he said, for cooking which his son had a special gift, and he had a pollutive smile.
"They all knew him because of the laugh.
His smile was always saying that he was clearing any place."
But before he died he had left a job, 'in a dark spot.'
In 2014, the brother of Tyler's 11-year-old man found his brother, after he took away his life.
Mrs. Davis said, 'I don't care if it's a domino-eficit.'
Mrs. Davis created a few signs, 'that the crowd may tell you what happens to you and the people who can help you, even though they're a friend.
Don't shut up, you must talk."
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time;
"He didn't say he was sad, not even depressed," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we sensed that he had changed his attitude.
He was buried on Christmas Day; when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they must go on, "He leaves a vision in his family.
He lets us fall.
But we all must go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a rock after the Bureau investigation has begun
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked, as a limited time, or an investigation of limited ranges, perhaps we could get a little union," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he added that the Committe was afraid of being "disposed."
Why didn't the FBI want Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers to investigate the case?
The opposite opinion is for time.
There are only five weeks left to the elections of November 6, which are expected by the Republicans to succeed bad results, and they will, if they do, begin to be weakened by the race of going out to the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush made many telephone calls to the senators, and made a pressure for Mr. Kavanaugh to protect them; for Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and he recognized his wife, Ashley, who was a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has made his report?
It will be thrown into the Senate, where 51 is the Republican and 49 Democrata are placed at this moment.
It is not yet clear that Mr. Kavanaugh could have at least 50 votes in the Senate, if it were, the President Mike Pence could break a draw and present it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea made "down" since Kim is in power
The number of people running from North Korea down to Korea since Kim Jong-un took the power seven years ago, as a legislator of South Korea has said.
Park Byeong-seug, making mention of the data of the South Korea Union, said that 1,127 had been fugitive in the previous year, compared to the fugitives 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the controls between North Korea and China have been strengthened by the controls of the frontiers, and the government of the person-firators had a great influence.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Almost all the fugitives of North Korea offer the citizenship of South Korea sooner or later.
Seul says more than 3,000 North Koreans have crossed the frontier since the war of Korea was over in 1953.
Most of them escaped from China; it has the longest limits of North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the demilitarized area between two numbers which are severely secured (DMZ).
China considers fugitives illegally impigrators, and not as refined, and often refuxed by force.
North Korea and South Korea are still in war with itself, the relationship between them has been highly improved in the last few months.
At the beginning of a month the leaders of the two countries joined Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations about the dissembling.
In June, the president of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un's historical meeting happened in Singapore, where there was no nuclear penintsula coroner.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, a minister of the Outer Afer of North Korea, accused the Americans that he hadn't made any progress from the hour.
"If we don't trust any of the United States, we won't be trusted in our national security, so we won't leave our weapons first," said Mr. Ri in a speech from the United States of New York.
Nancy Pelosi told him Brettt Kavanaugh is "histeric," and that he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, who is the leader of the minority of the Ganbera, told him that Brettt Kavanaugh is the president of the Supreme Court, and that he is not ready for the genius to be in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on a conversation that was done on Saturday at Austin's (Texas) during the Texas Tribune festival.
"I couldn't prevent thinking that if a woman ever had behaved like this, you would have said that "hissis," Pelosi said, "that was the reaction that Kavanaugh had passed before the Judizial Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh refused to attack Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both teenagers were teenage.
At the beginning, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he began to shout and to whistle as he spoke of his family and youth.
Even he accused them with specialty of the demoricrats of the Committee, and he said that the reparations against him are Hillary Clinton, who are angry with the elections of the 2016, and that they are the "scribing and insulting."
As Pelosi said, the testimony of Kavanaugh shows that he cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has an inparticial opinion against the democrata.
"With these affirmations and his attitude against Clinton and the democrata," he said, "he's left for livre."
Pelosi objected if he chose Kavanaugh, and if the majority of the delegates were to be asked whether he would resist him.
"If he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court, not to be in the court at this moment," said Pelosi.
At this moment, Kavanaugh D.C. is a court judge for the appeals.
As a democrata Pelosi has added, Kavanaugh is concerned about the judgments he will do against the law or the roe v.
At the Revocation Office, Kavanaugh avoided questions when they asked him if he would turn back some decisions from the Supreme Court.
"A personal and independent person cannot go to the court and expect us to be well," said Pelosi.
And women have to command.
It is a provoking speech, a terrible rage of months and years, and it cannot be released without crying.
"We weep when we get angry," said Miss Steinem after 45 years.
"I don't think it's strange, do you?"
"A woman who was an executive at any time helped me very much, and told me she was doing it when she was angry, but that she had developed an technique, when she began to cry, and she said to the person who was talking to her, 'Because I am weeping, you can think I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I thought it was a great idea."
They're not bad to see you, because they're misunderstood.
I remember clearly something happened to me at one of my first jobs. Most of them had been in a office where I was once crying with rage, and an adulter woman seized my neck.
"Don't ever let him see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understand you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Decrator of Koorad, and he worked with Gary Hart on his way to his presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Monkey Business, and his wife was not in love with another woman, and when Miss Schroeder had refused the race, she decided to be the same candidate for presidentship.
"It wasn't a good decision," she said, laughing after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone called you and seven dwarfs.
The camp was already beginning to collect the money after him, so he decided he wouldn't be in the race until two million dollars were gathered.
The fight was lost.
He knew that some of the followers who gave him $10,000 had only $250.
"Do they think I have a matter?" he asked himself.
When he had given a speech, and announced that he would not make an officer campaign, he was deeply moved, and he protected the good thanks to the people, for the sake of money and representatives, the frustration of the system that made him so difficult, and the anger of the sexist attitudes.
"You would have thought I was very nervous," explained Miss Schroeder, with the reaction that the press had seen his attitude.
"You would have thought Cleonex was my saver.
I remember thinking about this, what will they write in my grave?

The commercial war between the United States and China would be profitable to Pekin
The savings that determined the beginning of the commercial war between the United States and China were humming, and though there is a vital conflict, it may be possible that the racial races of countries should be brought to the advantage of Pekin, as well as the experts say.
The president of Donald Trump, the first warning that had been thrown out at the beginning of the year, then he gave up a tax to the principal products of China, the other, the sun panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant upload has arrived this week, the new rates which produce the product of $200,000 a thousand thousand francs will be applied to the half of the merchandise which will be transported from China to America.
Pek has applied them with things every time, and the last tarifa has been uploading to the American merchandise worth 60 thousand million dollars.
China has said he will equal every climb of the United States, and he will not easily change the secondary economics of the world.
The demand to postpone to Washington would bring them to court, but publicly to surrender to the United States would be more disgraceful for the Xi Jinping that is the President of China.
However, the experts say that if Pek is well done, the pressures of the commercial war of the United States might be benefited by China for a long time, because the independence of the two States would be reduced to destruction.
"The policyrieries of Washington or Pekin would make haste to make an economic lacquisition in some of the two countries. This is more dangerous than the observers thought it was before," said Clifford Grace, who, with many other experts who investigated Asia in the New Security Center of the United States.
