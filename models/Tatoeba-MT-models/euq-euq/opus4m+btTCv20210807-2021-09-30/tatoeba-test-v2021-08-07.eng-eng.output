I realise that this is not likely to happen.
Tom could have finished it by 2:30 a.m.
Tom could get hurt if he tried to.
Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom will try to do that.
I really love to travel!
I am sure Tom would be interested in investing in such a project.
Hopefully, inork ez gaitu ikusiko.
