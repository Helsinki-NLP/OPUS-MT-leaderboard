Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
Crowds are drawn to the Holy Masses he celebrates for release and healing.
He was about a dozen years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
For Masses celebrated by Fr Witko for release and healing draw crowds
He was once approached by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Józef Witko prayed over him.
Later that day, the boy was rushed to the hospital for surgery.
Astounded doctors said: "Operation is not needed, the cavity is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary activities of the Creator as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awake at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body started to change.
I lost my human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't get his voice out.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...", he recounts.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a calling in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did not just want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
In the masses for healing celebrated by Father Witko, many people participate, who count on getting rid of the disease.
The clergyman emphasizes, however, that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September this year) the Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of LOTTO's 3rd round of the Table Tennis Superliga.
Jaroslawians in such a personal comparison as they presented with the bulkheads, have little chance of winning against the rulers of the league.
This was clearly shown by a duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, hailed as the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the lineup, the Yaroslavians would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han may not have yet grown up to win against such tusas as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is Mark Badowski.
The contestant from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class to themselves.
After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five-hundredth battle – Pavla Sirucka.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Leia a chance.
One could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not live up to Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why not?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski's announcements, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was ill-chosen.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to exacerbating the difficulty of access to NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a falsely positive test result," the authors wrote.
The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we have foreseen it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then later they will go to the doctor, which is absurd, because the point is to lead to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," stated Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that expert specialists say: Let's not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor's office, and if such specialists advise the government, then I am not surprised that there is a health service in such a state," added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreements he made with Israel if the country's future government tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future Israeli government, as it emerges, proceeds to implement this plan, we will nullify all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened with pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - little matter what the consequences will be - by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was again given the mission to form a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won it, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat at the time, signed a number of peace agreements that the United States patronized.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a general election in Palestinian lands during the session of the UN General Assembly.
The last took place in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers vested in the "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions."
The Palestinian leader concluded the speech with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with all the United Nations provisions."
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership."
Danon, however, as the agencies note, did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators at critical points
A story from the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Regional Emergency Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be placed in the critical points of the city.
For their attitude, officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August, they served on the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs-Treasury Service noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, was called by the Communist Party secretary from her home village on September 23 to report that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all covered in blood," the woman says.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of police officers around who didn't get close to Wang."
Police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died of an "unhappy accident".
105 million PLN for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR were the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows users to transfer data; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using a novel model of gameplay based on the interaction of the virtual world with the virtual industry.
The objective of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers sector on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"GameINN's specially prepared research agenda and already reaching PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sector program provide a significant impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", reads the release.
The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The incentives introduced by the government for innovation-oriented entrepreneurs, such as R&D reliefs, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR, drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than the year before.
"The amount of deductible costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave over PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN," emphasises the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that in the two previous grant competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.
The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly gratifying that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects on solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector program is implemented as part of the Intelligent Development Operational Program.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The incident occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who came from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane did not show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was puzzling from the start.
Footballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadig finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane to return the money for his watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
He came to Nice when he was thirteen years old, and three years later he made his debut in the first team.
He played seven games this season.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but, according to the newspaper L'Equipe, the club is likely to dissolve him with immediate effect.
For the time being, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his competitor.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
See if you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
Most of us wash them for less!
All it takes is warm water and plain soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
Washing, we rub not only the undersides and the tops of the hand, but also: the tips of the fingers (combined or individually) – rub them with circular movements against the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (interlace the hands, rubbing the fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb is covered with the other hand and in such an embrace we spin it a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you cannot wash your hands) you should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the washed handles or doors (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them through a paper towel.
Iran's President Says He Rejected U.S. Talk Proposal, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not engage in talks with the U.S. side during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, the Americans proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile construction program.
Rouhani: Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he did not agree to take up these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He stated that he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the urgings of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the U.S., and accused the European parties of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a prerequisite that does not allow" for dialogue.
If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the past week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side's request.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said no!" tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 Iran deal to which they were signatories.
It stated that in return for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector would be put under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing has come of it.
Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iran's oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

Judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and husband of the hater Emilia, who – according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp – participated in stalking against judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: no disciplinary action has been initiated against him, and so there is no basis for maintaining the order of Wojciech Mazur, president of the WSA, to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, initiated an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must address the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly told about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who due to suspicions of participation in the hater group was removed from the KRS office, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for the faked screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.
That is exactly what the other judges associated with the "Castle" claim: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll put their own way.
Because the prosecution did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people whom they had indicated as stalkers in a February report by Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, there is no Kasta case.
Nor is it the case of NIK chief Marian Banasia about renting the tenement to the pimps and hiding the income.
The CBA checks his property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Committee on Deputies' Ethics will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control somehow gathered to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banasia's deputies and appoint as acting lawyer, although the law of such a bizarre combination does not provide).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with a mistress in bed.
She is so astonished and devastated that she cannot utter a word.
She stands in the doorway speechless, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is this?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?
Only in the case of "Castle" or Banasia there is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final jump up
Earlier this season's return to competition after the maternity break, the bronze medalist of the 2017 London World Cup, in the first attempt she defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 was only achieved in the third approach.
"I'm happy.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically," Lićwinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the eliminations, the best were the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karyna Demidik – after 1.94.

The women's high jump finale is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in severe condition
He went to the hospital, and the doctors describe his condition as severe.
It must be added that he is conscious and conscious.
"We believe he will come out of this, that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover," said an anonymous close person, Kornel Morawiecki, in an interview with the journalists of the "Super Express".
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My immediate family and politics are keeping me alive," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview two weeks ago, which he gave to the journalists of the "Super Express".
In January, the "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for research.
"I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I reported to the hospital.
It turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father reported.
A few days later at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went well.
"I know a lot of people prayed for me, which I thank very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know yet if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy.
I put myself in the hands of medical professionals who are rather good-natured.
For now, after this hard surgery, I have to go back to some state of use.
I hope that everything will be okay," Kornel Morawiecki noted in January in an interview with the "SE".
"If I had given up the examination too late, then the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to that bully by now...", he added.

When she was last seen, she was wearing a sweatshirt, gray pants and shoes.

The power of Oława jumps.
The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September on the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.
For the road to true power is a long way away, but that is the name given to one of the types of horse-riding competition...
The competition for the power of jumping consists in the rider and horse overcoming ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth noting here that the long and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Oława, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is not the worst either...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "W saddles", were a show part of the "Rainbow equestrian competitions" played there a little earlier, which we write more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons entered the competition, training riding in the Oława JKS.
Four competed on ponies and four competed on large horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra performed best, riding the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but very dynamic rummage started by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three consecutive refusals that he was removed from further competition by the competition jury.
Second place in the jumps of the ponies was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famy", and third place by Lena Boruń on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest contestant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the competing amazons and spectators during the competition involving large horses.
Terrible-looking falls were scored by Paulina Szewczyk, riding the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on the "Lotka".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the park.
It took either an assistant coach or another horse to pair up, which was followed by a bit of a crazy "Wineta".
After passing the obstacle from the park, she also rode down full throttle, so sometimes in boxing and at the expansion room it got dangerous. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a bit with those frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska, riding beautifully presenting "Whisky", did a great job in the park.
This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, the second approach in the final phase was the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that point.
After a while, however, the same height was also credited to Paulina Szewczyk on the "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on the "Winet" and Anastasia Abramenko on the "Lotka".
To decorate the flo and to receive the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment all these contestants went together, and at the end together with the amazons on the ponies in the tact of Radecki's march they performed an impressive round of honour, ending with it these interesting and exciting competitions.

Max Kolonko Cuts Off KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which the #R Revolution political formation of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the election, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, however, none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko himself failed to even collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko reported on Twitter that he ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I will expect the above mentioned KWW to remove my name from the name.
I kindly ask that you do not include me with the aforementioned entity", he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On 4 July, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, staying in the US, announced the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
"We've had enough politicians, we've had enough of your stupid games, we've had enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolonko said at the time.
The party's agenda included, among others, issues concerning the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (alignment of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to NATO's eastern flank states, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-mandate constituencies.
A few days after the new political formation was announced, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately happened.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium point
"The euro rate will remain around the 4.35 PLN ceiling in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets," announced Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising the zloty's quotations at the current ceiling", the specialist assesses in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the pronounced inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks soften policy.
"While the zloty is properly valued – the euro quotations should persist in the coming months around the 4.35 PLN ceiling – Polish bonds are not attractive according to him.
Much more profitable yields than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in the company of UBS Wealth Management.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the economic downturn in the world.
"The global slowdown may yet deepen, but there should not be a severe recession, or at most a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should underestimate the global stocks that may be harmed by the lack of prospects for resolving the U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively least," according to the latest letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management's chief executive, Mark Haefele.
"Actions from euro area countries should behave worse than the US because they are more vulnerable in conditions of heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down," the document said.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the bull market in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the German 10-year yields even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the long run, the profitability of long-term, and only short-term, securities should no longer fall due to the banks' monetary easing.
The Fed has the largest field for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.
The long-term balance point for the euro quotations is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed's rates, which will result in a decrease in monetary policy differences in the world.
"The long-term strength of the dollar may not be allowed by current and budget deficits," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehra loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of Defence
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential list drawn up in the defense ministry of Germany.
The information was given by the press belonging to the media group EditorialsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office of the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defense Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been re-tracked so far.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 all-purpose machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols, and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The situation was voiced by Left Party vice-president Martina Renner.
As she told RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "terrifying".
All the more so because as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "miserable balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that the list did not indicate whether there were any weapons found there during the investigation against Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a severe act of violence threatening the security of the state and of violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations of leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.
His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights advocate and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally came into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 50 explosives.
Crying children on a plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently applied a feature designed for people who find traveling in the company of a crying child a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the schedule of seats on the aircraft.
If a given call is traveled by a minor until the age of two, the "child icon" appears in a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the carrier's services has the opportunity to choose a place away from that occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported on the imperfections of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change of aircraft.
As you might expect, the idea divided Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be kids, too.
"We need to learn tolerance because we're going to need a map of sitting places for mouth-breathing, drooling or drunks soon," wrote user G Sundar.
Another internet user noticed that he had once been disturbed by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me of screaming children on a 13-hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca Counts Losses After Travel Agency Bankruptcy Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
Marc Pons, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take a leave of absence in Majorca in October, said on Friday that there were also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company were German and Scandinavian citizens.
However, according to Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during the November-April period, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators about "entering the Majorcan market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are dismissed employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional nightly fee.
This situation was experienced by, among others, dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Islands government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had ceased operations at least by the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.
Friday's Diario de Ibiza newspaper, on the other hand, indicates that most hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group are not intended to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with an amount of 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the declaration of bankruptcy by travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Government of the Balearic Islands, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 about 5 million euros.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in the lead
The women's national team of Poland ranks 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous July ranking.
Weak staff matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders remained the American women, who recently defended the title of world champion.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, while the third place was held by the Dutch.
The Polish women are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start with an away match against the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting it was – due to food poisoning of the opponents – postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate the qualification with a meeting with the Spaniards on 12 November in Lublin.
Previously, "White-Red" will play two friendly matches – on October 3rd, on a trip with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the rivals of the Poles are the representations of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and the top three teams from second places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the playoffs for the last three passes to the European championship.
The stake of 16 participants will be completed by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog has crushed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air program are slim, and the coal furnaces will kick this winter as if nothing ever happened," reads the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
"So far, 82,000 applications for a grant totalling PLN 2 billion have been submitted as part of the «Clean Air» programme, of which 48,000 decisions were positive.
Accepted applications amount to a total of over PLN 915 million", reports "Rz", citing data from the spokesperson of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced hype program are rated by the journal as "modest".
Local government officials, quoted by the "Rz", see the failures of the "Clean Air" in, among others, too much bureaucracy.
"The program should be much simpler: electronic application, sending invoices by mail, possible random execution control.
This would improve operations", says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
In turn, activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation, less than 1 percent of the assumed goal of replacing 3 million mound boilers was achieved.
As noted by "Rz", although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. annually PLN 10 billion, this amount is virtual.
"The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year was reserved only 1.4 billion PLN", we read.
Congress Agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
"This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but it is not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price," added the Polish minister.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish air force will power 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department approved their sale to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to State Department information, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract would also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics support and program and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine multi-purpose fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombings and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, F-35 fighters bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s with them.
The purchase of U.S. fighter aircraft is also to be considered by other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gendered Dolls
Producer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
He wants to fight stereotypes in this way.
Manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
Next to Barbie of different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
The toys in the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie is to have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
Gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist, or – in the case of Ken – wide shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," announces Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in swimsuits and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes" such as, for example, the unnatural proportion of the body.
The company reacted to the criticism and had already introduced dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes, to the market.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: wheel or club Together can have a dozen MPs
Zandberg, when asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing parties (KW SLD from which the list is run by candidates to the Sejm of the SLD, Spring and Left Together, running with the common logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people associate hope with the fact that the Left is not only right, but also has strength," he noted.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 MPs.
"This may mean that the club or club together will have a dozen or so MPs.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by different, we were able to agree on a common program."
When asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start was SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries were centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, the SLD would get the entire subsidy, he replied that "the goal of the political party is to represent its constituents".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates in this offer to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further away," he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District 44, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district," he stressed.
"I don't think I'd be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO candidate - PAP)," he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are competing.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of the huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, capable of accommodating 30,000 worshippers.
The facility was built by the Mooride Brotherhood, part of the Sufi Islamic mainstream that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, donated by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the fraternity, venerated by the followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will accommodate 15,000 faithful, and the other half may be on the outer esplanade.
In richly finished interiors, you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice is still no match for mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 people.
The construction of the mosque, which cost over 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, has funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, it is ourselves
A pass of eight league matches without a victory, the Crown footballers will try to stop in Friday's meeting with the runner-up of the Śląsk Extraleague.
"Our problem is not the Wrocławians, it is ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized the Kielce coach Mirosław Smyła.
Crown players last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round, when on the away they defeated 1:0 beniaminka of the Raków Częstochowa competition.
Later, the Kielceers recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in 1/32 of the final of the Polish Cup.
"It gives me optimism that in the final seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, it was only a fall of anger because they were so close," Smyła said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.
In Friday's match in the Crown he will certainly not play pausing for excess yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, in the frame he will also miss injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
On the other hand, it is building to apply in a cup match of several players with a desire to play.
"We have a headache, recently it seemed that he would be gone, and now he is," Smyła stated.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the extraclass everyone can win against anyone.
"We are a good team.
In recent weeks, we may not be showing it on the field, but the moment will come that we will be winning and we believe it will be on Friday," he said.
After nine rounds of the Crown's extra-class with five points, he takes the 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks second.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees may completely disappear from Europe
"42 percent of the tree species that make up Europe's stand are at risk," warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and rowanberry.
The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was compiled by specialists who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the causes, the Red Book lists rapid urban agglomeration growth and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
When it comes to typically European tree stands, according to IUCN specialists, 58% of species are at risk, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the operation of the stand, accelerated urbanization, too intensive logging, and, subsequently, forest fires and changes taking place in the European ecostism.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also at great risk.
"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of extinction of important and underappreciated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them for their freedom to distribute on credit, which future generations will have to pay off," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PiS to pic".
At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away".
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot boxes.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczynski's party.
"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than proponents of PiS, a party that has defied the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency," Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.
"First of all, nothing that is given will be received, but you have to set a direction for the future, because PiS only deals with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he stated.
Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work fairly - and those who are entrepreneurial".
Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among others, a project that will give the least earning Poles more about 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for a giveaway.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he will not promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the ruling parties were bidding with the opposition to the distribution, until finally the country's financial collapse occurred," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview with "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"Pride steps before falling.
Kaczynski is such a statesman as Banaś is crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether or not he will run for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Grand Condors
Six dead large condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as puma, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals could eat toxic carcass.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"It's a big loss to the environment because the condor has to reach 10 to 15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of the state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by the law firm of Andrzej Duda – we read in Rzeczpospolita.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Commonwealth.
It was probably used by President Ignacy Mościcki for the last time.
"Rz" reports that soon such a chain may hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions on Wednesday voted to work on an amendment to the Orders and Distinctions Act to bring it back.
Nor is this the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is instant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, considering that they would consult the President's Chancellery.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition," wrote then Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The President's Chancellery responded briefly: it is in favour of bringing it back," said commission chief Robert Mamatow of PiS, quoted by the "Rz".
He submitted a motion for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive across the intersection
Police action will be conducted at the intersection of Cieplinski Avenue and Piłsudski Avenue, among others.
Uniformed actions are somehow related to recent complaints by city authorities about drivers not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers start preventive actions in Rzeszów "Transient intersections".
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of a descent, failure to comply with light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, but we are actually making life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, the city's vice president, a few days ago.
His words were heard at the City Hall press conference, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster moving at traffic lights or not writing text messages while driving.
The subject was taken over by the Rzeszów police officers, who are starting the action "Transient intersections" from today.
What is it?
The aim of the activities is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the passability at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to the intensification of traffic obstructions and the formation of traffic jams.
He is threatened with a fine of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of driving fluidity, late movement from under the beacons, slow crossing of intersections, and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
At what intersections will the activities be carried out?
Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street with Jagiellońska Street; Ciepliński Avenue with Piłsudski Avenue; Targowa Street with Piłsudski Avenue; Śreniawitów Square with Dąbrowski Street or Hetmańska Street with Powstańców Warsaw Avenue.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpacie will be conducted on the following Fridays in October.
They inspected the waste disposal company from "Cajka"
"Officers of the Department of Environmental Protection of the County of Wołomiński and the District Construction Supervision Inspectorate checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which waste from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka" in Warsaw is disposed of," said the spokesman of the County of Wołomiński Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors from the Vologda county carried out an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The private commercial and transport plant "Dar-Trans", under an agreement with the capital sewage treatment plant "Czajka" performs sewage waste management services.
"An inspection of the installation was made, in addition, the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business activity", said Szyszko.
He added that the post-control report will be forwarded to the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw, among others.
The last inspection in "Dar-Trans" was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not perform sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater, and did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant.
After the WIŚ audit, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal in the excavation area, waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUŚ was shut down, which was related to the damage to one of the incinerators.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my total support," Lech Wałęsa told Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr. President, for me these are very important words," replied the Civic Coalition candidate for prime minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now "just a supporter in retirement".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre.
Wałęsa's son Jarosław also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You took on a difficult task," Lech Wałęsa said after the meeting.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are familiar to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you as a woman will deal with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible," said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for the support.
"Mr. President, to me these are very important words, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is," she said.
"Let us show that it is possible to make a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, in accordance with respect for others.
You did your revolution that way, and we want to change Poland that way," Kidawa-Błońska stressed.
A fan in retirement
Wałęsa said in an interview with journalists that he is now "just a supporter in retirement".
"Of course, I'm looking into it.
I hope we reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The tri-division of power is paramount, the constitution is paramount, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we have a street criterion," Lech Wałęsa said.
"That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the elections, think about it and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing," Kidawa-Błońska added.
"The last chance that we will improve the state of affairs as it is in Poland," the former president responded.
"We need to build a new foundation"
When asked about the most important changes for her, which should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The president said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which to do all the other things.
Since the tri-division of power does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it a matter of course and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move one step forward."
ME volleyball players: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
In the hot terrain in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with the Slovenians in the semi-final of the European championship.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the coach of Poles Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The "White-Reds" lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate passed without amendments the Act on the disclosure of the estates of the families of the most important civil servants and on the flights of the most important persons in the state.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the law on the estates of the families of state officials – without amendments – 14 were against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by the PO Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments had the act to "civilize" and limit the scope of information provided in the declaration about the property situation of children of their own, children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which children remain in the common household with a person obliged to make a statement.
The Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important civil servants, the project of which was created in the office of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The regulations stipulate that, among others, Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Senators, Presidents of: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons who are the head of other state institutions will be obliged to include in the property statement information about the personal assets of spouses, children and persons in common life.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.
The bill also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted for the bill – without amendments – 12 were against it, four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "executed in an official mission".
In the flights, the President will be able to be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
By contrast, the flight in the mission of the official prime minister and the marshals of the Sejm and Senate will only be a flight "taken to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed".
The law also specifies a list of people who can accompany the most important people in the state during the flight.

The Poles, after their first training in Paris, are waiting for their last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in a bronze medal match on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's caretaker way to win the title was closed by Thursday's defeat against Slovenia 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their trouble to travel to this duel.
This time they did without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they did training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the accounts of those present in the class, the world champion trainer was nervous.
As Assistant Heynen Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of volleyball elements alone.
"We went to the hall, but for the most part it was the time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We have been brutally brought to the ground.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We still believed we'd be back in that game.
We discussed this match with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure I would point out the ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of stress, associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted that the world champions could have sedated the smooth road to the semi-finals somewhat.
"Perhaps if we had a similar-style defeat in the group stage, we would have analyzed the lesson more quickly and then played in the later stages of the tournament differently.
But it's just a bum," he cautioned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat will be turned into aggression in the bronze match.
"I hope we show our true selves then.
There's something to fight about.
Recently, we won the ME medal in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
They competed in the group stage in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group stage meetings, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine – in a six-month suspension – for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks break plus a substantial fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a probationary period in which a recalcitrant athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been messing around for a long time and has earned a tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match against Karen Chaczanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play long, but he managed to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
Words about corruption, however, were forgiven, after hearing the guilty and learning the context of the speech.
However, in their justification, the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' conduct throughout the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious objections and was almost a constant violation of the rules, that he was constantly insulting people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the sentence, ordering several conditions to be met within the next six months: in ATP Tour tournaments and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, or behave indecently and in any other way.
He was also given a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also to consult outside the season with people specializing in problem-solving athletes not coping with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) to the verdict was, "Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as he suffered a shoulder injury in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).
Kyrgios ranks 27th in the ATP ranking.
He won two tournaments this year – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines, he will be left with a lot of money.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
The report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday shows that as good or rather good its financial situation was assessed last year by as many as 44% of them.
A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016 33.5 percent, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of household situations – it never exceeded 30 percent.
He considered a total of 8.1% of households to be bad or rather bad in his financial situation last year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20 percent in 2009.
The material situation of households of self-employed workers is the best.
In this group, over 70% of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.
At the other pole are the pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also heavily influenced by the number of children.
The worst is for single parents, of whom a good or rather good financial situation is declared by 32 percent.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst of its material situation was assessed by single parents raising offspring and large families (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
However, that is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of the voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best grades are formulated by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9 percent of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are further Lubusz Voivodeships (47.7 percent), Silesian Voivodeships (47.6 percent), Mazovian Voivodeships (47.3 percent) and West Pomeranian Voivodeships (47.1 percent).
Meanwhile, in Opole, the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average last year, and in Lubusk, it was 98%.
The highest incomes were held by residents of Mazovian (120 percent of the national average) and Silesian (104 percent).
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person was PLN 1,693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3 percent compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, this is a fairly low result.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3 percent.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits spending growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, spending per person increased in real terms by 1.9 percent, and in 2016 by 4.3 percent.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household now spends 70.1 percent of its disposable income, while still in 2014 this share exceeded 80 percent, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

US: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of that year, and the earlier suicide took place in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, third party involvement has been ruled out.
In addition, deaths are not to be related.
"We need everyone to get involved in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help," Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
Un-Soul critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"In fact, every sentence he made was accepted."
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
"For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk's harmful activity puts a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – was developing his media into the best during the lifetime of the Polish Pope," he explained.
Former PO politician admitted: "there were murmurs of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply expel him from the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
However, John Paul II did not do it, so did his successors," Niesiołowski explained.
"Besides, this fatal case of paedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather the lack thereof, has come to pass.
I ran a little ahead of myself, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church for a relatively recent time.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.
In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
"It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Mass, everywhere there were crosses.
Now these crosses are Pisan, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisan regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly," Niesiołowski argued.
"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type," he concluded.

The PZPN is punishing the stadiums for brawls.
Disqualified griffon
The clash between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk as part of the Polish Cup did not end tragically when the team goalkeeper Zlatan Alomerovici, fired by fans from Wejherowo raca by millimeters, passed.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case inflicted severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed into their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to leave in groups for league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the Widzew Stadium was also caused by fans of Śląsk Wrocław.
Here, however, the PZPN verdict was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Despite this, the services allowed the sector of Lodz fans to be hurled with races, set fire to chairs and forced the host sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
The PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited organizing trips to matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The ban on departures also included league matches of the Ekstraklasa, however it will last there until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the ordinance of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, writing down the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, changes will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from an amendment to the Minister of Infrastructure's regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of localities in neighboring countries often have a Polish sound as well.
Thanks to the change in law prepared by us, they will finally appear on signposts by our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the subcarpathian section of the A4 motorway", reported Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, changes will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand PLN.
In the first place, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned to be implemented by 1 November 2019.
What is the implementation of the idea supposed to look like?
It will be done without replacing the plates, on a sticker basis.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the localities with new ones, written in Polish on already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish and then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great facilitation for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windbreaker.
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had arranged a target from the animal – a shotgun shot was found in his body.
"He received information about the wounded bird from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sól.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of it.
There were shrapnel shards in his body," says Marcin Walasek, CEO of Malpol, which manages, among others, the rehabilitation center.
Winters at the resort
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water was provided, a safe place in the resort where he would spend the entire winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He's not able to fly yet.
Letting him go now would mean he probably wouldn't have survived the winter," Walasek adds.
The staff, after undergoing a swan rehabilitation, intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
After receiving information about the cause of the animal's ill health, the authorities of Żukowice municipality intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The incident occurred in Zameczno
Gowin: ‘we must stimulate Polish, small-scale trade’
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.
Gowin during a conversation in "Signals of the Day" in Radio Jedynka stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of the term, but got "counter-attack from the EC".
"We won before the tribunal of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will return to this subject," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore minor, trade".
"Over this, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was an unlawful public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act assumed the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 percent on income between 17 million PLN and 170 million PLN per month and 1.4 percent on income above 170 million PLN per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
She further stated that the danin had been implemented in an unlawful manner.
She also issued an injunction to suspend the tax until it was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
An EU court decision in May opened the way for a re-introduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the CJEU press service informed PAP that the case is currently in a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure will commence, that is, hearing the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good few to a dozen or so months from the appeal to the announcement of the verdict.
"Such proceedings take an average of one year," a source told the PAP at the Court of Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We suggest some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that the newly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look their best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will be comfortable as well.
In stores, you can find many outfitted sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks of toddlers were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same becks or big cushions.
Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older: several months, yearly, and even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a large comfort already needs a slightly different baptismal garment.
Therefore, if your child is three to four months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the celebration in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or godparents.
The best way to do this is to dress it in comfortable cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this piece of clothing is considered everyday clothing, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.
For the boy, a body with a print of bow ties and suspenders will turn out to be ideal.
In the case of older children, you can afford a greater fantasy in dress.
The girl will look pretty in a simple tulle dress
Many of the girl's parents are eagerly looking towards the richly decorated, ruffled baptism dresses complete with coats, headbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it is better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and charming sets will make your little girl look gorgeous and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, there was a trend among the boys' parents for suits that were copies of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or cashews often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their discontent.
Today, fortunately, they have been supplanted by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, which are soft, sweatpants shorts, and a blouse decorated in front with a vest pattern.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not constrain the movements of the world-knowing toddler.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a statement of property
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a declaration of property at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS MP accumulated 110 thousand zlotys of savings.
Recall that Pavlovich announced his departure from politics.
At the end of his term, he has the amount of 110 thousand PLN.
According to the statement made by the MP, she collects a pension of a monthly value of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz owns an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and slightly smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment for PLN 150,000.
Jarosław Kaczyński also published the property statement earlier.
Voting on recess for the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programming conference, which the government requested.
289 MPs voted in favour, against – 306.
It is customary for the House of Commons to sit during party conferences, so that MPs do not have to resign from either attending or sitting in parliament.
However, the opposition parties felt that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK's planned departure from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not be interrupted.
289 MPs supported the government's motion for a recess, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of consent to the recess can be seen as the political revenge of the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared unlawful and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the judges' ruling.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the most important event of the day being Johnson's speech and the ensuing tumultuous debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
"It's time for Brexit to come to fruition.
It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications Johnson gave for explaining such a long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," the foreign media wrote.
A spokesman for the president strongly denied these reports.
"It's just not true," Błażej Pushchalski tweeted.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and the "Jerusalem Post", citing the "Jewish Insider", write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish Consulate in New York declared that Israel was the one to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned an act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Pole, Pole".
"The quote is not just inaccurate.
It's just not true," Błażej Pushchalski tweeted.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".
According to the JI interlocutors, there was also a dispute during the meeting between a Holocaust survivor, decorated with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that it was the Jews of Israel "like Israel Kac" who are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach portal sources, he was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who is Banaś and what is his fault?
The tenement rented by the ceilingers led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We summarize another scandal that shook the ruling camp.
Journalists of TVN's "Superwizjera" revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, had not entered a 400-metre tenement house in Kraków's Podgórze in recent years.
Moreover, his sub-tenant was to run a sex business (and therefore rent rooms for hours) in the aforementioned tenement house.
In turn, the building itself was allegedly a loan repayment security from 2016.
The irregularities were pointed out by Bertold Kittel in the program "Supervisor".
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the tenement house was rented by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banaś responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the ceilingers led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The tenement itself was vaguely described in them, and the income from its rental was to be understated.
"The assets of Marian Banasia and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an audit of Marian Banasia's property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK by the time of its completion. "I will apply to the Marshal for free leave," he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.

Therefore, we are forced to hand out the state authorities and submit a notice of the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Mariusz Witczak, PO-KO MP.
"If a normal Pole had so grossly low a valuation of his properties, he would already have 10 checks, tax additions and criminal tax proceedings," he added.

"Republic": Ignoring a policeman's command will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a specific behavior order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, threatened with fines, arrest or restriction of freedom.
Such a change is wanted by the police unionists.
The idea went to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases go to Polish courts," the statement read.
The "Rzeczpospolita" determined that the petition which the Independent Policemen's Trade Union writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Misdemeanors.
It would read: "He who does not comply with the demand or command of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to the penalty of arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, by not following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of the official act," the journal says.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the recipe proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in matters of political manifestation.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and instead of mitigating the situation, they would exacerbate it," he adds.
Statistics released by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens gave a positive assessment of police interventions in 2018 and that every month, the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras worries about Europe
Ichym Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
Father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today exchanged in a single row with Vaclav Havel.
Thus, the curse of talent, which this one seeks to exploit, hung over J'chym from the beginning.
After eight years, he returned with a "Sensitive Man".
The protagonists are Buras and Soca along with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, travelling around Europe.
He's a Shakespearean lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth made no sound of himself, and for the other time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are merely a backdrop for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of clogged provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and promiscuous youth.
The "sensitive man" in places turns into an absurd theatrical.
The narrative mimics the didascalia, and the characters' conversations create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to bankruptcy Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is in operation.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems with bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with an office that has been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
As late as Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company is now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of the British parent company, which has caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassured that the customers who bought the tours in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
Creditors demanded that, in addition to the 900 million-pound rescue plan already agreed in August, the company obtain an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems had been building up for several years, resulting in a debt of up to 1.6 billion pounds.

Goerlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for reviews
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for the German visitors by the Gérlitz.
The actions are intended to help fight the progressive decline in the city's population.
Goerlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists annually.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.
The lowest wages in Germany are found in Goerlitz.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a 25 percent decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.
Two thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.
The programme was also attended by people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the program was supposed to convince people to move to Gorlitz," one of the project participants said.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the participants of the program.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, program manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
