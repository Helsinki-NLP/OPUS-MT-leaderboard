Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
There was consternation among some members of the National Assembly, as a result of a proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament (MPP).
The idea arose in connection with plans to convert the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP expressed concerns about his group, saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word "twp" means fool, and the word "pwp" means feces.
One Plaid Cymru party politician stated that his party was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to changing its name, but pointed out that the wording of the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The assembly committee, which is currently working on a bill to change its name, took the following position: "Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be theirs."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, and the renaming of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained wide support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" was the most popular among the public.
Members of the assembly propose alternative solutions, and the difficulty of reaching consensus is a nuisance for Elin Jones, the president of the assembly, who should be presenting the bill in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules for the dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
Next Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to help avert a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Orge Ivanov, the President of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the renaming, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that change is necessary to allow the state to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in New York's St. Martin's Church are closing in on the problems troubling churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There is currently no sign of them."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"At present, people are socializing in a different way," he noted.
"Bars are no longer a regular meeting place for community members".
In the case of churches, however, he worries that the proceeds from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as decision-makers believe, and that "they will be at the starting point sooner or later."
He added that churches could be replaced with apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the other nearby temples.
As he said, "The overwhelming majority of people buying housing in such buildings will be white, and this will accelerate the total closure of churches, as new residents are unlikely to become members of these parishes."
Both churches were built by a gathering of white believers, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The original white Methodist assembly left the district in the 1930s.
The surrounding African-American assembly then took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an assembly led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors on 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the hiring or promotion of African Americans.
The 1939 fire significantly damaged the building, however, John Howard Johnson parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell assembly.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who struck the bells in July described them in a different way, as a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be served by a black musician. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, a number of complicated events have occurred in St. Martin's Church with the participation of architects and performers, some of them brought to the place by the lay leaders of the church, and some of them by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish made up of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it "want to pass costs on to the council", although the council did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California
Authorities reported last Saturday that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the season on lobsters.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on a Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help.
As Hammel said, at first he thought the boy was excited about catching a lobster, but soon realized the baby was screaming, "I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Upon arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around his collarbone.
"I started yelling at everyone to run away from the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, and his condition was described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious upper torso injuries.
For the purpose of the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that over 135 species of sharks live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store chain plans to expand into the UK cosmetics market
The Sainsbury's chain throws a glove at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing style-related beauty departments to their supermarkets, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market – which is worth ?2.8 billion and is constantly growing despite the declines in the fashion and household goods industry – 11 stores belonging to the chain will feature larger shelving with cosmetic products. If the initiative is successful next year, the activities will be extended to further points.
The turn towards the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways of zoning the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the chain will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 items. The range will feature goods from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees articles will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its Boutique makeup product range. From now on, most articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume retailer will create test outlets at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local shops makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the chain tries to fight discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has been introducing a number of Habitat outlets since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased grocery sales and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
In the early 21st century, Sainsbury's set up a joint-venture with Boots to try, but the cooperation was terminated following a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celestio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for an amount of         ?125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores of the chain.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of the beauty departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet any needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way they shop so far."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a $11 million contract
Peter Jones, star of the television show Dragons' Den, was "angry" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to pull out of an 11 million-pound lifestyle brand to focus on a newly established partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby does not have time for their brand offering accessories and household items under the name Truly.
The activity has often been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the thriving lifestyle brand and focus on a newly established partnership with Marks & Spencer and ITV, made by Holly Willoughby, enraged Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "angry" when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds he would not have time to devote to their brand offering accessories and household items to Truly.
The company had previously been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was also expected to double Holly Willoughby's estimated wealth of 11 million pounds.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, "Truly was Holly Willoughby's top priority.
She tied her future to her and wanted to deal with her for several decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
In the Warehouse in Marlow, there are goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the resignation of This Morning programme presenter and one of the UK's most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and household items – as well as leading to further delays in entering the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin maintained a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby co-founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as CEO.
Couples were on leave together, and Jones held a 40% stake in the television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president joked about the media criticism caused by the remark made, which some considered "unfriendly to the statesman", as well as a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a television presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The President pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in a second meeting, the first meeting taking place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are stalling.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "analogous response" from the United States to North Korea's early efforts to disarm.
He noted that instead, the United States maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had positive effects: they led to the end of missile trials, helped free the hostages, and returned the remaining American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It's easy to act presidential, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to a crowded stadium, we'd have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered directly in front of us.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok Island earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of Lombok residents, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid efforts.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain that international personnel will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
Faced with the upheavals constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu – despite the issue of a warning – likely affected the death toll.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is headed for Palu City with help from earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's infrastructure the focal point of his campaign and allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's election, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo came under pressure due to religious tensions persisting in the country. Members of the majority Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands of residents lost their homes as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge scores a goal for a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1-0 to the detriment of his team.
Before taking a shot in the direction of the away goal, he shifted the ball to his left leg.
The ball soared high above the penalty field towards the upper right corner of the net.
She then fell into the goal, flying over Kepa Arrizabalaga throwing at her.
"I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri were always trying to get it as far ahead as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot possible," Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I noticed Kante approaching, took the ball and fired a shot without further ado."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kova-icia and then ran towards mid-Liverpool.
Kova?ić quickly accepted a pass in the middle of the field.
He then performed a beautiful forward play in the penalty field back to Hazard.
Gambling overtook the defenders and with his left foot fired a long shot that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli club in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832 people
Indonesia's disaster agency said Sunday that the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has risen to 832.
During the conference, a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that as a result of Friday's earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under the rubble.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
After a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside County, a murder investigation was launched.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are requesting contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious incident.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner for Investigative Affairs, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all people who were at that time near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers, whose recorders could have captured material useful during the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people claiming to know a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into a residential building, but was told by police that entry to and exiting the facility was currently prohibited.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just been informed that they will not be able to return to their apartments anytime soon.
One of the officers was heard explaining to the man that the area is now considered a crime scene.
A weeping woman appeared at the scene.
She kept saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars in the fenced-off area, and another police vehicle was parked right next door.
Inside the demarcated zone, there are officers guarding the apartment building.
Persons with information are asked to contact us via Twitter ( ?MerPolCC) or by telephone at 101, or to report anonymously via Crimestoppers organization at 0800 555 111, giving the event number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell monument in front of British parliament last victim in dispute over "writing history anew"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The iconoclastic activities during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft depicted Cromwell on the monument is indicative of the opinion that this politician enjoyed in the 19th century, and that he is still a figure to be commemorated for many people.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: "For many people, Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than he is today – as a defender of parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of how accurate this statement is is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and commemorated."
In China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, there was a fatal attack by a pig on a farmer at a market in the southwest of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a severed artery near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui, Kuejczou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to carry out vaccinations in a pig factory, on 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, the man arrived at the market with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found the man's body and noticed an open door to a nearby pigsty.
He said there was a large piglet in the pigsty with blood on its face.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a nearly 250-pound pig that fatally battered the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised," said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The CCTV footage shows Yuan arriving at the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that while police were gathering evidence, the pig was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Swine attacks on humans have been reported before, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier in Wales, a 300-pound pig had nailed a farmer to a tractor, and the man's wife had managed to pull the animal away.
After eating an Oregon farmer by pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals were not usually aggressive, however, the taste of blood could trigger violent behavior in them.
"They just want to have fun.
They're like very inquisitive kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa blows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time it was given Category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
According to forecasts, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than head eastward to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving masses of moist air northward to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of Mexico's territory.
In the following days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the South West of the US.
In some places, precipitation between 2.5 and 10 cm high will lead to sudden flooding, pollution movements and possible landslides in desert areas.
Moist tropical air will cause precipitation from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in some places, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some areas of the U.S. Southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Due to the diffuse nature of tropical precipitation, sudden flooding and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
Faced with the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly discouraged to move on foot in the desert area.
Heavy downpours can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusty winds and dust displacement.
Incoming than will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause slight displacement of contaminants and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall so far in the region.
Passing tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and last until Wednesday.
Temperature fluctuations may occur in the Arctic region throughout the United States in October, but the intertropical zone will be rather warm.
This can lead to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central United States.
Between Kansas City (State of Missouri) and Omaha (State of Nebraska) and between St. Louis (State of Missouri) and Des Moines (State of Iowa), these differences are nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, warm early October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, temperatures can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's auditions
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the stirring hearing of Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political stalemate on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly broadcast programs to inform of a sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was groping her in a state of intoxication and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh, on the other hand, said that he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that Friday's number of viewers was even greater than Nielsen's 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
However, figures were not yet available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen typically has difficulty measuring viewership among people in the workplace.
The number given is similar to the ratings of American football cup competitions or the awards of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen reports, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day audition.
In second place was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday's events.
In the morning, he was captured by the cameras of CNN and CBS after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. In the video, he screams at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on his way to the hearing of the judiciary committee.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN.
"I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have strength in the face of the infirmity of so many women," he heard from a woman demonstrating.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued a statement and that he would speak during the committee's hearing.
Later on, television stations continued to broadcast events in anticipation of a vote to hand over Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the accusations in the coming week, which a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their own advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham (UK), September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside one featuring Theresa May on the title page, former foreign minister in her government Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the aftermath of Brexit, according to which Britain and the EU could collect duties on their behalf, calling it "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of LSU fighter's murder
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player appearing in the colors of Louisiana State University (LSU).
Police headquarters in Baton Rouge reported that twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was detained and placed in custody on suspicion of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a CBS-affiliated WAFB station, police officers found the aforementioned glasses on the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
Police reported after hearing Simpson that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer of the detainee, the amount of bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department expressed its thanks to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police, and nearby residents for helping with the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked local law enforcement for "working hard and pursuing justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
A 198 cm tall man grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "scattered" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of those things we're constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano dates back to Mexico City.
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the nation's disaster prevention center advised Mexicans not to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center has seen numerous rumbles and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in neighborhoods of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has remained active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between demonstrators supporting Catalonia's independence and police prevention units. On that day, thousands took part in self-hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the exhilarating referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers, dark clouds of dust shrouded streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also took place in the later part of the day, and in order to stop the fighting, police forces used batons.
For several hours, groups supporting independence chanted "We don't forget, we don't forgive". Opponents of secession shouted "Long live Spain".
As reported by the local press, fourteen people received medical attention in connection with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, the tension has not waned; although it has been declared illegal by the authorities in Madrid, it is still a cause for celebration for those wishing to secede from Catalonia.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence; however, turnout was low due to a wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, however, a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had some of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents were crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck at the point of no choice," he said.
Despite a significant but minor victory in the local elections last December, the parties supporting Catalonia's secession have difficulty continuing. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in custody due to the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic recording a police-supporting protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his desire to run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Candidate in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving a car into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit by a car several times in a house in the city of Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 pm British Time (BST).
Investigative Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point, a crossbow shot could also be fired towards the car.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston wins over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Livingston, who has been playing in the extra-league since that season, has left the Rangers stunned, inflicting only a second defeat on Steven Gerrard in his 18 games as the club's coach from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be the winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains this season without a victory away in the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the Hearts leader, to whom they lose eight points.
Earlier, as early as Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston extends the series of victories in his division to six games. Coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed several opportunities against indisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's playing had caused Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and fired a shot at the goallight, but failed to score a goal, and then Alan Lithgow failed to hit after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during fixed portions of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal came to pass.
After the Rangers surrendered the free throw, Livingston's team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the Menga situation, which scored a goal from the centre of the penalty field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, however, they could not push through the hosts' defenses and did not cause much trouble to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was overturned by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal light from another permanent piece awarded to Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in Livingston's penalty field, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton's replacement and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' pretensions were dismissed.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" Performance – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played wonderfully, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and line-up have hardly changed since their return to the extra-class, but Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This match had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in directing a well-organized defense, but Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they have great moments under Gerrard's leadership, they have not maintained their standards in this match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once did they manage to break through the hosts' defenses. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, a visit aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union led to disputes.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
In this city lives the largest number of Turks outside their homeland.
According to police, a crowd of 25,000 gathered outside the temple for security reasons, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt a politician in the country.
Opposite protests reflect the divisions aroused by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and recognized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies as a result of car collision
The cyclist was killed after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the congested intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the southeastern district of the city, around 10:15 British Time (BST).
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about a mile and a half away from the scene of Saturday's accident).
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers were working to identify the deceased man and inform family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus detours were arranged, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Correctional Facility: Six officers injured in riots
As reported by the authorities of the facility, six officers were injured as a result of riots in the men's prison with an increased level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire began on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British Time (BST) and are still ongoing.
A specialist unit called Tornado was called for riots involving eight prisoners in one of the plant's wings.
Officers on the scene sustained minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: "Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six officers sustained minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities, and we are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison."
There are more than 500 inmates in the HMP Long Lartin Correctional Facility, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, riot squads were called to the facility due to a dangerous riot, in which workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden flooding from Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on drought areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. This is likely to happen early next week. The remnants of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the South West, posing a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts, on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix, and on Monday afternoon, rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that "since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona state border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm in height. In some areas, the Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm in height.
In the rest of the desert areas of the South West – including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rainfall accompanying Hurricane Rosa can bring relief as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where there is a state of drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona's land area faces severe droughts that fall into the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will reach the California Peninsula in Mexico first.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane strength, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a high flood risk.
Weather.com reported that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora state, precipitation is predicted to be between 7 and 15 cm high, although it can reach 25 cm".
Then, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in a northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will travel to the southern part of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora State, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
According to forecasts, rains will cause life-threatening sudden flooding and pollution movements in the desert and mud avalanches in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested in attempted murder case
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in the village of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 British Time (BST).
The victim was transported to the hospital and her condition remains "stable".
As reported by Avon and Somerset police, one seventeen-year-old, two eighteen-year-olds and a twenty-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night.
Officers ask to be contacted by anyone with footage of the incident.
Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh "has known the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote cast on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous conduct," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "has known the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the congress, strongly and emotionally contradicting Christina Blasey Ford's accusations. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man sexually assaulted her.
Ford also testified during a hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans could see Kavanaugh's brilliance, class, and courage."
"The vote cast on Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of support for one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, a law expert with great merit for the community," he said in front of a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly address Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-presidential election.
"We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
I am not running in this election, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump says Democrats have a policy of "resisting and obstructing."
As one of the assistants to an important Republican politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
At least 384 people were killed – many of whom were abducted by high waves crashing into beaches – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
On Friday in Palu hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival taking place in the city. At dusk, waves reaching up to 6 meters in height hit the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat came yesterday, those on the beach did not immediately escape and fell victim to a tsunami," Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency BNPD, said at a conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami was attacking everything in its path, kidnapping cars, logs and houses," Nugroho reported. He then added that before reaching the shoreline, the element was moving at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the disaster agency show many damaged houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by aftershocks.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to a statement from the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said the city's geographical location, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have compounded the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people are presumed missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communication "has been completely paralysed", so there are no reports from Donggala Province.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement. It was also added that the organization's staff and volunteers are going to the affected sites.
"We can already talk about the tragedy, although the situation may deteriorate significantly," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about an upcoming tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashed into the shore, abducting buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began sending transport aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, however, people evacuated still badly need food and other basic necessities.
The airport located in the city opened exclusively for humanitarian aid transports. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
Over 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseba T. Sinai, the national director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from Donggala province to the city of Palu and found shelter in tents made of tarp placed in the courtyard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to help, there have been criticisms that employees of foreign humanitarian organizations with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, accepting funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not been done so far.
"We are officially still facing a regional disaster," a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
"Once the government recognizes that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that hasn't happened yet."
Two days after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of the devastation.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled from the canals.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders participating in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandono recounted how within hours of the paraglider community's news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse, he was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to athletes attending the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
"It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing cash at an ATM at Newport on the Levee mall
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was replenishing cash at an ATM at Newport on the Levee mall.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man "runs from behind to a Brink employee" and steals a bag of cash for an ATM machine.
According to the communique, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of thieves are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: "A person formerly known as Kanye West."
Forty-one-year-old musician has already used the pen name Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change came before a visit to Saturday Night Live, and the artist is expected to present his new album Yandhi during the show.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who according to the creators resigned from participation "for emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has religious significance.
"It seems to me that «ye» is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In Scripture, it means «you»," West said earlier in the year, discussing the title of an album with a radio presenter called Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, also wrote down his nickname in various ways, with a connector, no connector, and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledges not to use military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday at Three Cultures Square, López Obrador promised to "never use the military to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The incident occurred at a time when left-wing student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the young people of Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China's activity in this area increases, the United States should double its AI research spending.
The remark is related to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The AI research budget needs to be doubled to begin with: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, CNBC also said that doubling funds could double the chances of another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of the most significant artificial intelligence companies in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that beat the best American player in the Othello game at the time. He then held a leadership position at Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of earlier technology initiatives of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the struggle, because according to him it would help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government subsidies.
"It's not China that takes away the best academics from us, it's corporations," Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop AI.
"I believe that people with artificial intelligence who have obtained a PhD degree should automatically be awarded a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create next-generation artificial intelligence.
As Lee pointed out, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to that of the American National Science Foundation and other government funding organizations for American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage partners from the world of industry and science, while the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced that it has allocated US$2 billion to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a national committee on artificial intelligence security has not moved forward in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would put a stop to a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historic land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory, and consequently vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President Orge Ivanov said he would not vote. The campaign to encourage the boycott raised doubts as to whether the turnout would reach the minimum level of 50% required to declare the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organizations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted for the future of my country so that the young people of Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. Membership in the EU will give us all greater security," said 79-year-old Oliwara Georgijewska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state electoral commission reported that no unusual events had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. At that time, 66% of eligible people cast their votes.
"I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in the city of Strumica in Macedonia, the country's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country's name to open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents laid out by those boycotting the referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with our head up, not the back door," Kawardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will advocate a name change in the referendum because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after the vote.
He stated that the "yes" vote was "a confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in a referendum, less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV, Telma TV in a Sunday referendum plans to vote 57% of respondents.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since taking power last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero defeats Brighton's entire defence and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home Brighton's defences in a Saturday meeting ending with a score of 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The goal scored by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with a midfield pass to an Argentine striker.
The footballer has surpassed three defenders of Brighton.
Aguero was then among the four Brighton players.
He first played one of them and then outpaced the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's penalty field.
He then played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty field, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
"Aguero faces a foot injury," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the ability to play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that time."
However, it was Sterling who provided the blues with the first lead in the Premier League duel.
The gate in question fell in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to a far post.
Manchester City's assailant pointed the ball to the net just before it fell out on the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of the Rockies winning
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to perform in the first line-up.
However, competitively-loving Scherzer hopes to perform in a Sunday meeting against the Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies retain the chance to perform in the play-off phase. Currently, the team has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on a wild card at least if they win Friday's meeting against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to win their first division title.
"Despite the fact that we're playing 'nothing', at least we'll get on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the opponent's performance will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to attend this meeting?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday's meeting, but the team is leaning towards putting Scherzer on the first lineup.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth appearance in the first line-up. The player took part in Thursday's throw training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher of the Washington team scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated batters and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Trump made no direct reference to his appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Justice, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-presidential election.
"In November, we put all our achievements on the line.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running, I remain very active. I am constantly defending our wonderful candidates," he said.
He then continued: "We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, they're mean and vicious.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt to gain power and control, taking power and control is their goal, but we won't give it back to them."
As he said, the Democrats are pursuing a mission to "set up resistance and obstruct activity."
"It has been very well seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, malicious, unpleasant, and untruthful."
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, recalling U.S. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which was met with a loud buzz from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak of the document?
«Uh, I'm listening?
No... I mean... no". Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of those expressing their own opinions
When Momentum activists in my party voted to reprimand me, I wasn't surprised.
In the end, I am a member of a group of Labour MPs who have been told recently that they are not welcome, all because of expressing their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for reprimand was due to a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
The announcement on Friday of a meeting of Labour MPs from the Nottingham East district read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive."
In my eight years as a Labour MP, most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now held differently, and it has long been forgotten the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy, if it has ever been remembered.
It is increasingly clear that there is no tolerance for dissenting views in the Labour Party; each opinion is judged to be in line with the party leadership.
It all started not long after Jeremy Corbyn took office, and colleagues who seemed to me to have similar views began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not have agreed with before, such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public appearance – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for the nomination to be received, for the condemnation of centrism or for leaving the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the remarks directed at me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment on a daily basis, but do not shy away from further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current policy is moving to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With each motion for a "vot of no confidence" and each change in the party's rules of choice, the party's worldview is narrowed.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly advised not to lean out and to keep quiet on certain issues.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of Margaret Thatcher's government, which led to the dissolution of my school class, I have been trying to ensure a better quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and minister.
I never covered my beliefs, not even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East district knew my position and knew about the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I wish to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an upcoming Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of rescinding nominations or ad hoc political goals will deter me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 – Undefeated Ayr again tops
Two late touchdowns may have skewed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win in this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga match.
The team came first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
By the end, it was a standout defense and a better use of opportunity that led the home team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been happy with his charges.
"The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we're still undefeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team stated, "You have to pay respect to the Ayr players. They have taken better advantage of the opportunities that have arisen from us."
Ayr came out in the lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson was hit and Frazier Clima was raised. However, a yellow card for the Scotsman Rory Hughes, who came to the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an untapped chance of being raised.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking from the penalty kick just before the first half ended. He first scored a touchdown and later took advantage of the chance to raise, scoring 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well, Patrick Anderson's touchdown increased by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer hold on the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott. The player was lifted from the pitch on a stretcher. After resuming, Ayr increased the lead after putting on Stafford McDowall and raising Clima.
Subsequently, acting team captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose re-used his numbers: a touchdown with an untapped attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clima without a ball. MacPherson scored a touchdown on the back of the impending defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise, then again managed to raise the score just after the game resumed, as Kyle Rowe caught a penalty shot and allowed wingman Gregor Henry to score a fifth touchdown for the hosts.
TV series star Still Game kicks off his career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, star of the television series Still Game, seems to be starting a business in the food industry, recently discovered to be the director of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor takes on the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular sitcom, performing and co-creating the series together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series' history, all indications being that Ford Kiernan is already planning a future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a Scottish Sun whistleblower suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the "growing food industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the vicinity of the naval base in La Paz.
There are blue flags flying from public buildings.
In the naval ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to recover it."
In Bolivia's non-accessible sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources from the 19th century is still alive, as if dreaming of sailing again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in decades. Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be issued on October 1 after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's actions are gaining momentum. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and are counting on a favorable verdict," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the meeting of the International Court of Justice together, hoping that an organization based in The Hague will recognize Bolivia's claim and after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to enter into negotiations to grant the state independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president, who will face a controversial re-election battle next year, also puts his hope in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts say that the chances of a favorable ruling for Bolivia are slim and that even a favorable decision would not make much difference.
The United Nations, based in The Hague, has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile, and has also stipulated that it will not affect the arrangements for possible talks.
As the Chilean International Law Specialist, Paz Zorate, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice would be made six months after the final arguments were put forward. Such a short time shows that the case "was not complicated".
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years may have distanced the country from its goal.
"The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zurate.
Morales' relentless rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
For both of these countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the topic of access to the sea as part of political play.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an excellent opportunity to see that we need to deal with the past."
North Korean officials say nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore Summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "dream" is that the lack of lifting sanctions and the US's opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking specific disarmament steps first.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about dismantling its arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means to guarantee security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of great headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a number of crazy, oversized headgear included in their 2019 summer collection that dazzled with style during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats towered on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's distinctive work was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide feathered roundabout flooding the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple; however, they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of peculiar masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouth sewn up and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style more than haute couture.
One creation resembled snorkeling equipment and glasses, and another looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with big fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
Undersized hats follow the "La Bomba", a straw hat with a 61 cm wide roundabout that everyone has been wearing – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which spilled through social media, presented another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as large as the model wearing it dressed in a bathing suit.
The lit orange reef bag, finished with reef fringes and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to come out in stores next summer – because the designer has managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to take advantage of the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their academic achievements – in 2018 they were able to boast further excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland aim to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path, and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the ability to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages are ranked first in league rankings, with the highest pass rates occurring in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored higher A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as electives, is conducted in the same scope as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) within curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers' lack of language skills was responsible for 17 percent of job vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people to start their careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of your career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a YouGov poll in 2013, which involved more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage of speakers, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign language teaching is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of the child, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, which will be taught by teaching staff specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed – regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth ample choice, diversity and level.
That's just the way it should be.
John Edward, Chairman, Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut for the Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut in the Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that LeBron James would play in a Sunday preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, but less than 48," stated Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers team reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to participate in pre-season games to get ready," he said.
Trump election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump-scheduled election rallies to be held next week, along with stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his suspension of his election to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support in the upcoming midterm elections of governments, as Republicans may be threatened with losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump's West Virginia election rally be held tonight, and where will it be viewed on the Internet?
Trump's election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held today at 7 p.m., i.e. Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia election rally will be live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearings held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated Senate vote to suspend election for a maximum of one week while the FBI investigates.
The main goal of this series of election rallies, however, is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump's campaign with five rallies next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is such an important point in the president's schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to give his name.
Today's election rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburg," West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president arrives to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Spirit, Keeping Hope for Victory in Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon may have been what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and most of all, at competitions like these.
So what does their momentum look like at this point?
"They led by six points, and now they only lead by four, so I think we have a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are twelve more to be won.
Americans, Spieth says, however, feel the wind in their sails and have worthy role models, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them could boast of scoring three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Throat screams that were a sign of excitement became louder during the course of his round, sinking the key putt and winning the match as he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, was met with a similar cry – one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
"Just focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of any of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely pair of the European team won four out of four and were right.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't pass the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they were playing different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double on the front nine kicked the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a change in strategy can occur in an instant.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team has a competitive edge to fight in, which some, especially in the U.S., have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with a score of 10-6 Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he took the charge, winning two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing his previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the underprivileged American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make up for the losses.
To retain the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points out of the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while with Molinari (the team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball format in magnificent style, they defeated pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 result.
Woods, who struggled through two Saturday games, occasionally showed flashes of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats to date, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the world rankings of positions 1 and 3 respectively.
The European team, however, did not go all the way on this pleasant, cool day in a field southwest of Paris.
Three-time primary winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with a score of 2&1 over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team made a four-point loss by starting singles, although only a tie would be enough for the team to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday's counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday during a speech at the UN that the failure to lift sanctions only exacerbates North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way that the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and a commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated known North Korean complaints about Washington's reluctance to take a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement appeared to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent President of the United States and the leader of North Korea, held on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work towards the "denuclarization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (between 1950 and 1953), but the United States delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclarization in the first place' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the signing of an 'end-of-war declaration'," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dreams of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the failure to lift sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed earlier this week by the U.S. leader at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: "If the party to the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, then there was no such deadlock in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
Mim this, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to last year, when he said during the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles in U.S. territory is inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim Jong Un a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a UN forum, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said much work needed to be put in, and said that until North Korea was stripped of its nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday at the U.N. Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be continuous until we find full, final and verified denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said later that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea denounced him for "setting gangster demands" within hours.
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He stated that Kim Jong Un told him that the "adequate measures" he cared about were security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on proper long rest
A new course at Harvard University, held this year, provided all students with more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of learning by "caffeinated all-night students."
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a course by giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
"After the speech, one girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this only now that I'm in my senior year of college?'
She stated that no one had ever told her the meaning of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students are explained how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said that the course was decided to introduce after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a range of interactive assignments.
One section includes an image of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not cause an immediate change in student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride from "all-night learning" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
Providing enough good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry," he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step according to him is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a reminder alert when they need to go to bed and when they need to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic device screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered while fighting away in Livingston when Dolly Meng with his shot led to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, scoring 1-0.
The team from Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory since the February 4-1 triumph over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing his team to have a difference of eight points against Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Ranger squad showing no commitment didn't look like it was going to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Ranger team may be in further trouble due to the need to cover the head wound of line referee Calum Spence after he was hit with an object thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, allowing him to overtake Ayr and advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same eleven Livingston, who took the Hearts team's point last week, being delighted at the way his well-trained team tormented their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but it was Livingston's team that did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitching of the ball allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free kick to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow playing in the defensive position could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he deserved a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers managed to fire only two accurate shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston's 34-minute opening goal may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort put into getting it.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep solid piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who remained calm, serving it to Menga for a simple action finish.
Gerrard was not idle in the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent – this switch almost immediately affected the winger who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, coming from his position.
Livingston's team continued to draw guests into the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long passes one after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the lead in the final minutes, but McGregor pawned himself well in front of Jacobs, after which Lithgow dismissed the game from the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a penalty kick as he tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our edition of Almanac's Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity that eventually led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, which starred these seemingly unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now you hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells as part of treatment.
This method involves separating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine teaching the immune system to recognize hostile cells has been reported to have ovarian cancer atrophy for more than 18 months.
The method involves separating immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that this vaccine is very promising."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" their localization of cancer cells worked to treat some type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA cap on her head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was "exploded" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing that night his third song titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap that read "Make America Great", he made a speech against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"Whenever I talk to white people, I hear, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a skit with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems with his cap behind the scenes.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're all over me!
And then they say I have no choice," he said, "Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You say I have no choice?", adding, "I'm going to put on a 'supermen pellet' so you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Let's accept."
His words caused the audience to "wake" twice, and members of the SNL crew looked embarrassed, Variety reports. A person in the studio during these events: "There was a grave silence in the studio".
West was invited to the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of the song I Love it in the guise of a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR BEING MAFIA".
Speaking on Twitter, talk show host Karen Hunter said West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I will NOT reward a person (by purchasing her music or clothes or supporting her 'art') who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we free," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name – he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Allegation of attempted murder in a stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police reported.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington addresses the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval-era HBO television series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen causes young boys to often think they have to play tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "quite confident" about the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point -- where did we make a mistake about masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men while they were growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly the responsibility of television due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued, "What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, what makes young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time – what can be done to change that?
It is clear that everything is not okay with young men."
In an interview, he also stated that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended the following year, saying that he had "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"On set, I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the object of the character's love interests played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as reported by the country's health workers.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, meaning a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly in parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to a year ago, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members leaked the Republican Party's senators' data - these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal details of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's respective legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party assured that these accusations were made by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wing".
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Public information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
It was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators challenged Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative parties such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information regarding a Waters team member, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false, and it's a 100 percent lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my team – whose identity, personal data and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false, and it is a 100 percent lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"Such a way of denying is wrong," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He must not question the motives of the person making the charges.
For that, he must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the midterm election to replace Waters, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a big deal, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her cabinet had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent accusations."
"The perpetrators will be exposed and held legally accountable for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Johnny English: Knockout Movie Review – A Spy Parody with Weakened Rowan Atkinson
Searching for references to Brexit in every new film with a British thread has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of action and comedy films "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will a self-speak satire about how hopeless we are become the country's new export commodity?
In any case, the ever-surprised, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English was once again licensed to babble – his name more than anything else signals that he is an elaborate, comical product intended for non-English audiences.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre taste for smoothie glamour, has a touch of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Beans, and a cap of that guy adding one note to the theme tune of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man – Atkinson once played in the already forgotten television commercials Barclaycard, in which he left chaos behind.
There is one or two notable moments in Johnny English's latest film series.
I loved the scene where Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by the rotor blades.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson's gift to physically play comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since now also "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedic elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults – in my opinion Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as imaginative and consistent as the gags in Atkinson's silent films about Jasi Beans.
The ever-present assumption is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker penetrates the UK's super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field, much to the horror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a minor role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's spell of bitterness, which is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power to play Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop her wings.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies she will have to reinstate one of the retired agents.
And that means the inept Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some classy school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent – some pretty good gags when giving English spying lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for briefing, reconnecting with his former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the submarine commander, a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, Batman and Robin partridge in Her Majesty's secret service return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously overpowered by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems – the ominous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; bring chaos by sneaking aboard a luxury yacht Volta; and English wreaks havoc when using a virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
In the latter sequence, all restrictions disappear, however, despite the nice and boisterous performance, the entire film closely resembles children's television.
Typical average.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan that provides for a four-day work week for the British, for which they will receive a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving pay for five days.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings earned by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend by getting the same amount of pay.
Sources state that the idea will "enter" into the party's economic agenda and plans to go out to meet the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from a change in the economy.
A senior Labour member told The Sunday Times, "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year."
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is something that fits in with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance in favor of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea, with the Green Party committed to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not being considered by the party."
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "speculators" in utilities.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share, as the Labour government could make "deductions" based on the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up integrative ownership funds to give 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in a 60-minutes program to the question of whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their attitude
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the investigative bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"Going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when that charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, decisive and unambiguous."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to have been forged in stone.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it requires a strong charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he gives could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty in any way?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival will be held, an annual music event that boasts an extremely impressive line-up of performing stars and an equally impressive mission – the eradication of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the event's most important goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), concert participants had to complete a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant activities to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty eradication.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in the perspective of the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or is it another case of so-called "clictimism" when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting an entry on Tweeter?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million "actions" by people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different goals.
He also claims that these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and laws worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured measures have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help address malnutrition in the country, after members of Global Citizen sent over 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition go down in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
To one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which read "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?",
The Global citizen responded as follows: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the once great civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are among the stars performing at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, the Washington Examiner, revealed.
Zinke maintained that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy trade, as they do in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, through its navy, has the opportunity to make sure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in reality they are the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "puck who knows one trick" with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration is continuing its mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe – which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is expected to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with United States Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm election.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and that includes a woman in the top office," she said.
"After November 6, I will consider my candidacy for the presidency."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that she was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren bluntly voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option "probably" said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick – 38 percent supported his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed it.
Other famous names from the Democratic camp taken into consideration for a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Track Palin during Donald Trump's election rally
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he returns, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told the audience at Donald Trump's election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest a "taboo subject," after which she said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back, wondering if there will be any respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all the other members of the military have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, soliciting false statements in a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun in an intoxicated state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a list of amicus curia in Washington, D.C. on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the Board of Immigration Appeals' 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the letter said.
Prosecutors further argued in a letter that policies denying immigrants entry were hurting the U.S. economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and "represent a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Azyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such and not other political beliefs," Sessions said in his June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious ones, that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu when death toll doubled in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother, comforting her fevered son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
There is a lack of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through water-soaked things, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture to his spine and arm, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save myself.
I think I was pushed into the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "harassing" propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid addendum to the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. Congressional election on November 6, China denies this allegation.
Trump's allegation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters that this was a new stage in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to increased tariffs on reciprocal imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were to affect exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had done harm to U.S. workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China "now with doubled force begins harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from a respected American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
But there will be no dissenting voices in the Beijing street kiosk and no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic direction, given that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's best-known newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women with voting rights before midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nominee in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that these members will meet during the upcoming midterm elections with a violent response, particularly from women.
The emotions accompanying this event are extremely large, and the majority of Republicans already officially want to vote.
"This cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)'s last-minute investigation was enough to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and they won't forget it until November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, told a Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November is coming", demonstrating in the Senate lobby due to Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee's decision not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale," said one news website, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say he was already tall, and that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault directed at a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans had decided to approve the candidacy, it might have been met with a violent reaction.
"The Republican party has to deal with a big mess," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also about the way the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, said on one of the news channels, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more support from the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied while testifying, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake put pressure on him, the FBI launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during an admission while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on an open source platform, Solid, owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"A historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own "online store with personal data" or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify available in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal information is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid's platform accessible to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project, and a volunteer developer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to make a total change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
"They don't ask for permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been a major contributor to the net neutrality debate in recent months.
With Inrupt Berners-Lee, he will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to be thinking about the next era in network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: decorated clergyman with the Victoria Cross during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was decorated on 29 September 1918 for his assault on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never finding out that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly on the centenary of his grandfather's decoration was "uniquely symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns."
He then hurried to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led her forward, then single-handedly launched an attack on the field division post, rendering three of them incapacitated.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never live up to, but something humble at the same time."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the end of a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to watch the emotion-packed Bellator 206 gala and ultimately not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the switch to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they didn't sleep until the early hours of the morning specifically to see the fight.
One Twitter fan described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "some sick joke".
"According to the government's regulation, content of this type is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., making it necessary to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp's Pig, yes".
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would fine-tune the schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about a repeat of the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it is Sunday six in the morning, and we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show changed there, we were swamped with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't a glitch, it was a legal issue.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six, which is a standard amount. We wanted to please fans too much and unfortunately we overdid it.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on a program first hosted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, "To this day, this sense of lesser value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that he was "worth something" not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy, being able to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give others "hope" in this way.
A three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, surprised him.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first Olympics at 14 and his father's death from cancer three years later, "he said it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to have a front-row seat.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You won't be with us to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics - it was the best feeling possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud performed by Heather Small, which accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which continues to give him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no Mickelson form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to work on his form so that he doesn't leave his mark.
Mickelson, who played for the twelfth time in the biennial event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case with him on the United States team, the five-time primary winner had to spend a day cheering for the team and working to improve his game in hopes of fixing the reason for his being sent to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who never gave the simplest strokes, even at the peak of his career, does not work well on the tight field of Le Golf National, on which vicious strokes are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesc Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the start of the 12 singles) start the game with verve, Mickelson's match can prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his competitor – he could hardly have done anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, embraced me with his hand, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the games of his bands both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how things turned out, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, and Furyk said his presence has contributed a lot to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, funny, and it's good to have him in the band room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings a lot more to his person than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult gameplay.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where he and his accompanying vice-captain Sev Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest possible hair, winning 141-2-131-2.
"It is impossible to forget that we had a big advantage in the Valderram field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of the Valderram field we only won by a hair," said Bjorn, in the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave the lead 10-6 at the Le Golf National field.
Time will tell me and all the team members that it's not over.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will only be when points appear on the board.
We have a goal of winning the trophy, and that's what we need to concentrate on.
From the beginning, I said I was focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the opposite side are, the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: "I couldn't have done it better.
Tomorrow, however, is different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It's good to play with your partner when things go your way, but when you play alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
That message that needs to be conveyed to the players is to give it your all tomorrow.
The partner must also do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will expect his players to perform better on their own than when playing with their partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced large twists on the last day, being a member of the winning team at Brookline Field, after which he failed after the European team performed a "miracle at Medinah Field".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, instigated the fight of his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow, we're playing 12 important games - you'd like to start the game at a fast pace, like you did in the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the guys up in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with leading the counterattack by facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European team players in the top half of the show.
"I've decided on this group of guys in that order because I think he's going to be okay during the whole game," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
New German warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war-era warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty layouts and rising costs at an alarming rate, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing the words of a military spokesman.
The ship should have been included in the Navy in 2014, but as a result of problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among others, reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer intervals between maintenance - operating new frigates should be possible for up to two years away from home ports.
Constant delays, however, mean that these modern warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time the service begins, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported a number of key "software and hardware bugs" that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also proved that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, weighing 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with putting the new frigates into service are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the strength of the German naval fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "end of ships capable of using".
He also said that the problem grew over time due to the decommissioning of old vessels without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the navy fleet.
National Trust eavesdrops on secret bat lives
New research conducted on the Scottish Highlands estate is intended to show how bats use the landscape to get food.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future efforts to protect them.
The research, led by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland, will involve common and minor dwarfs, as well as brown long-eared bats and bats from the redhead nocturnal family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed at key locations around the property to keep track of bat activity throughout the day.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field tests using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequency of signals sent by bats and how individual species behave.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation, as well as the best ways to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that have an impact on splinters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly adhesives and some chemicals used in building materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on bogs, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says it is the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, and the work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It emphasises the importance of control for bats before undertaking maintenance work on the estates, as the inadvertent destruction of one splinter can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are under protection – it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, as well as destroy their splinters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don't even know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has published these allegations.
The Portuguese assailant of Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's reports, Der Spiegel was to pay a woman $375,000 to remain silent.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the allegations were announced, described the reports as "fake news" in a live Instagram feed to his 142 million followers.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," the five-time gold ball winner said.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I am happy and everything is fine," added the footballer with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to a football player's room where he allegedly raped a woman anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was deceived by that "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's records, he confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "was afraid of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to overturn the settlement because she still can't forget the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying a sum of 100 million euros for it.
Brexit: Britain 'would regret' car manufacturers' departure for all time
Britain would "repent at all times" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" when a Toyota UK representative said in an interview with the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, then there will be a production shutdown at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, according to car manufacturers, the supply chain risks if the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be border difficulties, which industry officials say could lead to delays and part shortages.
As a representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its factory in Derbyshire, which would put production on hold.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid border control".
"We need an agreement, we want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make the right use of this situation," he said in today's BBC Radio 4 programme.
"Not only Toyota's statements, but also those of other manufacturers, demonstrate that we need to be able to continue what made up a very efficient set of supply chains."
Toyota's representation was unable to determine for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the works council of the union organisation Unite, said that the union members are increasingly concerned: "I know from experience that if there is a job liquidation, they will never be reinstated again.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" due to Brett Kavanaugh's relentless fight for Supreme Court candidate, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's close associates and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been talking about wearing a wire to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was about to resign.
The date for the meeting with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, and there was a postponement of the meeting to avoid interfering with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which testimony was given by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations made against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, or it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events surrounding the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll definitely inform the press about it."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked the reason for this.
Sanders said that the small number of press conferences was not due to a reluctance to "ostent" television journalists, after which she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentative".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President conducts more "questions and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have learned the numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists are given the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, it's a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we've done it very often, and press conferences will give way to sessions like this, where you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case by acting too casually and sometimes bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to convey their gratitude from the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of handling "settled status" applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations for Britain's exit from the European Union continued. Appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate once again how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing surgery as a result of suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' charging team, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery as a result of suffering a head injury in Saturday's match against Vanderbilt Commodores, which resulted in the team's defeat from Tennessee with a score of 31-27, Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He walked up to the side line and then he slipped to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on a stretcher and carried him out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury yet," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student fired from representing the college for a year to hone his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match he had five charge, which gives him 18 charge throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
According to the new Tory plans, higher stamp duty will be charged to buyers from abroad for the purchase of property in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be used to help the homeless.
This move is designed to nullify the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The increase in stamp duty will include those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of the Treasury predicts that in this way it will gain as much as 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will today announce that foreigners buying properties in the UK will be charged a higher stamp duty, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be used to help homeless people.
This move is seen as an attempt to quell Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on more earners.
Higher stamp duty will apply to individuals and non-tax-paying businesses in the UK, with additional measures to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee – charged in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates for second homes and apartments bought for rent introduced two years ago – can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to yield as much as 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and making it difficult to buy your first home or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time outside the country, many affluent regions – and especially the capital – have transformed into "ghost towns".
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to cut taxes to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of keeping property prices high by occupying the site, but not using it, and called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits on cheap housing in order to eliminate the "housing scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and an end to eviction "for no reason".
It also wants to give local governments more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I would commit to rebuilding the British dream of making the lives of every next generation better than the previous one.
It also means repairing our shaky housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here with equal ease as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, but the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to be Scotland's selector"
Sunderland team coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's selection team at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scotsman is committed to working to heal the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss over the top team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after he introduced St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player,
but I only managed to get to the B-team," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched Scotland's Hampden games with my father, and I was always attracted to it.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed as a club coach."
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel intimidated by taking over from such prominent figures at such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At present, success will be measured for me as to whether I can bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has at its disposal, there is no doubt its place," he adds.
"It won't be easy to do this, but I'll probably feel like I've succeeded here, only if I succeed."
Ross' coaching career has only been going on for three years, before which he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and was part of the Hearts team's coaching team for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa advance again after being demoted to the third league, and in the following season led the St Mirren team from the brink of decline to the championship title.
Jack Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point," Alloa's coaching position recalls.
"I really believed that leading a team was much better for me than just playing.
It's going to sound weird because as a player, I've done well, made good money, and achieved some measurable successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to get through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure of a coach's job, but I feel good in that role.
I've always wanted to train others, and I'm doing it now, and I can tell you that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life."

Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a surge of customers into British pubs, but it bounced off hiccups in restaurant chains.
Studies have shown that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA consulting firm that produced the data, says: "The continued heat and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup caused the July results to be similar to June's, when pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings dropped even more.
The 1.8% drop in sales in restaurants in June increased even further.
Beverage-offering pubs and bars have fared their best – their sales growth surpassed the decline seen in restaurants.
Food serving pubs also suffered during the heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems that people were just thirsty.
Beverage sales in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, and food fell three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM, an entertainment and tourism analysis firm, says: "These results are in line with the trend we've been seeing since late April.
The most important factors influencing the consumption of 'outside the house' remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences when considering the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for owners of food serving establishments and time will tell whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds. It sets industry-recognized standards.
One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
These reports have compounded concerns that sexual content is being posted on them.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "major" account that shows their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – set up accounts on social networks that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts – the name refers to an Instagram service where you can share photos.
These reports heightened concerns that these accounts were used to publish sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted to having a compliant "main" account, which they show to their parents, and also have private accounts.
One of the mothers, who happened to come across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, encountered a teenager who urged others to "rape her".
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to maintaining private accounts.
HMC president Mike Buchanan says, "It's worrying that so many teenagers are creating their places on the internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
At the annual general management meeting of the Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and CEO Ian Beattie described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that bringing it to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very happy to be able to give the council the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who, among his four Olympic gold medals, has victories in the 200 and 400 metres runs at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted, "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said time would tell if I would regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!"
Lactator advertising, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactation company caused a storm on the internet by publishing an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To announce the launch of the world's "world's first silent breast pump to wear under clothing", its producer, Elvie, has published a mock advertisement in the form of a music video that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn to a piece that hears the words, "Yes, I'll milk, but you can't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not just my tits."
The chorus goes, "Pump them out, pump them out, feed them to the children, pump them out, pump them out, milk your ladies."
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a lot of controversy on the internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, in order to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their babies are taken from them after a few days from birth," one user wrote.
Elvie's breast pump can be worn undetected under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their babies."
Someone else added, "This ad is completely disconnected from reality."
Others defend the clip – one of the women stated that she thought the song was "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I pulled my food away.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second bottom in it.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Someone else commented, "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who pull food away (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that the women danced with the lactators discreetly attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the notion that many nursing women feel like cows.
However, Elvie's breast pump is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes and can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their children on their hands, and even leave the house while they are pulling food away.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: "Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and provocative premiere.
By juxtaposing feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of pulling food away, while presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during Marta Jakubowski's show, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk with this product attached.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border every month is not actually changing. This is due in part to the fact that the strict rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually also undocumented immigrants who fear exposure to deportation if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adult residents of the joint farm, which would then be passed on to immigration officials.
Last week, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who volunteered as sponsors for unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously recorded.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them in a single household reside in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal background.
That is why we are constantly pursuing them," Albence said.
Shelter workers say that as part of an effort to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention – rather than after 60 days, as was done by previous standards.
Much will be put forward through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders have found that these problems are even more serious for larger centers, such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to overlook signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
During a speech before the UN General Assembly, Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem claims that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to "conduct its holy battle until the territory of Syria is cleared" from both terrorist groups and from "any foreigners staying on it illegally".
Currently, there are about 2,000 American soldiers stationed in Syria, who are mainly engaged in training Kurdish forces and Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad and advise them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting irrational fear" that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns," he said.
"They politicize matters that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad makes a political deal with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any help for reconstruction.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province with three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had a "clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action would be targeted against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-affiliated Front for the Defense of the Levant's Population, who would be "eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new commission composed of members of the ruling party and opposition to draft Syria's post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to verifying the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency ends early with removal from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far".
So far, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers during its peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" aired the highest ratings among cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
"People are flying like moths into a fire -- that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy creator and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, Club, has another theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has entertainment value".
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the admissibility of merging immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Disengagement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you're watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of secret informants while writing the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skinned jacket ("clothes overcharged with pride," as The Washington Post put it), or the implications of Trump's shocking descriptions of details revealed to Trump's aides.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario like I used to.
"What he's doing is in part like a reality show in that it delivers new content every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and daily twists of Trump's show (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to be behind.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he sat inside, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just standing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and weighing the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing all these crazy shows before and people were saying 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The influx of money from outside for the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the constituencies, as a result of which there will now be two incumbent congressmen in the race for one position, a river of cash flows into Pennsylvania's 17th constituency.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburg represents Democratic representative Conor Lamb in Congress, who obtained his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the former 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th district.
The district maps were revised after a January Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that the old districts were designated unfairly, which gave Republicans the upper hand and was unconstitutional.
The race in the new 17th district began with a campaign finance battle between the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair in the widely commented election to the 18th constituency held in March.
For more than a decade, a Republican has sat in that position, and Donald Trump has won by 20 points in that district.
Political experts gave Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until his partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to dismiss the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to cease recognition of Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said in her statement that month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were only to be imposed on El Salvador, which was estimated in 2017 to receive $140 million in aid from the United States, among other things, to combat drugs and to support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were to include restrictions on financial aid and granting visas to specific individuals, would be very severe for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and high murder rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference to address the conclusions of a similar convention last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, thus cutting off any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to perform, which is supposed to be a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the meeting.
Three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, accompanied by no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their relationship was confirmed by an external analyst from the administrative community, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn history
Another element may be the report of the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, regarding the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which there is now concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, the question of whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on American elections is also being investigated in Robert Mueller's investigation.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable in preparation for his re-sentence to the voters, and may even be tried before a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's downfall – or those in equivalent positions in Europe – is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will decide how much longer it can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The lines of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now several such turning points ahead of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that he had offered to covertly record the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for the office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the FBI's newly commissioned investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is found to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed as a Supreme Court judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most of all, will we elect, in the middle of the presidential term, those who will hold Donald Trump accountable to Congress?
If we don't pass these trials, there will be hard times for democracy.
However, I believe we will succeed because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.
Having such a legacy, how could I not look to the future optimistically?"

Rangers club player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about his match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory against the Austrians, achieved after an impressive draw with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G-group of the Europa League.
Up until a 2:2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes the result will work on the Rangers as a springboard to greater success.
"It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape," the 31-year-old said.
"We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something - and we scored.
Perhaps in the end we could still press them, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
As for Thursday, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to score three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent got a good result in his last match. I am sure, however, that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass it and we will win a positive result.
The last year has been definitely tough due to everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of retirement savings spends women's sleep from the eyelids
Even though the people who took part in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not having a conversation about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide, a life insurance company.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family for self-care unless you express your will beforehand.
With your counselor and family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from a financial advisor: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Funds for long-term care can come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses, or from your own assets – if you have one.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent court battles with this.
Designate a trusted health care attorney to supervise and ensure that the right people act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also consider hiring a proxy to handle your finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to have it prepared.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
"What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan on hand."
Man shot multiple times from windbreaker in Ilfracombe
The man was shot multiple times from a windbreaker as he was returning home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries sustained do not endanger the life of the man.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the severed communications, the rescuers failed to obtain any information from Donggal's kaupate, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the town of Palu and Donggal's kabupatena on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Celebes Central, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, celebrations of the 40th anniversary of its founding were taking place in the city.
Donggala is a kabupeten (administrative unit lower than the province) extending along the northwestern coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that it was inhabited by 299,200 people in 2017.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal Donggala kabupatene.
Another source of income for the province are nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebesu.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people were killed in a tsunami in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which makes earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that hit the west coast of Aceh Province in the north of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that broke into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed as a result.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami wave as high as 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Kabupeten Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the devastation caused by the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami wave, but the collapsing buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on suspicion of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old boy from Wasilla, Alaska, was taken into custody on charges of domestic violence, obstructing filing and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her information, last Saturday he stood trial, where in his defense speech he stated that he was "certainly innocent".
There are three Class A misdemeanors on Palina, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense for which he faces a prison day penalty and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of filing, and possession of an intoxicated weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder he contracted while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds killed in tsunami after Indonesia earthquake
At least 384 people died as a result of Friday's earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City, resulting in eight deaths. This is a rare punishment – it has not been executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bike path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental Home Depot truck that was run over by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification made in the South District of New York about the intention to demand the death penalty in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious personal injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment covering 22 positions, including eight counts of murder as part of an illegal activity – a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases – and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, organizing the attack required "solid planning and rethinking." The way in which Saipov carried it out, they described it as "monstrous, cruel and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, harm and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hern Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," states the notification of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who stayed in New York touristy.
The last time a death penalty was filed in the South District of New York was ten years ago.
Accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last performed in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse within months of the attack.
The police say he told the investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
On an indictment involving 22 charges, he responds that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender who represents Saipov, said they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and refuse life imprisonment without the possibility of early release after admitting guilt will only prolong the suffering these events have brought to all concerned individuals," he said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Tories conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage were Brexit secretary, "the United Kingdom would be out of the Union by now."
However, the addition of Tories opting to remain in the community to a separate protest against Brexit taking place in the city further highlighted the burden of the task of reconciling its deeply divided ranks facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her plan to compromise with Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite her objections, she will seek a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to "throw the plan out of Chequers".
He suggested that the proxy should be Nigel Farage, to whom responsibility for negotiations with Brussels should be delegated.
"If it were him, we would now be outside the Union," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added, "I support Brexit, but we need to kick the plan out of Chequers."
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subject to anyone now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns from the Tories party, who supported Brexit, also appeared at the demonstration, who told reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan has no popular support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists, who populate the streets and who elected us, do not support it either.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: "Prime Ministers hold their positions as they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage stated that politicians participating in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say 'we're not going to let you do this'."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
During this time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved "Torysi against Brexit" banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can organize the information systems and all the technology to handle the Canada plus plan, the smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
As reported by The Boston Globe, a Democrat representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November and will be opposed by Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren can defeat Trump.
Saturday's Holyoke event was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government -- and she also means the woman at the top."
Arrest of LSU team player Wayde Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police reported Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in a Friday shooting involving LSU team basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference held at 11:00 am Eastern Time.
On Friday, a shooting video was released asking for help to identify the man visible on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a firearm and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting at Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games, with the last season running 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the dance floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after team command enabled him to win against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would have a major impact on the race result.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to drive in the tail of the peloton, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes racer rode off to the pits in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track, risking being pushed to the defensive after the rival's double move to defend his third turn position, Hamilton stepped out into the lead.
Max Verstappen took off from the end of the stakes and placed seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap.
He then drove for a large part of the race thanks to the fact that he did not change the tyres in order to make a quick finish and take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went down to the service point on lap 44, but in the other eight laps he was no longer able to accelerate, finishing fourth in Raikkonen.
"It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team did their best to take the top two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianna Feinstein, who maintained that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address statements made by Christina Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, malicious and lying."
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the senate that we have been witnessing for days now, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, mean, vicious and lying," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't," he added, mocking the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's innuendo, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein testified before the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to be discreet, and as she requested, I did not disclose this content."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it so during Saturday's meeting: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court judge candidate whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use innuendo for their own purposes.
"They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
You can see meanness, malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take over power and control," the president said, according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match against the Dundee club, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants team.
The Dundee Stars club atone for their Friday Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 home rematch on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-gate advantage after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard again leveled the score by scoring a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's wards, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won against the Dundee team in Belfast 2-1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season – the first three games were won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaull's assist. Four minutes later, Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assist.
After an intense opening at 1:10 p.m., Sullivan brought the home team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, when he scored his second goal that evening at the end of the first period.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard re-aligned the score with a goal scored while playing in the lead in the 27:37 minute.
Towards the end of the second period, Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen secure Dundee's team's first lead in the match. Dundee's final win was sealed in the middle of the last period by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The Giants, who lost four games for their last five, will play their next game at their home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies Helping Hundreds of People on Plane Escape Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after he died, helping a plane with hundreds of people safely take off on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were declared missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks are still felt in the area, and many people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing, saving his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the rampant flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air (flight number 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision likely saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan on Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This message has torn our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, with the National Disaster Relief Agency reporting that the ability to travel to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the death toll is still increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
The six-meter-high tsunami waves destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
Drinking water is beginning to run out.
Small shops are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu and asked the army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on Lombok Island this year.
Plane crash in Micronesia – Air Niugini airlines report one person missing after plane crashes on lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, report that one person is missing, previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data for Saturday afternoon they could not count one man who was traveling on a bad plane.
They assured that they were trying to find him together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been rushed to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the crash, and its exact course is also unknown.
Airlines and the United States Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of his belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"It helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said that he and other people managed to get through the water reaching to the waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the cabin crew members panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue effort was also aided by sailors who were working nearby to modernize the waterfront. Using a blown boat, they were able to transport people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in plane crashes belonging to airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini is not among those airlines.
Analyst reconstructs events from the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended the presentation of evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to the judges how he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he obtained location data from a variety of cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on a fateful evening, thus overturning his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death Tellis removed her contact details from her phone, as well as text messages and calls.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said it was likely that the case would be referred to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed – What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today's hip-hop has moved away from the original political content and social issues.
The band members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, there has been a revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common recently in the UK.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' text
A New York nanny sues the couple for firing her from a racist job after receiving a misdirected text message in which the child's mother complains that she is "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly dismayed when it was revealed that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who had a feud on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
"NIEEE, NEXT BLACK PERSON," she wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to him, she mistakenly sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to reports in the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the gaff had been committed, she "feared" to fire Gisella Maurice, claiming that a cordial nanny who is African-American was doing her duty badly, and was also expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home by Uber.
She now demands compensation from the couple for a $350 daily exemption multiplied by the six months for which she was originally employed with the residence, although she did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refutes the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of their partnership with Mrs. Maurice was justified because, after they insulted her, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," his husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to the person you have caused distress, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail", Plasco said that his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blow something like this?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court is not over yet, the public quickly issued a judgment on a couple on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and mindset.
A new letter reveals that Paddington book publishers feared readers would feel no connection to the talking bear
The author's daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She claims that her father, who, before a little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was certain that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book seems "sweet-bitter".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family", she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, not boasting," he adds.
"However, because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something - you feel proud of him, even though it's not your fault.
I think Paddington's success was perceived in this way.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"He called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn't make it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha would die within two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs that doctors gave her to maintain heart rate slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She had died a while earlier and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit around and wait with the knowledge that it was all unfolding.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was among other people.
I had to really hold on."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers unaware of the torment she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt an all-embracing sympathy for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards from grieving women to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to lead others away from their intention to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can get help with.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and he took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, relates that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could lighten any room with it."
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was "in a really black place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created the cards to "tell people that there are people to turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit in silence - talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything about feeling down or sad or anything," he says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was already in a complete pit, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: "It rips a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for - a limited-time and limited-range investigation - perhaps we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "dispersing" into opposing camps, leading to an impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
The election to Congress is in a few weeks' time, November 6. If, as predicted, the Republicans lose it, the chances of electing a particular person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI compiles a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have a vote.
It is uncertain whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean defectors is decreasing
According to South Korean lawmakers, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1127 escapes, and in 2011 there were 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more thorough controls on the border between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul authorities, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on denuclearization negotiations that had previously come to a standstill.
This came after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, held in June in Singapore. The result of this meeting is a general agreement to try to clear the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and under these circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech he gave before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterist" and claims he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterist" and said he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think if a woman behaved this way, she would be considered a 'hysteria'," Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh was making before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his foreword, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions, almost screaming and losing his speech as he discussed family issues and high school years.
He also explicitly chastised the Democrats on the committee, outlining the "grotesque and coordinated attack on his reputation" by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's dismissal from office if he received the nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit on the Supreme Court, but also hold office in that court where he currently works," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to bring into court a hysterical, prejudiced person who will expect us to say 'but it's wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women must wield it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of pouring fury, and she can't let it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"That's pretty common, isn't it?"
She added, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager at some company, and she said that she was crying when she was angry, but she figured out a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she's talking to the person she's talking to 'You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm furious.'
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are acceptable as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office is how I once began to cry out of unspeakable rage. An elderly woman, a cool manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and walked me out to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they made you happy."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a Congressional deputy from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his lover on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, frustrated to the limit, Patricia realized that she might actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates for the election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder was behind in fundraising and promised herself that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only $250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During a speech in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions – gratitude for those who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult to raise money and address voters, not delegates, and rage at sexism – that the voice stuck in her throat.

What benefits can the economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing
The salvos starting the economic war between the U.S. and China were stunning and although the battle is still ongoing, in the long run the conflict between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (150 billion pounds), which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Each time Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it does not look like the second economy in the world is about to give way.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting the demands, but a public leaning of its head before the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the trade war with the US could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in one of the countries is in fact far more dangerous than observers have admitted so far," said Abigail Grace, a researcher on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
According to the foreign minister, Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country ruined as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid conditional on conditions or offered by countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field in the Paris suburbs.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was not doing well for most of the tournament, hit the ball from the stand straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesc Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was first held in its current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a score of 5&4 by Europe's lowest ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world rankings, lost by two holes before the last hole against Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the highest number of victories in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who had already taken part in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
It's a success for the whole team and I'm glad I could help," said the touched Garcia after the team's victory from Europe.
He hands over the baton to his compatriot, John Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with a 2&1 score.
"I feel incredible pride in winning against Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 score in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has only given way to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance of the American lineup, his captain, Jim Furyk, said, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
At some point this morning we pressed some Europeans.
We withdrew.
Hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
