Bosnians protest Croatia's plans for radioactive waste disposal
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia in protest against plans by neighbouring Croatia to store some of the waste from the region's only nuclear power plant near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad demanded Croatia to abandon its plans to build a landfill in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
The facility would store the waste from the Kriko nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us", said that the radioactive waste dump could threaten the Una River and the lives of about 250,000 residents.
We have to say no,
told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of Novi Grad municipality.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the Kriko power plant built in the 1980s also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives from both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional landfills.
Croatian public television station HRT reported on Friday that it had not yet been decided in Croatia whether to build a landfill on its own or to pay for the storage of some of the waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from each side of the country's existing ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find a different location in parts of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why does Croatia say that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?" asked Drljaca.
We can't let them humiliate us!

The first report of the commission is to be prepared and made available within one year from the date of entry into force of the Act.
U.S. Congress Agrees to Sell 32 F-35 Aircraft to Poland
The U.S. Congress for 15 days after the State Department approved the possible purchase of 32 F-35 multi-purpose fighter jets by Poland did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the purchase negotiations began.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I don't see any major obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior defense policy counsel for the Washington, D.C. conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act 1976, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days before the signing of the agreement if the value of such a transaction, in the case of arms sales to a NATO member country, exceeds $50 million.
The proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fighter jets by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes costs of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally finalized – will be the American arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for the F-35A fighter jets Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were made in May by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during a meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalized, will be overseen by Pentagon representatives under the Foreign Military Sales Program (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland's bid for the purchase was – without armament and technical assistance – about $89.2 million.
According to the PAP, U.S. military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, such a price given in the preliminary negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated."
"Prices are plummeting, currently the price of one F-35 is under $80 million, much less than the cost of a Eurofighter, which has no such advantages as an F-35," Venable pointed out.
The PAP spokespeople expressed hope that the final negotiations of the transaction on the purchase of American combat aircraft by Poland will end later this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – i.e. offset – will be discussed directly with American manufacturers of F-35 fighter jets.
What is the replacement band for the show "Payton Hobart's Choices" on Netflix?
Caregivers and parents with the disorder above pretend that their healthy child is eating sick.
Payton Hobart's "Elections" series is coming to Netflix today.
It tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first has to become president of the student government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, the creators of American Horror Story and Glee, we will see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the show, he discusses the topic of M nchhausen's replacement syndrome – a mental illness found in caregivers who act as if the healthy person they are dealing with was afflicted with a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this condition, e.g., in the form of the Munchhausen syndrome, which consists in causing symptoms of a particular disease in one's body.
A replacement for Munchhausen's syndrome is to simulate that the person in our care has certain ailments.
It is also called an invented and induced disease, and it is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms so that it looks like his or her child is sick.
What are the symptoms of the replacement Munchhausen syndrome?
Symptoms of this disease may vary, however, the NHS notes the following example behaviors:
Convincing medical staff that a healthy-looking child feels bad, however.
Exaggerating or inventing symptoms.
Falsifying the results to make a child feel sick, such as giving glucose to urine samples to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medications and other substances.
How often is the replacement syndrome of Munchhausen present?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, as many cases of the disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 indicates that there have been 89 cases of this disorder per 100,000 people in more than two years.
What should be done if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?
Contact your local special services department or call the NSPCC Child Protection Helpline by dialing 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid on school in Kaduna, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – The Kaduna State Police Station yesterday raided the Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal School, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi Local Government Area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were in highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities deny this claim.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a preacher at school, said: "They don't tell the truth because all the children were there with their parents' permission.
Before the children were admitted to school, the parents signed the form.
Parents brought food to their children every day and knew what conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of all food provided by the students by the parents before the school closed.
That's not fair, because parents can attest to whether their children are in poor conditions, police say.
He added that the former Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of child care, never had any objections.
He claimed that the children were studying the Qur'an and nothing else.
However, the Public Relations Police Department specialist, Yakubu Sabo, felt that after handing over the children to the state government, they would join their parents.
"They were kept under dehumanizing conditions in the name of subjecting or acquiring Quranic knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves that they were beaten.
That's why we're researching the school to get to know its owner," he added.
Foreign Talents Important for China's Development
Guangdong is a leader in the country in terms of attracting foreign talent largely due to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Great Bay Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao and Shenzhen's new role as a pilot demonstration area.
The Nanfang Media Group interviewed seven expats between the ages of 10 and 70 in Guangdong.
A Singaporean Yash born in 2010 at the Asian Games in Guangzhou said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and getting a PhD in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student at the Russian-Chinese university Shenzhen MSU-BIT said: "Thanks to the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
Together, we can create new concepts and new ventures.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the USA started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over a million fans on Bilibili and Weibo.
She said that in her videos she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology.
Leticia de Lassus of France, head of the JJB International Montessori AMI centers in Guangzhou agrees that "child education is like fastening a jacket.
If you incorrectly fasten the first button, the rest will never go to their right place.
Chinese-American Henry Xiao believes that at the heart of the GBA area, his company can enjoy many privileges with respect to new rules, government policies, and capital resources, and in particular talent.
Cookery producer Sean Choi of South Korea said that the cuisine of the Guangdong region is world-famous and the introduction of the Guangdong "Nanta Show" was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland, working as Technical Director for Quality at Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality lies in the correct execution of simple works.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products and persistently strive for better and better results.
Poll: Poles want Banasia to resign
Most Poles want the resignation of the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia – according to Kantar poll for TVN.
When asked "Should NIK chief Marian Banaś resign", 55% responded "yes" – including 34% marked the option of "definitely yes" and 21% "rather yes".
The answer "I don't know/hard to say" was chosen by 26 percent of the respondents, while 19 percent voted against the resignation – 8 percent marked "definitely no" and 11 percent - "rather not".
Demands for Marian Banasia's resignation came after the broadcast of the reportage "Panzer Marian and the hotel for hours" in the program "Superwizjer".
According to the material, the head of NIK was the owner of a tenement house in Kraków, in which the hotel had to operate for hours, and the gangsters running it were to rent the tenement house for their business at a lower price than the market one.
After the release of the material, Banas announced that he would take a free leave of absence on 27 September until the end of the CBA's inspection of his property statements.
Kantar's telephone survey was carried out on 25-26 September 2019 on a nationwide representative sample of 1005 people over the age of 18.
The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda", believes Tomasz Siemoniak.
Deputy Head of the Civic Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in an interview with Polsat News spoke about the scandal involving the head of the NIK.
"This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become the Minister of Culture for some entertainment matters, not the head of the NIK or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who is responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious crisis of the state," he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about the candidacy of Klaudia Jachira.
"On the PiS lists is Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who didn't just say things, he just did them.
He accused the former heads of the SKW of spying for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why does no one call for Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the lists?", he asked.
"The people who are younger than us have a different aesthetic.
I think that Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things, also feels that sometimes she exaggerates.
Let's not make this a campaign issue," he added.
Tourists after the collapse of the travel agency Neckermann Poland are planned to return to the country
According to the office, so far there was no need to bring tourists ahead of time.
"The Authority successively pays for unpaid hotel seats from the insurance guarantee," it said.
On September 25, the travel agency Neckermann Polska filed a declaration of insolvency with the Marshal's Office.
At the time of the office's declaration of insolvency, there were 3,600 tourists abroad.
A group of about 500 people returned to Poland on Wednesday, and 230 on Thursday.
The next 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece are expected to return on Friday.
Tourists will fly to Katowice and Warsaw (in total it will be five charter flights).
Some of them will return on cruise flights.
On the weekend – as planned – about 1,000 tourists staying on vacation in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy should return to the country.
According to information provided by the Marshal's Office of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, the travel agency sold about 20,000 trips for the autumn-winter season.
"These travel agency customers should contact the insurer directly – Allianz Partners", the office recalled.
He also added that "the situation of tourists who signalled problems in hotels seems to be stabilized at the moment, and the emerging incidents of embossing tourists from hotels have been mitigated together with consular services."
Last Friday, the authorities of Thomas Cook, the largest and oldest travel agency, reported that it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned a 100% stake in Neckermann Polska.
"Foolish" masked rapist of Central Coast children forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in an outfit, a masked man grabbed a school-going 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into dense scrubs in the Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after his arrest, a search warrant was executed at his home, where officers detained a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges related to the attack and to three more charges of seduction and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim followed the path, and when she looked back, she saw him unexpectedly come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and knife.
When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he grabbed her by the neck and forced her into the thicket.
The man said, "Quiet, don't shout.
Don't yell or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her arms and legs with cable ties, and later tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9.30 a.m., failing to respond to several text messages and calls from colleagues.
His clothing was dirty and carried traces of grass and trees, and he claimed to have been involved in an accident involving an attack of rage on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the embankment.
A further trial of the convicted man will take place on Tuesday.
Pope urges CEOs of tech companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executives of technology companies, diplomats, and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement is at risk of increasing social inequality if the common good is not taken into account from an ethical point of view.
Pope Francis delivered these words at a conference in the Vatican attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered at a conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in a debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
Technological achievements in the field of the art of war and the future of work, in connection with which machines will play an increasingly important role, were discussed, as well as a case study investigating the Christchurch bombing in New Zealand and decisions made by companies owning social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During a speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that thanks to machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers were spared dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on robotic devices for profit was a risk of depriving people of the dignity that comes from work.
"If technological progress were to become the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological advancement of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an undesirable backwardness to a kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the fittest.
The conference organizers expressed their hope to benefit from the expert knowledge of the participants and to identify possible future advisers of the Catholic Church in matters related to high technologies.
Martin Odegaard, a player on loan from Real Madrid, makes fans feel euphoric with his impressive assist.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assist at Mikel Oyarzabal's opening goal.
Winning 2-0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed to the top of the La Liga table and continues the streak of being undefeated on their own field this year.
However, despite failing a single defeat this season in La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure as a result of a tumultuous pre-season and public altercation with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have real talents at their disposal – for some of them the Frenchman currently has plans, for others he does not.
Vincecius J?nior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the band.
However, it was Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, who caused a great stir, scoring an incredible assist in the La Liga match.
During Real Sociedad's encounter with Alaves, Martin Odegaard made an impressive assist at Mikel Oyarzabal's opening goal and Real Sociedad eventually won 3-0 in front of his own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right, Martin Odegaard outmaneuvered the player from the opposite team, putting a net on him, and then sent an amazing pass in centimeters between the other two players and his teammate was left only to add a leg.
Willian Jose's second goal and Oyarzabal's third, this time from a penalty kick, secured a decisive victory for Imanola's charges before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid just as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet fans' expectations.
Now at the age of 20, a Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel confident on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pawar's name in the case of fraud concerning the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank
Anna Hazare stated, "Sharad Pawar's name did not appear on the list when I was handed the matter over to him."
Social activist Anna Hazare was not surprised by the fact that the name of Sharada Pawara – the chairman of the Nationalist Congress Party, the NCP – appeared in connection with the multimillion-dollar fraud in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank.
The investigative agency Executive Directorate, or ED for short, brought a case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar – former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra – and other people in connection with the fraud.
The Executive Director's information report on the case, equivalent to the FIR police report, was filed by the central agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The basis of the case is the report of the FIR of the Mumbai police, which lists the names of the former bank president, Ajit Pawar, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was nowhere to be found.
"How his name came out, who gave it, only they know these things," said Anna Hazare on Thursday, when asked about the ED case and Sharada Pawar's alleged connection to the fraud.
Anna Hazare, a critical reviewer of Sharada Pawara, expressed hope that the truth would come to light as a result of ED's in-depth investigation into the fraud.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the anti-corruption demonstration.
Sharad Pawar denies committing a criminal act and claims that he was in no way affiliated with the bank, as well as calling into question the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the October 21 election of the Maharashta Assembly.
The former Union minister assured that he would not succumb to the majesty of Delhi, unequivocally referring to the central government headed by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the matter of the Executive Directorate as politically motivated.
Busy day SG.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to export stolen items worth more than 130,000 zlotys to Ukraine.
All events were recorded yesterday (26 September) in the direction of departure from Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen was carrying an electric-powered bicycle of the Specialized brand.
SG officers, establishing the legality of the object's origin, contacted representatives of the German Police and quickly determined that a modern one-track worth about 10,000 zlotys was stolen on the territory of this country.
A few hours later, also in Korczowa, border guards controlling a semi-trailer registered in France found interference with the VIN number field.
The driver of the truck set was a citizen of Ukraine.
A semi-trailer worth about $30,000 has been stopped and will be subjected to detailed expert reports to determine the original data.
In turn, at the border crossing in Medyka, SG officers foiled an attempt to export another stolen quad of the Can-am brand (prod. 2019).
The value of the vehicle carried on a tow truck was estimated at PLN 75 thousand.
The driver of the set was a 32-year-old citizen of Ukraine.
The Border Guard confirmed that only two weeks ago the quad was lost on Polish territory and is wanted all over Europe.
A "partial" attempt to export the stolen vehicle was also thwarted in Medicine.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian travelling by bus was carrying bodywork elements from an exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were mechanically removed.
The body parts worth about 15 thousand zlotys were stopped.
South Africa: 20-year-old accused of murdering student Ukzn Sinethemba Ndlovu
As expected, a man arrested in connection with the murder of a student at KwaZulu-Natal University (UKZN), Sinethemba Ndlovu, according to the National Authorities of Prosecution (KOŚ) will apply for bail next week.
The defendant appeared at the Msinga Town Court on Thursday on suspicion of murder.
A spokesman for KOŚ KZN, Natasha Kara, told News24 that the case had been adjourned until October 2 in connection with an application for bail.
She added that Stan would oppose the release of the defendant on bail.
According to police spokesman KZN, Inspector Thembek Mbele, a 20-year-old defendant arrested on Monday.
Earlier this week, police revealed that Ndlovu suffered stab wounds under her left arm and in her abdomen.
She is believed to have worked as a hostess during Msing Diftkhan's motoring event on Saturday night.
In a statement released today, the organizers of the automotive event stated that, as initial reports suggest, after the event ended and the end of its change, several hostesses remained in place to watch the musical performances.
Along the way, one of them was unfortunately attacked by unknown men and later died in hospital," the statement said.
On Friday, the UKZN suspended classes, claiming "the circumstances of Ndlov's death require us, as a community, to stop and reflect on the fragility of life and the brutality that so often occurs in our society."
Mylan agrees to pay $30 million as part of EpiPen settlement
Mylan agreed to pay $30 million as part of a settlement related to the failure to notify investors of the Justice Department investigation into a possible demand for too much in the Medicaid program for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that Mylan NV had classified EpiPen as a "generic" drug in its Medicaid reimbursement program.
The pharmaceutical company therefore gave the government a much lower reimbursement of part of the product price than when EpiPen was classified as a "branded" drug.
In July, Mylan revealed that it had reached an agreement on the principles with the KPWiG.
In its statement on Friday, the company stated that it did not confirm or deny the KPWiG's allegations.
Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, death of a child.
These are dramas that cause a great deal of suffering and are difficult to understand.
We ask, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God wanted it that way".
Is it the Creator who sends us misery and disease?
John Paul II at the end of his life suffered greatly
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father ran out of the room in horror.
"My son has no arms or legs!" he shouted to the doctor.
The parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months Nick's mom felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is a world-renowned evangelizer and motivational speaker who converts many people.
"I am proof that God is never wrong," Nick points out.
"When suffering touches us, it is difficult to understand.
We're looking for causes.
We ask, "Why did this happen to us?".
If we believe that God rules over the whole world and directs our lives, naturally the question arises as to whether it was He who sent disease, misfortune, on us...".

The Queen's adviser, Judge Jeremy Richardson, said to the couple, "I will never be able to fully express in words how heinous things you have done.
The crimes you've committed speak for themselves.
The murder of two children.
Attempted murder of four children and all collusion to deprive them of their lives.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be sentenced to life imprisonment several times in due course."
It will be for the judge to determine whether it will be a penalty of absolute imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
The sentence will be handed down on November 12.
MP Krzysztof Brejza sues Cezary Gmyz
"In connection with the campaign of lies of Pisowska TV, I am making a lawsuit against Cezary Gmyz", the MP Krzysztof Brejza announced on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is a statement made by publicist Cezary Gmyz in the TVP's "Gone 20" programme.
One of the leading executives of SokiemzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has a lot of experience in organizing the hate department.
"People who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda perfectly – the founder of the «heiter» profile – are Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych", said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are social networking sites and profiles with memes and jokes related to politics.
According to "Networks", behind the profile with this title is the PR man Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda.
"We managed to find out that since April this year Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw city office, in the marketing office," wrote the weekly.

Boris Johnson referred to a police oversight body in connection with Jennifer Arcuri's close relationship with businesswoman
The independent police investigation office of the IOPC will investigate the possibility of an investigation being opened against the Prime Minister to determine whether he has committed criminal offences in his capacity as Mayor of London.
The Council of Greater London (GLA) stated in a statement that its supervisor had registered a "issue related to the conduct" of the Prime Minister in connection with accusations of preferential treatment of Arcuri due to their close acquaintance.
"The «issue of conduct» can be spoken of when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
That doesn't mean it's been proven somehow.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate the matter.
The issue was referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was referred to this authority overseeing police work because Johnson was then in a position equivalent to that of the police commissioner and the criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.
He had previously said that he would comply with the London City Council order and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted that the council was "focusing on the wrong problem".
The order follows a report by The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds in budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions headed by then-Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government had until the case was considered frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to Arcuri-owned Hacker House.
The government is facing troubling questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds are allocated.
Digital Minister Matt Warman said in the House of Commons that employees of his department had "typically maintained due diligence" and that the company had a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were routed to an office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently to live.
The Prime Minister's close relationship with the businesswoman "was a secret to the staff of the police".
The GLA's decision to refer the Prime Minister's case to the IOPC's independent police investigation office was met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to a source from the upper-ranking government representative, it constitutes a "politically motivated attack", and its term – on the eve of the Conservative Party conference – is "overtly political".
"The supervisor did not provide any evidence to substantiate the allegations, and neither did the prime minister get a chance to give him an answer before the press release was published late on Friday," the source said.
Neither the public nor the media will fall for such an overtly political setup.
Earlier today, The Standard journalists were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businesswoman, assisted by the tourism and promotion agency in London, was a "poliszynel secret" for employees.
London & Partners (L&P) officials were quoted as saying that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's overseas business trips as mayor despite the fact that her companies were not considered "credible" at the time.
Third accused of drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – In connection with the death of rapper Mac Miller last year as a result of a drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit fentanyl-cured oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession prior to his death in September last year as a result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol, and fentanyl, the potent opioid responsible for the "epidemic" that claimed several thousand lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed Tuesday reveal Pettit was receiving drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of being Walter's "courier" who supplied the pills to Pettit.
None of the men mentioned were directly charged with causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in their case.
Walter, who is on probation in the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months in prison for violating his parole.
Prosecutors investigating the case, which was first reported on Thursday by the TMZ celebrity website, are demanding that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the defendant's escape.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine did not come immediately.
Pettit was charged in federal court on September 4, and his defense attorney declined to comment.
The lyrics of Miller's rhymed songs are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, making him a fan of some of the biggest hip-hop stars.
Originally from Pittsburg, Miller, who was really named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained in a relationship with singer Ariana Grande for two years, ending earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she posted a touching video featuring Miller and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died from an overdose in 2016, and his body found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This article introduces a change: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games for mobile devices
The 9-year-old creates a hide-and-seek game using the free Scratch 2 programming app.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated over 30 games for mobile devices using it.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player scores every time he catches a bat coming out of the hideout.
I learned how to make games on an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," Basil told CNN.
In March, Dad enrolled him for a five-day accelerated course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was aimed at providing children such as Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara Sr., claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was four, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played it.
He played a lot of Candy Crush and Temple Run," CNN's father said.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and he was given a whirlwind for spending all his time playing games.
"One day he was playing the tablet as usual, and he was so consumed with it that I got upset," the father said.
Out of anger, I said, "you're still just playing, can't you think about making your own games so that others can play them?"
Speaking these words, I was nervous and didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning how to create his own games, prompting his parents to buy a laptop and enroll him in a course where he learned the basics of game development.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his games titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest youth population in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been praised for using codes to create robots to distribute their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from Ghanaian secondary school won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for stacking boxes.
And thanks to the growing investments of technology giants like Google and Microsoft in Africa, Basil and his peers are on track to become stars of coding.
Former North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Admits Lying About Corruption
Court documents filed on Friday indicate that former North Carolina Republican Party chairman will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption of a major political donor.
According to the wokanda, Robin Hayes is to plead guilty next Wednesday.
A document containing the factual basis, prepared as part of the defense settlement and signed by Hayes' lawyer, shows that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The plea bargain has been sealed, and it is not apparent from the factual basis to which Hayes will plead guilty.
He was initially charged with collusion, corruption, and making false statements.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the insurance company's government plan to direct campaign donations to the country's primary insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates have been charged with attempting to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment company, having been one of the state's major political donors in recent years, which has donated more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the Republican Party's goals and politicians, however, he also donated to Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday's email asking for comment.
Hayes defender Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's email with a request for comment.
According to court filings filed Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had not spoken to Causey about employees of the state's Department of Insurance.
According to the fact-based document, Hayes actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market regulator.
Prosecutors say that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million to Causey's re-election campaign in 2020.
According to the indictment, the collusion also included a request to change the department official who controlled Lindberg's company.
As a Republican, Causey reported an alleged attempt at corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence in the case.
He was not charged with anything.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's accomplice ordered Hayes to donate $250,000 to Causey's campaign during a conversation in which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
In the course of the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such an amount of money would attract attention, but, according to the prosecution, he eventually gave up.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor did not respond to an email asking for further information on the settlement.
The drivers will drive the first episode of the new buried
Drivers from Saturday will be able to use the first of three built mountain sections of the S7 expressway, i.e. the new Zakopianka – from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdroj and further the two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
As announced on Friday by the spokeswoman of the Kraków branch of the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) Iwona Mikrut, it is the first of three sections of the S7 being built south of Kraków, from Lubnia to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into service.
From the more than 6-kilometer section from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka more than a third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, it was conducted on viaducts.
Seventeen of them were created, including the longest and highest, measuring a kilometer long and 50 m high, and four small objects on the sewers at the Skomielna junction.
From this junction, exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to national road No. 28 and to the old DK7 run were led.
From the next junction, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 towards Nowy Targ and Zakopane and to DK7 to Chyżny and the state border with Slovakia.
On Zbójtecka Góra, a place of service for ILO travellers was established.
The expressway ends with the Zabornia junction in Rabka Zdrój, to which was added about a kilometer long two-way section of DK47 to Chabówka and there was included in the already existing two-way Chabówka – Rdzawka.
S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Zdrój and a new section of the national road No. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka were built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment amounted to approximately PLN 615 million.
The guarantee of the quality of the work performed will be valid for 10 years.
A fragment of the new Zakopianka, including 15.8 km with expressway parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubień – Repair, Repair – Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is performed by a Polish-Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section – the Italian company Astaldi, and the third – the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is nearly PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed from European Union funds under the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of co-financing is over PLN 1.3 billion.
A total of 38 engineering structures (bridges, viaducts, estakades) and a two-chamber tunnel of 2.06 km are being constructed throughout this section.
According to the announcement of the road manager, a 7.6-kilometer section of Lubień – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7 will be available later this year, which drivers will bypass to build the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – Skomielna Biała with a length of approx. 3 km, drivers will drive in 2021, after the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of each strand of approx. 2.06 km.
Our goal is a welfare state
"We are building a welfare state in Poland," announced Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to urge a vote for the councillor Dariusz Matecki, who was running for the Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the welfare state," the minister said.
"We want Poles to earn much better, so that their lives are at a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that it committed to doing four years ago.
We said we'd introduce a 500 plus program.
Platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said that it was impossible that this money simply did not exist.
We proved that money was and was, only PO didn't care about those they were supposed to go to."
Ziobro also reminded about the children's package and the thirteenth retirement – and the fact that the fourteenth pension is also planned.
In addition to the "wise distribution of national income", PiS's priorities are fair state and economic development.
Money should not go into the pockets of the chosen, who have a good relationship with the establishment and power, but should go evenly to the whole society," he said.
Emmanuel Macron pays tribute to Jacques Chirac
French President Emmanuel Macron said goodbye on Thursday in a televised address by his predecessor Jacques Chirac; he called him a great Frenchman and a great statesman.
At 9 p.m., the lights of the Eiffel Tower went out in tribute to the former president.
Former French President and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac died Thursday morning at the age of 86.
Macron's farewell speech broadcast all of France's major television channels.
"He was a statesman we loved, just as he loved us," the president said.
"Over 40 years in politics have made Chirac's face close to ours.
And whether we shared his ideals, his battles or not, we all recognized each other in this man.
This evening is an evening of gratitude to Jacques Chirac.
He has done so much for the nation, for our values, brotherhood and tolerance," Macron continued.
He recalled that Chirac opposed the 2003 war against Iraq, which had no UN mandate, and sought peace in the Balkans, stability and peace in Lebanon.
Before his television appearance, Macron went to Chirac's Paris apartment on de Tournon Street.
At noon, the National Assembly celebrated the former president's passing with a minute of silence.
The Elysian Palace will be open from 9 p.m. on Thursday to Sunday evening to all those who wish to enter the book of condolences.
"The President of the Republic wants the French to be able to pay tribute to Jacques Chirac, who passed away today," the press service of the Elysée Palace said.
This palace was the home of Chirac for two presidential terms from 1995 to 2007.
President Macron declared Monday a day of national mourning.
There will be a solemn mass at St. Sulpicius' church at noon, and an official service according to tradition will be held at Notre-Dame Cathedral, which has been closed to the public since April, when the fire broke out there.
Jacques Chirac's funeral will be held next week; the exact date and details are not yet known.
Part of Sopotka Street in Nisko after the expansion
On Tuesday, September 24th, an expanded Sopocka Street in Nisko was solemnly handed over for operation.
The total value of this task amounted to PLN 1 million 803 thousand, of which PLN 26,000 was a grant from the FDS, while the remaining amount is an own contribution from the funds of the Niżański County and the Municipality and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the obtained means, among others, it was possible to make a surface at a length of 1284 meters with its widening, pavement at a distance of 950 meters, dehydration and finishing works.
The contractor of the investment was the Consortium of companies: PBI Infrastruktura S.A. from Kraśnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. from Sandomierz.
At the turn of 2019/2020, the district of Żański will implement a further stage of the expansion of Sopocka Street, as part of which a new pavement, pavement and a bridge on the Barcówka River will be constructed.
For the implementation of these works, the district authorities also managed to obtain funding from the FDS, at the level of 80% of the value of the entire investment.
The ceremonial handover of the rebuilt road was attended by: the starost of Niańsk Robert Bednarz, the vice-starosta Adam Mach, the chairman of the Niańsk County Council Sylwester Daśko, the chairman of the Malce Settlement Board Jan Bielak, employees of the District Office and the District Roads Board in Nisko, the contractor of the investment and the supervisor.
Facebook out of concern for users' well-being will hide the like counter on trial
As part of the world's first experiment to improve the well-being of users, some of the people using Facebook soon under the posts of others will not see the number of likes, reactions and video views.
The likes will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
A new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Facebook's privacy director in Australia, said the change was the result of a well-being study and the opinion of mental health professionals indicating that the likes counter may prompt comparisons with others.
"The feedback from the many anti-bullying groups working with us, as well as mental health organisations, was really positive," Garlick said.
By eliminating this counter, people will focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of their content, rather than the number of likes or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and not to be seen as a competition," she said.
Garlick ensured that companies that base their business on Facebook would continue to receive the same metrics and observations they had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to say whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be implemented permanently.
"Users' initial comments about the new Instagram rules have been positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to feedback," she said.
Speaking about the site of the global experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically knowledgeable Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with reliable opinions indicating whether a new experience is valuable for people using our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims from the curia
The Częstochowa curia does not yet comment on the appeal of the councillors to Archbishop Wenceslas Depo there to provide financial compensation for handling the waste economy during the pilgrimage season.
The city requests 1 zł from the pilgrim.
He spoke about the speech addressed to the Metropolitan on Friday at a press conference with the participation of, among others, Spring leader Robert Biedron, organized on the road leading towards Jasna Góra Częstochowa Avenue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, vice-president of the local city council and candidate for the Sejm Łukasz Kot.
Kot reported that the day before, local councillors of the SLD had voted for an appeal to Archbishop Wenceslas Depo to donate one zloty from every pilgrim visiting Częstochowa – to support the work of municipal services, municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up after the pilgrims, prepare the city for the pilgrims.
"We ask that you donate to the budget of the city a symbolic buck from each pilgrim.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions for their stay in Częstochowa", said the vice-president of the city council.
Asked to comment, the spokesman of the Metropolitan Curia of Częstochowa, Fr Mariusz Bakalarz initially prepared a several-course response, but then asked – as he signalled, at the behest of Archbishop Depo – to replace it with the following information: "Until we receive the official position of the city council, we do not refer to the case".
According to the project posted on the pages of the Częstochowa magistrate, the appeal to Archbishop Depo concerns "the transfer of financial compensation for the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of servicing the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, bearing in mind the image of the city among the inhabitants, pilgrims and pilgrims, we wish within the generally accepted canons to take care of our common good, the small homeland of Częstochowa, to propose participation in the costs of servicing the above-mentioned garbage system," reads the passage of the appeal.
"Wanting to maintain the cleanliness of the foot-and-road trains that pilgrims move, using at the same time a small infrastructure, i.e. external waste bins, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim", it was written.
"Additionally, due to participation in the annual costs that the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of the urban space, and wishing to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the above amount will be spent on improving tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available to the public," the councillors declared.
They pointed out that in addition to financial issues, their proposal stems from numerous objections raised by residents as to the state of cleanliness of the routes by which pilgrims move.
"Considering the care for the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the City Council of Częstochowa appeals to the Archbishop of Częstochowa, Wacław Depo, to provide financial compensation for the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrim season," the appeal was repeated.
According to the information of the press office of Jasna Góra, 834,000 people participated in 200 nationwide pilgrimages to this sanctuary.
About 124,000 faithful arrived in 255 pedestrian pilgrimages.
Over 8.8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the shrine on horseback, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on roller skates.
"News" TVP omitted the Confederacy when describing the poll
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, PiS would gain 45 percent of the votes in the elections to the Sejm, KO 26 percent, Left 14 percent, PSL 7 percent, and Confederation 5 percent.
The crossing of the electoral threshold was even written on the "Super Express" portal, for which a probe was conducted.
In the main issue of News, describing the same poll, the results of only the first four parties were presented, completely bypassing the Confederacy.
The leader of Edyta Lewandowska clearly stressed that only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
TVP viewers were also shown the division of parliamentary seats without taking into account the votes cast for the Confederation.
This would give PiS independent rule.
Krzysztof Bosak, in his commentary on the whole situation, spoke of "public compromise on the issue of honesty towards society".
"They started with slogans about the 'moral revolution'", he recalled and stated that this case is a sign of a sense of weakness.
Robert Winnicki, in turn, tweeted that "TVP news" in subsequent actions against the Confederacy embarrass Urban and Michnik.
He also pointed out the lack of reaction from right-wing journalists.
"But let us also look at those who allow themselves to be silent.
These «right», «independent», «incorruptible».
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of everything they said they were fighting," he added.

"Also on 26 September 2019, the positions of NIK vice-presidents were dismissed: Ewa Polkowska, Wojciech Kutyła and Mieczysław Łuczak," the communiqué reads.
Earlier that day, motions for all these personnel decisions were given a positive opinion by the Sejm's Committee on State Control, except that the vote on the opinion until Ewa Polkowska's dismissal was held twice – in the first vote on the committee, the same number of MPs were in favour and against.
The new Vice President of NIK Małgorzata Motylow comes from Chełm Lubelski.
Brother Sentenced to Life Sentence for Killing Honorary Social Media Stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch's brother was found guilty on Friday of her murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most notorious "honour killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by posting bold selfies – polite by Western standards, but in heavily misogynistic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and stated that he had "obviously" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that a court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in the long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by a higher court," he said.
Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, had previously told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
The Baloch murder has hit the forefront of global news services and has resumed calls for action against the epidemic of so-called honor killings, in which victims – usually women – are killed for violating patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for such offenses as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing "shame" to their family by manifesting their own sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask their closest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation introducing a life sentence for honor killings.
However, whether or not a murder is considered an honourable offence remains the responsibility of the judge, which means that murderers can theoretically invoke another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially insisted that their son should not be shown grace under any circumstances.
However, devastated by the thought that they might lose him too, they changed their minds and declared that they wanted his acquittal.
The international outrage caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself an heir with his parents, thus forcing the case to move forward.
One of Baloch's more famous achievements is offering to strip in front of the Pakistani cricket team and wearing a decoiled purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as breaking the boundaries in a country where posing as a Kim Kardashian-style figure could be considered a bold and political move to empower women.
The roots of "honourable" killings lie in tribal social norms that continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular, they normalize women's behavior, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced persons from northwestern Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations said the escalating violence has caused the number of displaced people from northwestern Nigeria to double to about 40,000 in the last four months.
The UN refugee agency said the unrest created a "new humanitarian emergency" that requires an interagency effort to raise $35.5 million in new funds by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north of the country for a decade, was not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of the actions of organized armed groups.
"It paints a terrifying picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He has reported frequent reports of kidnappings, torture, extortion, murder, and sexual assault by attackers who also destroy homes and steal possessions.
Military and police forces were sent to fight criminal gangs in the region.
However, the military is being pulled away from fighting Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in West Africa, which emerged from its former grouping in 2016.
"Refugees don't come with group names," he said.
They come for it with monstrous stories.
Refugees mostly make their way to neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said he expects more people to flee to Niger in the coming months as the security situation worsens, particularly in Sokoto State.
A new date has been set for the trial of a man accused of killing a woman and two children.
A new trial date has been planned for a Guatemalan man accused of killing a Iowa state woman and her two children.
According to the Polk County District Court records, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is charged with three first-degree murders under what authorities claim to be a false name he originally gave to police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He pleaded not guilty.
According to police, he fatally shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter, and her 5-year-old son on July 16 at their home in Des Moines.
The court records show that the new date of the trial, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials say Escobar-Orellana resides in the United States illegally and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegally entering the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson facing a cabinet revolt seeking to lower Brexit demands and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country surrounded by the Prime Minister, there are growing fears that he will not have enough time to gain more important concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of mutiny from the cabinet seeking to lower demands over Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
There was a deadlock in the negotiations over a new customs system to replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels described proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "unfeasible".
The Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, led by Germany's head Angela Merkel, to offer the criticized Tory leader a compromise at the last minute in the form of a three-year time limit to implement the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists spoke to three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual Tory conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominik Cummings, which consists of trying to apply bluffs to the EU and threatening to leave the Union without a deal, and then accepting the offer made at the last minute by the Union.
One cabinet minister described the devastating Supreme Court verdict ruling on Tuesday to end the suspension of parliament as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on October 31 is to do so on a contractual basis.
We will never defeat arithmetic in the House of Commons, which works to our disadvantage.
The Prime Minister must now bow down and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious Cummings' plan burned to the ground.
We can't fight battles on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister pledged to tell Johnson to try and push through the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else fails.
The minister said, "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-present in the House of Commons the agreement proposed by Theresa May."
There are many chances to vote it out, and everyone is very keen on ending the topic.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a stingy speech, the former Tory minister said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wants a deal with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he wrestles with bulls in Scotland, checks eggs in Wales, and fights with citizens on the main streets of cities – all in front of the world, as if an election campaign was already underway for good."
A spokesman for the current prime minister admitted yesterday that the deal is still a long way off, and added: "No one should have illusions: it's a very long way to secure an agreement."
However, the spokesman also said that the Benn Act implementing the postponement of Brexit by three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiations, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his co-workers, through hard work, are still trying to make progress."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will hold more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss the book on how the zone works for all of Ireland for food and livestock.
A dog with no nose and no leg conquers Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The mongrel was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
A photo of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with a pet at first sight.
"Initially, I had a hard time convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided that she would look after the bitch until someone adopted her.
Still no one came forward.
"The fact that no one wanted her made me want to deal with her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Eventually, the couple decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, that's his problem, not ours," the woman said.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
More than 14,000 internet users follow her on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career in television
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV chiefs said that due to the Glasgow accent, she would "never make a career" as a presenter.
Reminiscing about her 35-year career in the television industry, Kelly, 59, admitted that before her first appearance on screen, she felt "much nervous".
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and information checker, the chief of chiefs said that because of my Glasgow accent, I would never be successful on television.
I went to London to meet the entire TV-am team and watch the show before I took over from the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget the interview with star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to stay.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV-am correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then began running shows such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak", and later launched with her morning show "Lorraine", which she took from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will celebrate with a special program, during which she will reminisce about her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long stint on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity", adding: "It takes hard work.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interested and interesting.
When she recalls the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was "very difficult" for her to report on the Dunblane bombing.
I had no idea that many families of children killed or injured were watching our show live from Dunblane the day after the horrific killing of sixteen children and their teacher.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me to have a private meeting during which we talked at her house for hours.
The entire meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, which I attended.
She added that it was "extremely difficult" to interview Kate and Gerry McCanna shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that she "really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition, endure the most horrible comments of online trolls.
I am with them with all my heart.
Lorraine Kelly's 35th anniversary program on television will begin at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30 on ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga feared imprisonment
A senior civil servant claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga rejected an offer to take office as president made by the late President Robert Mugabe at the height of the coup, as he feared imprisonment to confirm the military's seizure of power in November 2017.
As The Zimbabwe Independent reported last week, Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenda to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military as part of the coup.
However, a senior government official stated on social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer out of fear, but because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during the coup.
In a thread on Twitter that confirmed that the 37-year-old Zimbabwean ruler wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwendze, not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, about which state officials confirmed that he was a senior civil servant at the President's Office and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that intense negotiations were going on at the time.
Government officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was slipping out of his hands.
Mediation between military authorities and the late former president had three stages, according to a senior government official.
The official claimed that among the participants in the negotiations was President George Charamba's spokesman, the then head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper, and a cleric representing the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to hand over the offer to the presidency of Chiwenda, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SAZ).
A man who was considered an icon of Africa after his death tried in vain to obtain from the AU a condemnation of military action, trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defense Force (SSO) Chiwendze, was not the result of an election.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation, which gained a dangerously fast pace by removing part of the deceased's family," wrote an official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political temptation by which the deceased wished to reverse the situation in a completely non-diplomatic way.
It is enough to recall that the commanders declared that they had not overthrown and would not overthrow the constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the AU's position on coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, abruptly interrupting the leaders' claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the AU, which, by the way, was still highly confused by the whole situation and the way it fit into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such calculation that this offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defensive forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe had been forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the strongman that he was risking Gaddafi-style lynching.
The military chiefs told him they would not return the rifles against the citizens if they moved on his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires, that is, to save his family and prove that the military took over," the official added.
The then SSO and commanders read the assumptions correctly.
The emissary (Gono) carrying this desperate message was given to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the camouflage sect, i.e. the military), we are not politicians or compete with each other on a political level, claimed a senior civil servant.
State officials say the military has notified military commanders in the area via attachés who were in Zimbabwe that they have no intention of overthrowing Mugabe, but of dealing with the "criminals" surrounding him.
Mugabe attempted to use the same strategy to again tempt Mnangagwa to return from a brief exile in South Africa so that they could talk about the coup and succession.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The people of South Africa, a key part of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that then-President Jacob Zuma was president of Sadc – refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the military invades Mugabe's house, as it has repeatedly threatened in the background, South African troops will immediately arrive in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," one source told the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or it will "dissolve" as stated in the policy paper
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, otherwise the country will "dissolve," the government said in a policy document issued Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in a white paper that the country's successes since the Communists took power 70 years ago were reduced to party leadership.
China occupies a large area, has complex domestic conditions, while administrative difficulties are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move towards division and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long followed a hard-hand policy when solving problems, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying this by the need to maintain the country's stability.
The ruling strong-arm president Xi Jinping, who will head the celebration of the anniversary of the world's second largest economy on Tuesday, since taking office in late 2012, has further tightened the party's rule and issued sanctions against those who may question power.
Xi also oversees a military modernization program that has put the region off balance.
The document stated that China does not seek to export its model of development or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not "hegemony".
The Chinese do not have in their genes the conquest of other nations or the domination of the world.
In modern times, China has been plagued by great powers, and wars and unrest have left a deep mark on them as a result of the suffering they have suffered; China will never inflict the suffering they have suffered on others.
China is celebrating this anniversary in uncertain times for a country embroiled in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in Hong Kong's subordinate China.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
Regarding the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that "the danger of trade wars and the further increase in tariffs do not lead to a solution to the problems."
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market place, and a strong rate of economic development.
The document added that "trade wars will never weaken her."
China is certain to be able to face difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It also added that the United States should rationally look at China's development, as China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely they will stop China's development.
Restricting and weakening other countries and transferring national misunderstandings abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
Jack Palkiewicz's World: Dubai, the Real Face
The Dubai emirate is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, religious Islamic radicalism and the extremism of progressiveness.
This trend-setting leader in world tourism awakens imagination and desire, smothering the vanity of wealthy snobbish hotels and attracting fortune-seeking investors and traders with the status of a tax haven.
Websites infect with enthusiasm this city of dreams, being an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentrate of 21st century architecture in one.
Built on oil-rich sands, the emirate has become Eden for those who love luxury, five-star hotels, beautiful weather, and pools hundreds of metres above the ground.
Many admire the pervasive splendor here, appreciate creative hyperactivism and hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
Here is a city whose motto says everything: "surprise, bewilder and charm".
And almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
As British writer Lawrence Osborne observes, "a metropolis full of extremes and contradictions has taken on a shoddy grotesque dimension."
It has evolved into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, the unofficial constitution of the emirate.
Because here everything has to be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
Amongst the thicket of excesses and ostentatious luxury, however, there is a lack of something that in old Europe is perhaps not very transparent, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
And certainly not in Dubai.
Fleeing from the world of witchcraft, I ripped off his golden mask, revealing the other face of artificial paradise.
A face that is not spoken of or written about.
I show the misery of Asians contrasting with the fairytale living conditions of the divine caste of ethnic Dubaians, the grandchildren of illiterate Bedouins.
I venture into places of extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where under cruel conditions there is an army of Asian workers.
It was they who, in a single generation, built in slave-like conditions reaching the skies of desert Manhattan.
They came here, seduced by good wages and the possibility of securing a decent life for their families, and found a nightmare.
This tourist will never see, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai created over the years.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labour highly troublesome for the emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls band banned diet talk from her home after her struggles with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls team admitted that there was a ban on dieting in her home, after she struggled with eating disorders herself, for years eating only fruits and vegetables.
For years, Spice did not eat and "obsessively exercised" due to the pressure of being a member of the world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences influence how she raises her daughter Scarlet, and therefore "she does not allow diets to be talked about in her home."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I'm beginning to see that she's more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the positives of the experience of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak with it.
The use of positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with Women's Health magazine, Mel, who rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls band, said that in the days before the rise of social media, the "outrageous" comments about her caused her complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain food groups, practicing more and more obsessively until I started to be underweight," he says.
"I was sick and it probably took a couple of years."
A picture that shook the world
A Polish girl and an American documentary filmmaker gave the world a witness to the cruelty of the war.
Legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen at the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!", began his radio appearance as a documentary filmmaker, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic days of September 1939 he was in the Polish capital, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His account echoed widely in the West.
Warsaw President Stefan Starzyński helped him first, lent him a car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the U.S., deposited it in the embassy safe, and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever Varsovians were.
400 aircraft and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan immortalized in the photographs the death, suffering, struggle to survive in the ruins of the city.
Just before the surrender, he and his embassy staff took the negatives overseas.
He kept talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London and even New York".
His shocking chronicles were watched by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon, the U.S. began preparing for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They made films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Trial in front of jury against former athlete accused of multiple rapes
A trial is pending in front of a jury in a rape case filed by a former baseball player at the University of Delaware, who is accused of multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, members of the jury proceeded to settle the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who turned 21 says Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The incident occurred three weeks after the two made friends on the Bumble meeting page and the man's sending a picture of him naked to the woman.
The woman is one of six accused of sexual assault by Conaway between 2013 and 2018.
According to the prosecutors, the hug that the woman consented to turned into rape, which was met with her opposition.
The defenders cite the conflicting relationship between the woman and the gaps in memory, and claim that the woman probably regretted that there was an intimate rapprochement.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
The gold-covered bicycle worth one million zlotys could be seen at the jubilee, 10th edition at the International Cycling Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
Its designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz just received a bicycle Oscar for it at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
An unusual copy made a furore at the fair. - The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, under it is the highest-sampling silver.
It's an unusual shell made by my friend from Żor.
"There's a saddle, there's pedals, there's a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," the designer says.
"The bike curtain was printed on a 3D printer.
They are cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea for this model while riding my first bike home, a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and hid it deep in a drawer.
The sketch waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was created three years," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
Inside are batteries, wires, elements that make up the structure.
This is hidden under the bodywork drawn in 11 pieces onto the steel frame of the bike.
There is also an engine hidden there.
The wheel for this bike was created a week before I left for the United States for the World Bicycle Show.
I couldn't quite decide what the steering wheel was going to be like.
She folds up for transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he concludes.
The gold-plated bike was recognized in Las Vegas' most important competition category of "Best Amazing Single Custom Copy".
Video footage shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay, surrounded by an opera building, Circular Quay port, Luna Park amusement park and of course the famous Harbour Bridge, makes a significant contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
However, there is an ugly truth hidden under the bridge.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, which is affected annually by a volume of pollution equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist assets at the same time one of our dirtiest reservoirs.
According to a new footage entitled "Sydney Bay – Up and Down", the waters in the area of Australia's most popular city are full of buttresses, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and pieces of clothing, and even dead animals, all flowing into the bay along with rainwater.
However, the largest component strangling our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a September 27 video, with the publication of this film deliberately coinciding with World Tourism Day.
This reservoir looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated estuaries along our coast.
The CSIRO agency estimates that about 1560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and that the greater part of it flows into the bay through storm sewerage.
"After such powerful rainfall, the bay ... looks quite tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the Sydney Bay problem is much more serious below the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean goes to the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you can't really realize what's in there deep down," said Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly, noting that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water on their own each year.
I think if more people knew (what's under the water), they'd just be scared.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find at the bottom are plastic meshes.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all that other garbage is being brought out right from under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways that people – both locals and tourists – could help reduce the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.
"It has to start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better conduct material recovery, and be more aware of what we are draining in the sewage that eventually goes into the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we are doomed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can sort out this bay and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves, too.
The footage, funded by the recycling company TOMRA as part of its broader effort to educate Australians about the environment and reduce the negative impact of beverage containers that often end up in the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health that was published this month.
A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 found that 82% of respondents felt helpless against plastic waste and 25% blamed adults for the single-use plastic packaging waste problem.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said their concerns about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans were growing.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after a volleyball match in the ME semi-final
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenes had a lively audience on their side, which effectively distracted Polish volleyball players.
A lot of controversy was also aroused by the judges, who in one of the actions did not count four rebounds on the side of the hosts.
This happened at a crucial point in the first set, when Vital Heynen's charges had a chance to jump off their rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles eventually had to recognize the superiority of the rival, who after winning 3:1 will play in the final of the tournament.
Ghana: Kaneshie traders support Accra mental hospital
Members of the Kaneshie Market Association gave food worth 30,000 GH yesterday to a mental hospital in Accra during a short ceremony held in Accra.
It is an element of activities as part of the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
The donation included, among others, various food items, fruits, soft drinks, biscuits, clothing, yams, paradise bananas, manioc, as well as bags of water.
During the visit, the group also spoke to several patients of the facility.
The event was attended by members of the management staff of Accra Markets Limited, directors of the association and queen mothers.
Presenting the items, Mrs. Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, president of the Women's Market Association of the Greater Accra Region, stated that the donation is part of the group's regular social responsibility charitable activities.
She noted that supporting care for the patients of the facility was necessary to show them love and allow them to feel part of society.
Mrs. Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow this gesture.
Accepting the gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, director of the hospital, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be used well for the benefit of patients.
She appealed to other organizations for support for the hospital.
Google is creating a cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
The cooperation is to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region in Warsaw – a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global public cloud computing in Central Europe.
Digitization of Polish enterprises was one of the key assumptions that laid the foundation for the project of creating the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.
The National Cloud Partnership and Google is another important step on the road we set out less than a year ago, announcing the establishment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – the digitization of the Polish economy and the dynamic growth of it.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools to implement it.
By using them, they increase their chances of being promoted to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins their group today significantly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
"Investment in the National Cloud Operator fits perfectly into the PFR strategy, as an important element of the country's digitization.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also positively affect the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it," adds Paweł Borys, president of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on a leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery in their service portfolio.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the National Cloud offer will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator, points out.
He adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the need for the computing power necessary to process huge data sets.
6th National Senior Parade
At noon, on 24 August 2019, at the Roundabout de Gaulle in Warsaw, the 6th Senior Parade "Mature of the Magnificent" and the Picnic of the Generations, events organized by the Zaczyn Foundation began.
As Przemysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation stated: "Parada is an event on a global scale.
This is the sixth time she has passed through the centre of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse the community is made up of seniors.
Through the Parade, we counter harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was led by a special double-decker coach serving as a musical mobile stage, on which the traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wika performed.
Participants in the joyful cordow, at the second known Warsaw and world hits, crossed the Jerozolimski Avenues, Krucza Street to Warsaw Insurgents Square, Mazowiecka Street to J. Piłsudski Square, and Królewska and Krakowskie Przedmieście Street to the Main Campus of the University of Warsaw.
During the march, which was attended by several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organizations from all over Poland, colorful delegations were greeted with applause by numerous marches gathered on the route, Varsovians and tourists.
Two organized groups appearing in company yellow and blue shirts took part in the parade from Legionowo.
The first representing the University of the Third Age and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name SAGA, or Senior Active Animators Group.
On the campus, the organizers prepared, among others, food stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the stand of Style Senior Voice Seniors from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrwył, it was possible to get tips and information on current trends in 60+ fashion.
The stand also offered a workshop on learning how to move around the stage and posing for photos.
The culmination was the Fashion Show of Stylish Seniors.
The stand of the National Voice of the Senior included the latest edition of the magazine and materials related to the campaign "Stop Manipulation – Don't Buy at Presentation!".
Subsequent stands offered beauty, movement, art and art workshops.
On a few it was possible to do research and consult with specialists in health and nutrition issues.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadli, Mariola Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow or Robert Janowski.
There was no shortage of vocal and musical attractions at the picnic.
The stage featured the legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening an intergenerational dance was held, which was led by DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide clues on how to treat cancer
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that could revolutionize patient therapy
Researchers in the field of medicine have discovered a way to mask certain cancer cells
The researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients.
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including those from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that could help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treating deadly tumors within the face that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way to mask some cancer cells in both humans and marsupials, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which disables a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This may pose the greatest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and a type of skin cancer called Merkel cell cancer.
"The huge significance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immune therapies, we may be able to reverse this process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-inclusion of markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
"This potentially has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can treat her a lot better.
The researchers also hope that the discovery will one day be used to treat the face tumors of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is remarkable that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
"So far, it has been very difficult to treat tumors of Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists surprised by the fact that a very large planet orbits a really small star
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of a solar system 30 light-years from Earth that challenges our current understanding of planet formation, as in this system a large Jupiter-like planet orbits a small star called a red dwarf.
Artist's illustration of a gas giant planet, GJ 3512b, orbiting a red dwarf central star, published September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting them.
However, as scientists stated on Thursday, in this case the star and planet differ slightly in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 makes up about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Space Research Institute at the Spanish Space Research Institute, who spearheaded a study published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low-mass stars tend to become parent stars for smaller Earth-like planets or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a planet of the Jupiter-like gas giant type orbiting a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star in a very elliptical orbit, and a full orbit lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent is comparable in size to that of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below Kelvin's 3800 (degrees) (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have a reddish color," Morales said.
"There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet may have been ejected from the star system in the past, which may explain the elliptical orbit of a Jupiter-like planet," Morales said.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to the leading model of planet formation called the accretion model, initially the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity of the planet in its early stage of development allows for the formation of an atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual arrangement can explain a competitive model called the gravitational instability model.
"In that case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than we expect, and it may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to disk stability disturbances, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can build up until the planet collapses and forms.
Delicacy worker accused of serving bean dip coworkers containing methamphetamine
The Marion County Sheriff's Office detained Cassandra Medina-Hernanndez, 38, for giving her co-workers a bean dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, Albany-based 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernanndez was charged with supplying methamphetamine and causing the consumption of that substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The prosecution was based on the September 9 incident at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a statement obtained by OregonLive.com under oath pointing to the likelihood of guilt, a 27-year-old suspect's associate told Marion County Sheriff's deputies that during her lunch break, she saw Medina-Hernanndez making a bean dip, which she then gave her.
Based on the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who according to what she passed on to investigators, never took methamphetamine, said that she "thought that one piece she ate tasted strangely, but it did not raise any suspicions about it."
When she returned to work, she felt that she had a stomach upset and that she could not stand.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital where it was determined that the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine.
Based on reports from The Smoking Gun, police said another Thriftway employee told her that Medina-Hernandez "told her that she would add drugs to her food" while another one admitted that the suspect sent her a message claiming that methamphetamine had gone into the bean dip by accident.
The OregonLive website reports a surveillance recording from the delicatessens, which allegedly shows how a back-facing Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, stands behind the microwave, and leans.
Then she straightens herself, wipes her nose, comes to the table and puts the bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was also probably on a plate.
The Oregon Statesman-Journal newspaper reports that sheriff's office employees say there is currently no suspicion that customers will be given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Jail with a bond of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, methamphetamine delivery, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of prohibited weapons.
Johnson takes a blow in the turmoil surrounding the postponement
Boris Johnson's trip to the United Nations General Assembly was inelegantly interrupted by a historic Supreme Court ruling.
However, his devastating speech in the House of Commons did not betray either shame or remorse.
To explain the meaning of this coup, Tony Connelly, editor of the European section of the RTE in Brussels, and London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, are in the eye of the cyclone.

"The Slovenes played very well in every element.
Too bad about the end of the sets, because we had our chances, but we didn't take them.
We are not hanging our heads, because on Saturday the match for the bronze medal", said the quarterback of the Polish volleyball team Marcin Komenda after the defeat against Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-final of the European championship.
A talented player appeared on the field in the second and third sets.
According to some, Vital Heynen should give him a better chance to show his skills.
However, Eagles' selector put on the experience of Fabian Drzyzga.
"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": auditions for the role of Jamie New on the West End
Another big West End star is waiting to be discovered, though she doesn't know it yet.
"Everybody's Talking About Jamie" producers are looking for another Jamie New and holding open auditions
The current star Layton Williams embarks on a musical tour of the UK, so the producers in his place are looking for an "uniquely talented, undiscovered young performer".
Hearings in London will be held on October 10 at the Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 bars of the opening track "Don't Even Know It", as well as their resume and portrait photo.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and the following week the producers will be presented again by those invited to the presentation.
Producer Nica Burns said, "We are pleased to say that thanks to our fantastic audience, the musical will be played for the next, third year at Apollo."
We found some fantastic young performers who will join Layton Williams and Shane Richie on the tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical, we open up opportunities for unknown talents to join the current young professionals.
Williams, who took on the role of Jamie New in February and thus replaced John McCre originally playing the role, urged on Twitter "ALL the boys to send their tapes":
The tour of this musical will begin in February, with performances at the West End being extended to 29 August 2020.
The musical depicts the fate of 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the prom at the end of school wearing a dress.
He doesn't know what the future holds, but he's sure he'll become a star.
With the help of her mother and the local drag community legend, Loco Chanelle begins exploring her identity, defying prejudice, and pursuing a career in the light of flashes.
The music in this show was inspired by the BBC documentary entitled "Jamie. Drag Queen at 16" by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and song lyrics by Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval acquires SEK 110 million contract in the natural gas industry
Alfa Laval – a world leader in district heating, centrifugal separation and liquid transport – has won an order to supply an air cooler installation to a gas processing plant in the US. This order is worth approximately 110 million Swedish kronor and has been registered in the Welding Heat Exchanger Division of the Vertical Energy Division, and deliveries are planned for 2020.
The order includes the installation of Alfa Laval Niagara air coolers, which will be used as part of the refrigeration systems to separate natural gas into individual streams of its pure components – ethane, propane and butane.
Safety is critical in all industrial processes and is extremely important in demanding natural gas processing applications.
"Our reliable air cooler installations are recognized for their safe operation, which provides peace of mind for customers in the natural gas industry," says Susanne Pahlen Aklundh, President of the Energy Division.
Did you know that... ethane, propane and butane can be extracted from natural gas and then used, for example, as input material for petrochemical installations, home heating or as fuel for vehicles?

Marian Banas.
What is KAS doing about the head of NIK?
Renting real estate for an amount below the market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
We asked about what the treasury does in this matter in the Chamber of Revenue Administration in Kraków and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in a report for TVN's "Superwizjer" presented doubts about the property statements of the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
It has been investigated by the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau for several months.
The audit is expected to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a tenement house of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received $65,700 a year for this.
A report by "Superwizjera" revealed that the tenement he rented housed a hotel for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on state television why he only charged just over 5 thousand zlotys per month for renting real estate.
"Gazeta Wyborcza", citing real estate valuation experts, estimated that it should be PLN 15,000 per month for the tenement itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I made a preliminary agreement and it was precisely that the tenant was to buy this tenement that caused me to agree to a lower rent, that the remaining receivables would be settled when the tenement was sold," Banaś argued.
However, there have been doubts as to whether such conduct is not an infringement.
Konrad Zawada, a spokesman for the Chamber of Revenue Administration in Kraków, in an interview with TVN24, reported that "this matter is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance".
"Any such questions should be addressed to the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "the activities are carried out by the National Revenue Administration".
Press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Revenue Administration monitors many cases on its own, which may raise some objections.
"The National Revenue Administration acts in such a way that it has its own information, as well as relies in a sense on that information that is publicly available.
On this basis, he decides whether or not to conduct any particular case," a spokesman for the MF explained.
"However, due to the fact that we are all bound by fiscal secrecy throughout the finance department, we never speak out because we cannot speak out on individual issues of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," he emphasized, when asked about the case of Marian Banasia.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "Treasury offices do not report this type of news to the public".
"It is known that the entire treasury apparatus deals with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the Royal Family: Surprising Guests Often Flying in a Royal Plane Revealed
As part of their official duties, members of the royal family must go on hundreds of trips around the world during their lifetimes.
This is usually facilitated by a royal plane – a private machine that carries the royal family around the world for important events and speeches.
It is no surprise that having your own plane comes with privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long lines for check-in, their baggage limits do not apply, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests on board – including those really unheard of.
According to the recently premiered Channel 5 documentary, it is not just the Queen and Prince Philip who often travel by royal plane.
During the program titled "Secrets of Royal Flight," the former Queen's flight navigator revealed that furry guests often flew with the royal family.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly."
It is not surprising that the Queen may have wished her beloved favourites to accompany her on her travels, as she is known for her deep attachment to corgi dogs.
From an early age, Queen Elizabeth was a lover of these four-legged creatures, and it has been rumored that she has owned more than 30 corgis since her coronation.
She is said to have had five corgis in 2007: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick, and Span, as well as four dog cross-breasted dachshunds with corgis: Cider, Berry Vulcan, and Candy.
The crew of the royal plane certainly had their hands full.
An employee of the royal house was seen walking the dogs and asking them to take care of their needs before taking them on board the plane, Shields continues.
I'm pleased to say that there's never been an incident.
The program also revealed a shocking amount of baggage that the queen takes with her on board while traveling as part of her official duties.
The film's narrator stated, "In 1953, the Queen took baggage weighing 12 tons on her 70,000-kilometer journey."
To be able to picture it better, it's about the same as two huge elephants.
However, the Queen is not the only person with a weakness for fashion.
It is said that the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own preferences regarding the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that a separate seat is assigned to each of her dresses.
The new law comes into force.
Accident victims will receive pensions
On Friday, a regulation is coming into force to ensure that those seriously affected by accidents continue to pay their pensions, the Financial Ombudsman reports.
It is about the Act of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of persons injured in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee sum determined on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns people who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the time, there were much lower guarantee sums than today, hence in some cases insurers have already stopped paying annuities.
"I am happy with this regulation, because our institution has been striving for many years to create a mechanism that will allow to provide those seriously injured in accidents with a guarantee of financial support from motor insurance or farmer's OC despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum," says Aleksander Daszewski, legal counsel at the office of the Financial Ombudsman.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary, because these are often very tragic situations involving people in very poor health who, due to an accident, cannot work, and at the same time bear significant costs of post-accident rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensatory pensions and for increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums on OC policies.
Parts of it threatened in the coming years.
By January 1, 2006, the insurer's liability limits were significantly lower than the current one.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years most often affected people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
Back then, the guarantee totals were very low, and the economic conditions caused prices to rise.
"We also noticed that this problem was also affected by a number of mostly young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount of the sum was EUR 350,000 for each injured person in the accident.
It currently stands at 5.21 million euros per event, regardless of the number of victims.
So this is a huge difference from earlier periods, hence the problem required the intervention of the legislator", recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
He explains that since the guarantee sum is increased from time to time, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of the liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund would be the guarantee sum in force at the time of the claim for the payment of an annuity to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance company is not obliged to pay an annuity on the basis of a court decision fixing a different amount of the guarantee sum than that fixed in the civil liability insurance contract.
This is the case when the sum of the guarantee is increased by court pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows modification of the existing liability relationship.
"In recent days, we have sent letters to people who in the past have asked us to intervene.
In them we inform about the new powers and of course we provide the possibility of providing further support in the event of any problems", says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend had shown her friends the sex tape that had been made in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect by education, explained to the court that her partner had thus ruined her life and treated her like a "trofeum" that can be boasted of in front of friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
A Cordoban woman decided to do justice on her own.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
Using a velvet band, she blindfolded him, then grabbed the secateur and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pulled up my pants and grabbed my cell phone to call an ambulance," the victim testified.
"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by exposing the sex tape, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said to the jury.
She was eventually found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards has died at the age of 91.
On Friday, retired Alabama Republican Congressman Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms, died and was part of the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
A family spokesman said Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after battling pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Alabama Republicans in the Deep South due to the party gaining supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its great-grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like to return courtesy.
"I hope that my great-grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will grow up in a country where kindness will return to the common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said, according to the family statement.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of integrity.
She added that in his honor, the flag on the Alabama State Capitol would be lowered to half mast.
"He was the epitome of a true civil servant and was the best statesman for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of its most prominent politicians," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle an "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high praise for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the pattern and makes our world better."
The Duchess and Prince Harry, now on a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archi Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the youth earlier this week during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, the Duchess of Sussex, the 'sussexroyal,' a caring leader who breaks the charts and makes our world better," wrote the former first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether it's meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation or helping girls around the world get the education they deserve is an inspiration to a lot of people," Obama added, posting a picture of smiling Meghan posing with the foundation's leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, guest-edited by the former actress of the TV series Suits.
In a frank conversation there was a first lady talking about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means leading to a mastery of the art of letting go," Obama said in an interview.
"Motherhood has taught me that most of the time it's my job to give my children space so they can get to know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are at heart.
Obama, who by experience knows the pressure of being on the candlestick, shared the advice with the Duchess during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – imposed by yourself and others – can overwhelm you sometimes," she said.
"So my advice is to slow down and not rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughter, making sure they were doing well at school and making new friends before I devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think that's what's needed, too.
Trump Hotel retains liquor sales permit despite complaint about owner's disposition
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Washington, D.C. Alcohol Control Commission rejected a motion seeking to see whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its liquor sales permit due to the owner's disposition.
The agency ordered Wednesday that a complaint by three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded because most of them do not live in the district or own real estate in it.
The Washington Post reports that for the second time, these plaintiffs are seeking to revoke the hotel's liquor sales permit, citing the district's provision that applicants for liquor sales licenses must show a "good disposition."
In the original complaint filed last summer, it was claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and accusations of assault and repeated cases of fraud were invoked.
The complaint was dismissed because the permit was granted before it was filed.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the permit.
'The Sun': Crushing Report Finds Cleveland Police Service Scandals Worst in Britain
The inspectors found SCOMPROMISED SKANDALS to be the worst in the UK.
In a crushing report, they rated the Cleveland Police Department's work as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate says there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in the Cleveland Police Department.
There have been new calls for the dissolution of police services, headed by five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police did not make any efforts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the most vulnerable.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate said, "Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards."
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious" but undisclosed allegations of his conduct.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts was suspended after his arrest on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before a commission of misdemeanors for grooming female coworkers for sexual activities.
He left the service.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: "This is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office department to intervene now."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said, "After improvements have been made, I take full responsibility for bringing the police force through change."
We have a skatepark visualization!
Will the young finally wait?
Older residents are disturbed by young enthusiasts riding scooters and skateboards, in turn they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oława.
Young people have been demanding for years a place to ride roller skates, skateboards, scooters, bicycles.
The subject keeps returning to our pages.
We have been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Lately it has become loud again about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we go back to it again and ask at the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago a woman spoke, who is disturbed by the youth, driving in the center.
"I am writing on behalf of the residents of the block at Piłsudski Square, so that the situation of Oława youth can be interested," writes Małgorzata.
"The residents of the block called the City Guard repeatedly unsuccessfully.
As proof of such everyday situations in the attachment I send pictures".
We asked others what they thought about it.
Most clearly state that young people simply have no place to go in the city and have been unsuccessfully demanding a place for themselves for years.
There was an avalanche of comments under the Facebook post.
As early as July, we wrote that there is a chance for a skatepark to be built in Oława Miasteczko.
The mayor reported that the city had applied for funding to build a skate park.
"A youth-consulted project with permits is ready.
On 28 March, an application was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding of the task entitled «Construction of the Skatepark in Oława» as part of the Sportowa Polska programme", we were told in the office.
Total value of the project: 798 306.00 zł.
Requested amount of funding: 263 440,00 zł.
Now we've asked again what stage the case is at.
"We do not yet have information regarding the decisions on the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism", informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the Faculty of European Funds of UM Oława.
"From the information obtained from the Ministry staff, it appears that in the end the selection of all tasks under the Sport Poland Programme should take place in October".
We also asked for a visualization of the Oława skate park.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editorial board that they will be collecting signatures next Saturday (28 September) under a petition regarding the construction of a skatepark in Oława.
"Rebellious youths saw the last post on Facebook and concluded that they would organize a fundraiser," writes Mikołaj.
Signatures under the petition will be collected from 12.00 p.m. in the Lidl market area.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 of the final.
We know couples, a hit from years ago
It was one of the fiercest competitions in the extra-class.
The biggest legend was the memorable match from the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took up a team in the penultimate line at the old stadium in Łazienkowska.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, Widzew second consecutive Polish championship gave a point.
Up to the 87th minute Legia led 2-0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the Lodz club became more and more in trouble, until it ceased to count in the fight for the championship and fell from the top of the competition class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – on her way to the title – won two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 away.
Back to the Elite
Currently, the boatmen are fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least a year, as in previous games being one of the favorites they failed to advance to the back of the extra-class.
Due to this failure in the summer, there was a staff revolution at the club.
The authorities changed, eventually Marcin Kaczmarek was put on the coach, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy are to help the seasoned in the league battles Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżeń.
For now, Widzew is fourth in the table of the 2nd league, but in the Polish Cup he defeated the runner-up of the Śląsk Wrocław 2-0 extra-class on Tuesday.
Legia in the same size played away Puszcza Niepołomice.
Extra-class start

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "rebellious" and the impeachment investigation must go its own way
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are participating in an attempt to conceal the facts of an attempt to conceal the facts, and the investigation may take time," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.
"They will do the work they started by sticking to the facts and the time necessary to find them," she added.
According to the White House minutes released this week, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the matter, according to the protocol.
Trump denied that he had done anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had notified a whistleblower-reported complaint regarding Trump's conduct with Ukraine more than a week before the formal filing.
After receiving a complaint as a filing from officials at the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department stated that Trump's phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign funding.
When asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi stated that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call as a witness.
She added, however, that she believed Barr "rebelled."
This condition has been going on for a long time.
"After all, (Barra) lists himself in all this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general during a July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It is interesting that he made decisions about how to handle the complaint.
Pelosi stated that she was "very afraid" of whistleblower whistleblowers Trump attacked Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past, spies were handled differently.
I think the President's words go beyond irresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our whistleblowers play an important role in uncovering – exposing misdemeanors in our government," Pelosi said, adding "the President's words about those who can provide information to whistleblowers seriously undermine honesty in government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal investigation into the commission of an illegal act based on allegations of trying to pressure a foreign state leader for political gain.
The phone call was included in a complaint released Thursday in which a whistleblower claimed Trump abused his power to "incite Ukraine to interfere" during the upcoming 2020 election.
The whistleblower also charged that White House lawyers had ordered officials to remove the recording of the conversation from the computer system where it is stored for the needs of Council of Ministers officials and place it in a system designed for sensitive information.

Possible driving ban for excessive speed for Crystal Palace club striker Christian Benteke
Premier League star Christian Benteke, who has been caught speeding twice in the past two months, faces a driving ban.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old attacker admitted to driving a Bentley brand car at 80 mph in the grounds with a limit of 50 mph on the A3 road in Richmond, south-west London on January 20.
Then in March, the speed cameras in Putney, south-west London, recorded a Belgian speeding at 89 mph, which is twice the limit of 40 mph.
Kingston Hill Benteke of Surrey doesn't have to appear at the Lavender Hill Peace Court this morning.
He pleaded guilty to both offences in early July as part of a simplified procedure under which lighter offences are judged in a sitting conducted by a single justice of the peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasaacas club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Association of Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of Commission President Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the result of the verification process is in his interest.
The Review Committee should be composed of neutral outsiders who show no links to any of the members and who have not previously shown any interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer regarding a 10 percent payment.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position on the Verification Commission because he has an interest in doing so," he claimed.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games, were to stand before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President due to his association with the club, while suggesting that if Palmer were to stand before the Commission, he would be subject to prejudice and bias.
As expected, the members of the Commission were to begin work from yesterday, after being sworn in at a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, September 19, and end on October 4.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are Corporate Governance Consultant and Lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director, and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.
"SE": Kornel Morawiecki in severe condition in hospital
Senior Marshal Kornel Morawiecki, Solidarity legend and the father of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, went back to the hospital – reports "Super Express".
The politician is in serious condition.
78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki has been struggling with pancreatic cancer for many months.

Israel: No agreement on unity government
Israel's two major parties, the Blue and White Alliance and the Likud, continued negotiations on Friday to form a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the President entrusted the mission to form a government to Benjamin Netanyahu, failed to produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanyahu as prime minister, but – as the Israeli daily Haarec writes – there was no rapprochement of views.
The talks will resume on Sunday.
The centre-level Blue-White alliance reported in a communiqué that it had presented preliminary postulates.
He accuses the right-wing Likud of having "dounded himself in his positions", demanding that his leader and former prime minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and that the cabinet – the ultra-Orthodox politicians who had been part of it before.
"From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-Whites would not agree to these terms," the statement said.
For Likud, acting solely in Netanyahu's interest, wants to "bring Israel to the second round of elections".
Blue-White leader Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanyahu would have headed as long as he faces accusations of involvement in three corruption scandals, on the basis of which the prosecution could formally prosecute him after a meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
"The Likud and Blue-Whites won a sufficient majority in the September 17 election that would allow them to rule together as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate that neither side wanted," the EFE news agency wrote.
President Reuwen Rivlin has sought to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed the establishment of a "rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take that position if accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalized.
There is no shortage of Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll published by public television on Friday, want to unlock the political situation in the country by setting up a unity government under the rotating leadership of Netanyahu and Gantz.
50.6 percent of Israelis are in favour of such a solution, 32.1 percent of those surveyed are against such a solution.
The poll shows a deep divide in Israeli society – when asked who should be the first to lead the cabinet, 41.8 percent of respondents are in favor of Netanyahu, and 40 percent are in favor of Gantz.
In another poll published by the newspaper Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63 percent, 60 percent are opposed to new elections, which would be third this year.
In an early parliamentary election on September 17, he won Gantz's alliance, winning 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu with his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 MPs, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties collected the 61 seats necessary to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls for fight before final match against Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check in" when Wales is facing a final match against Australia as part of the World Cup that could shape their fate in the tournament.
Wales' victory over the "kangaroos" would put this team in the position of a certain favourite to win Group D and guarantee itself a share of the likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeat Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 matches, Tipuric and his team will be immediately sent back at the start against England as part of the one-eighth final.
"Let's be clear, both teams want to try to get through this and be at the head of the group," said Welsh roach Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last fall it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be anxious to take that victory away from us, and we want to get it back.
By the time we got here, you knew this was going to be a big start.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check it out.
Wales had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and that was 32 years ago in a third-place match when they defeated the "kangura".
And their total record under head coach Warren Gatland shows only seven wins in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the Southern Hemisphere.
Wales stopped a string of thirteen losing test matches at the hands of Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of this 9-6 win who would run to Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
When asked if the team had experienced a mental block before this victory, Tipuric added: "It's hard to say.
These games are so even that maybe... people expect there to be some kind of mental blockage, I don't know.
In the end, we probably left about 15 points on the field in the last match, so the final result looks like a much smaller advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then Tipuric's fight against the beloved Australian third-line duo of the mill Michael Hooper and David Pocock while stopping and knocking down will be essential.
Tipuric has played 67 games in the national team's colours and has met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"They're players playing in the seventh absolutely world-class position," he said.
When you play against world-class players of the third line of the mill, it is always known that there will be a difficult match to play.
These two constantly perform with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of gameplay to expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels rugby better because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and challenge yourself than to face the third line of the mill, which is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and when dealing with these two, you definitely need to be in top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday is almost the cup final, but for us it's an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is an essential part of it.
When we build strength and constantly put in a lot of effort, we will fly like wings and it will be hard to beat us.

"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization of the "lords' race".
They accepted into their ranks those whom they despised.
Can crime combine more strongly than national identity?
In your hands we don't give another book about war or military issues.
We are giving a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries analyze the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at the recruitment processes at particular stages of the war.
Were the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a unit made up of Poles themselves?
What does the official historical narrative of collaborations in individual European countries look like today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, these questions are answered by the book "Waffen-SS" based on solid research material.
We have sought to present a more subtle and more balanced, more accurate picture of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, trying also to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of history by presenting dissertations by researchers from different countries. (...) While the fate of the main victims of this war - forced laborers, Jews, captives, political opponents of Nazi Germany, Slavic people - is sometimes presented in a comparative and/or supranational way, it is often presented in comparative terms.
"Total panic" as the White House struggles to find arguments on impeachment
White House officials struggle to figure out how to repel Thursday's renewed impeachment pressures, and one of the interviewers familiar with the situation describes a sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
It seems to heighten "anxiety, uncertainty, and concern" – one White House-affiliated person thus describes the mood in the Western Wing – that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously harm the president and those around him.
The person stated, "There is not much certainty that there is nothing hidden there."
White House officials were still unsure of how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan to act in such a situation, but also because the allegations are serious enough that the standard methods of effectively avoiding controversy used by the president in the past may not work.
Another person familiar with the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as a "state of shock" accompanied by increasing distrust that, with a protracted impeachment investigation, the likelihood of the president responding irresponsibly and becoming "hard to control" increases.
This concern is shared by another interviewer claiming that those around the president are predicting that he will exhibit more "passive" behavior, and the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This causes concern that Trump may present increasingly unpredictable behavior and explode in unexpected ways – this is in the context of an election year of concern both from the point of view of the presidency and the election.
Faced with the biggest threat to date in the presidency, Trump has been circling from attack to defense, again reaching for a strategy he judged effective during Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia.
He tried to downplay his own request to the Ukrainian president for help in investigating his political rivals, to distract and direct her to the actions of Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and to discredit the whistleblower as being motivated by party motives.
But while many people in the White House are seasoned in combat after Mueller's investigation, something has changed this time," the advisers and consultants said.
The president, whose hallmark is strength, showed Wednesday's press conference as defeated," one person familiar with the situation said.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them cling to the fact that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the aforementioned controversial phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as is often the case when the president is the subject of attacks, this fact is vividly raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House indicates that the results of the presidential support polls are sky-high, and impeachment will not affect the acquisition of new sympathizers much.
"There is no positive in the need to focus on the president's impeachment in the next four months," especially if it hampers his legislative agenda and predominates in a new series of news headlines.
Another interviewer claims that those who maintained that impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worried White House officials sought help from advisers, completing an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear whether any command center-style initiative will be taken and what form it may take.
The person stated that there was a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a strong leader able to carry out a PR attack reproducible to the publication of a virulent whistleblower report and intended to stop the democrats' momentum over the impeachment given by the disclosure of that report.
The interviewer familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they had no intention of disclosing a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
It is now predicted that the pressure will be greater than in the course of Robert Mueller's investigation, who mostly remained silent and spoke only through accusations. One person who may be involved in developing a response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, Trump's dirty-doing man and former chief of the electoral staff, the person involved in the case stated.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will direct this action.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I could to support the president and his program," he said, "but I have not been involved in any talks with the president or his team about joining the team to repel a false narrative about impeachment."
Donald Trump's private attorney from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
"We're responding to things right," Sekulow responded when asked by NBC News to comment.
Currently, the White House is feeling the lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current adviser, Pat Cipollone, does not have this type of experience.
An interviewer familiar with the White House's strategy stated that, in general, officials did not plan at any time to engage people or create a command center, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, collaborative response and a person who could lead the political struggle.
Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas has been overhauled for 89 million pounds
The Explorer of the Seas, part of the Royal Caribbean International family, will embark on a cruise this summer, presenting an entirely new look.
After the renewal, which has claimed an impressive $110 million ($89 million), the ship delights with a wide selection of culinary delights from around the world and a rich entertainment offering for the whole family.
This summer, Explorer will stop at the finest ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to experience the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
As the adventure on land comes to an end, the crew of the ship promises an unforgettable experience at sea.
With an offer to satisfy everyone, the Explorer, after a $110 million renovation, or about $89 million, has transformed into a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the whole family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surf simulators or watch their favorite family movie, taking advantage of the weather, as part of an outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that allow interior cabin passengers to enjoy ocean views without having to go on board.
Water lovers will be delighted by the newly designed poolside deck combining the style of a Caribbean resort with the charms of a water park.
The pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and sun loungers ideal for sunbathing, and two modernized slides are within reach of those thirsty for a strong onboard experience.
A tour guide attractive to passengers of all ages impresses with the number of activities available to guests during the journey to their destinations.
Created for toddlers, the Adventure Ocean for Kids is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and the upscale place for teenagers to spend their free time offers super games and a music zone prepared for people over the age of 12.
If this turns out to be insufficient, the whole family can in the "studio B" on the ship face off in a laser tag game with the effect of shining in the dark, which in an impressive way can also serve as an ice skating rink.
During the cruise on the Mediterranean Sea, guests will also have the opportunity to experience exotic flavors from around the world, going on to conquer the restaurants on board.
Modernized Asian cuisine is offered on board at the Izumi restaurant, and the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen serves fine food inspired by its innovative take on traditional Italian cuisine.
Other food outlets on board include the American restaurant serving Chops Grille steaks, the Boleros Latin Bar, the Schooner Bar, and the Johnny Rockets Express Bar.
The cruise, with the option of a seven- or nine-day tour, departs from Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship to be part of the Royal Caribbean line, she will join the Allure of the Seas, which also recently underwent an incredible overhaul.
After a 58-day Allure metamorphosis, costing a total of $165 million, the cruise operator offered guests who had previously made a reservation a $300 voucher to spend on board the ship.
The cruise operator stated, "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager-class ship to undergo a transformation as part of the Royal Amplified fleet upgrade."
The program, which requires an investment of more than $1 billion, covering 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unique attractions and dining experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding "nude pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of the State of California apparently cannot stand the naked truth that there is an investigation going on about President Donald Trump.
In his Thursday defense of the president, he accused Democrats of wanting to receive nude photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican sitting on the House Intelligence Committee, made the above allegation during a preliminary statement during a hearing following a whistleblower complaint that Trump was asking Ukraine to help launch an investigation against Democratic candidate for president Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque portrayal" of the left and their "media ace" before stating that Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in a negligee.
"Democrats on this committee were negotiating with people who they thought were Ukrainians to receive naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the president on trial when they have their chance in a year's time.
When Nunes finished giving the reprimand, HuffPost political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to... uncover it.
To date, only Connecticut representative Jim Himes has responded, although we suspect that his answer is a naked truth, a confirmation of the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' comments about nudity referred to "some more lascivious and unconfirmed information" that is likely to appear in Steele's controversial files,
This is a notorious collection of charges against Trump collected by former British spy Christopher Steele, indicating the likelihood of a tape showing him watching a urinating prostitute in a Moscow hotel room.
Potential research on renewable biofuels may help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated news sites in recent years, one issue seems to elude renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Department of Agriculture, Life Sciences and the Environment who began working on this project in 2003.
His laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fatty wastes such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than oil fuels, as well as using waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is designed to mimic hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," Bressler said, "is [produce] hydrocarbons that are identical molecules to diesel."
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuel, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilize at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat for high-altitude aircraft.
"The aviation fuel problem is a bit of a vicious circle," Bressler said.
It is actually worth less than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking into two options for producing aviation biofuel.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on the partially developed chemical properties that will provide stability to the fuel, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
A splinter company formed by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to commercialize the product as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, are increasing investment in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine times when a reversal of the situation may occur and a carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will constitute a contingency plan.
Forge currently runs a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support the $25 million construction of a manufacturing facility that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce approximately 19 million litres of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the projected reduction in coal will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transportation and fuel production are holding back further reductions in coal.
"As a technology specialist," Bressler said,
I am tasked with developing options that enable informed decisions and many choices."
CASTLE: Another Granddaughter Fraud
8,000 zlotys and 750 euros lost Zamość's resident thinking that she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
Police were informed of the incident on Thursday by the son of a cheated Zamość woman.
"A woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused the accident and needed the money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
The senior woman, wanting to help her grandson, donated 8 thousand zlotys and 750 euros to a false policeman who came to her house," reports Dorota Krukowska-Bubilo from the Zamość police.
Police officers are looking for the perpetrator and once again call for caution:
"Every call for financial assistance needs to be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotions and in a hurry.
Remember, cops don't ask for money and they don't take money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling 911.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the dangers, let's tell them how scammers work.
Let's be careful and not trust the people who call and ask for a loan."

One of the cabinet's chief ministers said last night that the country was facing a "violent social spree" if the original result was challenged by the outcome of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's allies in his immediate entourage warned that the country was threatened with social unrest on the scale of the "yellow vest" protests in France due to social inequality and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson called for "calm moods" during a tumultuous argument about the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "surrender".
Despite his call for calm, the cabinet minister told The Times: "There have never been such protests in this country as the 'gilets jaunes' ("yellow vests") demonstrations or the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
People think it's impossible, just because it hasn't happened before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – they use encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate pickets, and to push people to protest, it takes a few unkind populist leaders.
The Los Angeles riots erupted after a jury acquitted four white police officers who beat up black cab driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests – the jaunes guillet – have been emptying and vandalizing the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister referred to Johnson's warning in the House of Commons and said that if Britain fails to exit the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we hold a referendum in which 30 million people vote and 66% of them vote to remain in the European Union, ten million people will remain dissatisfied," he said.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their MP and who will not let go.
It doesn't take much to see tens of thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the chief cabinet ministers added that the country is in danger of "violent social outburst" if the result of the first referendum is challenged by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would decide the fate of Brexit.
According to reports, the Prime Minister faces the risk of a cabinet rebellion wanting to lower demands on Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU instead.
Holownia, Czubówna and Krosny were delighted in Kraków.
Behind Us Talk'N"Roll
Over 300 participants listened on Thursday (26 September) to 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
All this as part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Kraków for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Broadening horizons, talking about ideas worth noting, and discussing together, which can become an impulse for further development.
This was the goal set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers to the stage, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, including people known from the media - Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The theme of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and it was around creating the future that the speeches of guests invited to participate in the conference were focused.
The first session was opened by the managing director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about how the brand that is built around itself can affect our future.
Richard Lucas went onstage to change the audience's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if the future is to be created, while Chris Badura took up the subject of empathy in an era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help you manage your career and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right work-life balance.
The second part of the conference was opened by a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, who talked about, among other things, how the teaching profession in Poland has changed from her perspective over the years.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that – thanks to the development of technology – today everyone can pursue this profession.
However, he does not think that in the next few years a person in the position of a lector will be completely replaced by technology.
Just after it, Piotr Nabielec took up the problem of life in times of information overload, emotional overload or overload in the matter of choice, giving the audience valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
Playing teaches, teaching plays
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions by inviting the illusionist, Daniel Jedynak, to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first entertained the audience with a pantonym, and then – on the example of his own career – talked about how he tries to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and his private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Szymon Hołownia with his speech, emphasizing above all the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can radically change the situation and you have to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Hołownia shared his thoughts on the reality around us, recalling anecdotes that may have brought a smile to the viewers' faces.
Then Adrian Tworuszka appeared on the stage, who reviewed the history and goals of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end, Marcin Słowiak, on the example of Rubik's Cube, talked about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly contributed something new to the perception of the reality of everyone who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to a great commitment from the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for everyone who personally could not participate in the event, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of rule of law.
"Despite not having enough votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has made a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of tri-division of power," the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights wrote in a report published Thursday.
The report "Government of the law instead of the rule of law" documents, among other things, changes in the justice system and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) released a report on Thursday entitled "Government of the law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation assesses in its report that between 2015 and 2019, the largest regression in the field of human rights protection in Poland after 1989 was recorded.
"Despite not having enough votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has made a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of tri-division of power.
By aligning the law with political goals, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," write HFPC experts.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the judiciary, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the area of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
"Over the past four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to pursue particular party interests.
This translated into the ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as weakening the entire human rights protection system in Poland," emphasized attorney Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years have been "a period of systemic change in both the state and human rights protection."
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 pieces of legislation crucial from the point of view of human rights protection.
"Changes were often accepted at a hasty pace, without public consultation and despite objections from the legal community, the Ombudsman or international organizations," explained lawyer Małgorzata Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed in the past four years are: "weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), failure to respect binding court judgments and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening of guarantees of human rights protection".
The state authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered "those situations in which the state authorities did not react or directly disregard the emerging cases of aggression".
Foundation experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the state's activity in the field of limiting the rule of law is an ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from entities of international law.
"The failure to implement these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to liability for violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," the report said.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life sentence for honor killing
Women's rights experts say that it is often difficult to pursue justice because of protracted proceedings, the release of suspected bail killers, and the blurring of cases in the public eye.
"It's taking so long for people to forget," says Farzana Bari, a women's rights advocate and founder of Pakistan's first gender studies department at the university, and adds that even the widely publicized Baloch murder case has been settled for more than three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to determine according to women's rights groups, Pakistan's Human Rights Commission in 2018 found at least 300 cases of so-called honor killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and a network promoting awareness of honor crimes estimates that Pakistan accounts for about one-fifth of the 5,000 honor killings committed every year worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, remittances to the country are decreasing, because many emigrants settle outside Poland permanently – reports Friday's "Rzeczpospolita".
According to the latest Euro-Tax report, the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to over PLN 8.6 thousand in 2018, which means that they increased by almost a thousand zlotys, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish economic emigrants in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one-seventh more than the year before", it reads.
The director of the Migration Research Center at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poles are doing better on the international labour market, where they use various available options.
"There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who, in search of ever better conditions, move from country to country, as do employees of multinational corporations," the newspaper reported.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, e.g. the UK and Germany.
"It was in Germany in 2018 that the combined earnings of Polish expatriates (up to nearly PLN 27 billion) increased the most, as by 11%.
However, the Poles in the Islands made the most money anyway – almost PLN 35 billion", we read further.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of wage emigrants is not decreasing.
The Saxons in the West and North of Europe (led by Norway) are often a chance for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
"And this even at the minimum rates in a given country, which e.g. in Germany is 9.5-11.7 euros per hour," the journal reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" reports that Poles stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles grow roots abroad, which can also be seen from the decreasing remittances to the country.
Last year's was the lowest in years.
As economist Tadeusz Chrościcki recalls, as the period of stay abroad is extended, the group of people transferring money to the country decreases and their amount decreases.
"Emigrants bring their loved ones to each other," reads the Friday edition of Rzeczpospolita.
Prolonged monsoons cause flooding and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has already been extended by almost a month, and unprecedented rainfall causes death due to the sliding of buildings and the rotting of many crops.
Normally in northern India, monsoon subsides in early September, however, the average rainfall this month has exceeded the norm by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon in decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unheard of – recently in the western Indian city of Pune Wednesday and Thursday heavy rains have resulted in the deaths of a dozen people and the devastation caused by the collapse of buildings.
There was a flood of houses, people walked through the streets in the water to their knees, which normally only happens during the monsoon apogee.
Heavy rainfall has also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
Due to prolonged rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many homes were destroyed.
Monsoon also started with a delay.
Water was scarce in many areas, so farmers were preparing for probable drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
"Through him, my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of a delayed as well as late-ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, which is an indispensable component of Indian dishes.
The onion, which usually had to be paid 20 rupees (0.23 British pounds), now costs 80 rupees (about 1 British pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival is the October 8 Dasara festival, during which Hindus erect huge cuckoos like from a comic book, depicting Ravana, a character with a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the epic "Ramajana".
The burning of Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's likenesses were made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana will be the last to laugh.

Doodle celebrates Google's 21st birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we look for answers to all the questions that torment us.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How much?" are some of the favorite categories searched by Poles.
According to the data of the giant, last year we were happy to ask, among others, about "Where is the storm?", "How to make asparagus?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How to get rid of fruit flies?", "How to eat kaki?".
Today, the search engine celebrates its twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and in Poland as many as 96% of people use "uncle Google" – are welcomed today by a special Google Doodle.
This time it's not animated.
Google recalls its birthday by showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the lower right corner a digital date was printed – as in a 1990s photo.
Cataloging information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was supposed to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Its name is a pun.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning the number ten raised to the power of the hundredth.
The name was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as many pages from the world's Internet resources as possible.
Google Search was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the usual methods of sorting results based on the frequency of occurrence of a given phrase.
In the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which denotes the number of pages linking to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon thereafter launched the now famous google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, PC Magazine reported the extremely high relevance of Google search results.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, conquering more markets and increasing the value of the company.
As early as June 2000, Google's URL index has more than a billion entries, making Page and Brin's work the largest search engine in the world.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So is there any further room for development?
"The mission of Google is to organize the world's information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made great progress in this area, we still have a very long way to go to achieve this goal," Piotr Zalewski of Google Poland assured in an interview with "Newsweek".
Frequent exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to high concentrations of plant protection products can translate into a high risk of heart disease later in life.
This was the case with a group of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii who had been studied for over 30 years.
The researchers found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the most contact with them were 45% more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
"This study highlights the need to use personal protective equipment for the duration of exposure to pesticides at work and the importance of record keeping in medical records of exposure to such agents at work, as well as controlling standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease," said study co-author Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results were based on data from more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu cardiology program.
As the researchers pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so the effects of their effects on health can be felt many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez said: "After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant."
This was probably because aging factors became more important, which masked the possible cause and effect relationship between exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease incidence in later years of life.
The researchers did not find a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelensky-Trump phone call: Poroshenko throws in his three cents
Washington's policy has been tumultuous for a week in connection with the initiation of an impeachment procedure against U.S. President Donald Trump.
Getting involved in a political scandal is a situation for the political debutant Volodymyr Zelensky, which he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelensky-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching effects on the former?
Almost at the start of the phone conversation, Trump told Zelensky that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes released by the White House are not complete, they detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader, along with other leaders of European countries, engages in negotiations instead of making specific proposals.
The controversy was sparked by Zelensky's response, which stated that he agrees with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelensky added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of opinions made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decide to speak through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the support provided by the EU "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU's support given during the "Russian aggression" which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska stated: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?".
Trump then mentioned military aid and asked Zelensky to investigate not one, but two cases: the one involving Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other relating to the hacking of the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on Democrats' email boxes during the 2016 election.
It is not known whether this will spoil European relations, or make the relationship with the leader of France and Germany break.
I don't want to speak ill of anyone...
We thank all those who help us," he said after publishing a transcript of Zelensky's phone call in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelensky is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the "Normandy Four", which is scheduled to take place in October.
Former provincial inspector legally acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of the alleged acts.
After 6 years Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, the former head of the Provincial Inspectorate of Agricultural and Food Quality in Rzeszów, on charges of exceeding his rights.
The Lublin prosecutor's office alleged that he was supposed to tell the then marshal of the province the date of the inspection in the food oil production plant.
A final acquittal has recently been handed down in this case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12.
"The court upheld the acquittal verdict," confirmed Judge Małgorzata Reizer, a spokesman for the District Court in Przemyśl.
It is about the judgment of 14 February this year issued by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on Facebook at the time: "It has been six years since the Prosecutor's Office in Lublin presented me with an allegation of a violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship on 30 April 2012.
The court stated unequivocally that I was innocent and did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship at that time was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of events made public by the media outlined in 2013 by the Prosecutor's Office of Appeal in Lublin was not true and caused irreparable damage to both the entrepreneur of the food producer as well as the loss of the image of me in my employers, among employees and in the local community.
The indictment that was made against me in the opinion of the Court contained a number of errors, false facts, unreliable determinations of legal grounds, not confirmed in actual events.
With the help of the CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately fired from my job and deprived of my financial resources.
I stayed for a long time to support my spouse."
Recall.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the provincial inspector of the commercial quality of agri-food products from 2009 to 2013.
He was recalled from his post after the prosecutor's office in Lublin presented him with charges in 2013.
According to investigators, he was supposed to tell the then provincial marshal (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the term of control in a food oil production plant owned by the wife of the then deputy marshal of Podkarpackie.
This warning – as prosecutors from Lublin claimed – was to cause the owner of the company to know about the control and correct the labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of exceeding his powers, for which he was threatened with up to 3 years imprisonment.
"I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I did nothing wrong, which is now confirmed by a final verdict acquitting me of the charges I was charged with," comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide the record of the conversation with Zelensky
In an edited report released Thursday, the whistleblower wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, sought foreign state interference in the U.S. elections, and the White House sought to hide the record of the conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12, the whistleblower, who is probably an intelligence employee, wrote: "As part of my official duties, I have been informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his function to demand foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. elections."
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelensky) to pursue his own interests.
Specifically, he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president re-election in 2020," the report said.
Ukrainian leaders were "made to understand" that contacts with Trump depend on whether he "exercises the will to take up the game" on matters more specifically reported to him by President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer.
The author admits that he did not witness the conversation, but points out that he was informed in detail about its content by "many White House officials who had direct information about it" and their accounts overlapped.
"In the days following this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that high-ranking White House officials intervened to 'flomb' all archival records relating to this conversation, and especially the literal record that was made, as is usually done, in the White House crisis room," the statement continued.
"High-ranking White House officials have told me that White House lawyers have 'ordered' them to remove the electronic record from the IT system where such records are stored.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," wrote the author of the report.
"In my assessment, these steps demonstrate that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the whistleblower said.
As the AP agency comments, this document will likely speed up the investigation into the president's possible impeachment, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can corroborate the account.
The recording of the conversation with the Zelensky White House, after pressure from Congress, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of electronic recording, but on the basis of the accounts of people who witnessed it.
The contents of the report, as edited, were revealed a day later by the House Intelligence Committee.
Also on Thursday, Acting Director of U.S. Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee and provided explanations on how he treated the intelligence officer's report.
Maguire said the whistleblower made the right choice and acted as the law requires.
He also stressed that in his opinion the matter of talking with Zelensky is an "unprecedented" event.
Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he had blocked the release of the whistleblower report to Congress; the director of intelligence replied that he had no authority to disclose its contents, the confidential nature of which guarantees the so-called executive privilege.
Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi reported that on suspicion that the president was pressuring the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she assessed that the transcript of Trump's conversation with Zelensky confirms that the U.S. president had violated election and security norms.
U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said there was "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and the report "there is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts and glued together press clippings."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and false narrative propagated by mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The safety prize was awarded in recognition that Ghana has achieved Africa's highest number of aviation safety oversight points, i.e. 89.89 percent of the temporary rate of Effective Implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM audit on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency's Universal Security Oversight Audit Program.
The award in the field of security was a recognition of the country's high commitment to implementing ICAO-recommended standards and protocols for security at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The awards program was developed to provide support for an ICAO initiative called No Country Left Behind.
In addition, the ICAO Member States, which have improved their safety and security standards, have been awarded 16 other safety certificates and 17 in the field of security.
The Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa were present at the awards ceremony for Ghana.
In his speech, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, stressed the need for Member States to maintain safety in the aviation space.
He said, "It is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in an era of innovation, aviation security and sustainability must remain our primary priorities."
For his part, Mr. Adda noted that the awards were a tremendous achievement for the efforts of the state, as they are a compliment to the hard work and perseverance of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has great potential for the development of the country's economy, saying "the aviation industry has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection we have achieved."
CASTLE: Tanked and ran, he also stole a bike
The 50-year-old from Zamość municipality drove his audi to the distributor, refueled and drove away without paying.
In this way, he robbed gas stations several times.
A man also stole a bicycle from one of the Zamość offices a month ago.
The owners of petrol stations valued the losses at almost PLN 1,000.
The owner of the stolen bike – PLN 2,000.
Last Tuesday, one of the Zamość districts noticed on Wyszyńskiego audi street, whose owner was suspected of theft.
A wanted 50-year-old was just behind the wheel.
The man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday, he was charged with stealing fuel from four gas stations and a bicycle.
He pleaded guilty to these crimes.
Uniforms also found a stolen bike.
The one-track will soon return to the owner.
For theft, the thief faces a prison sentence of up to 5 years.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testifies at a meeting of the Senate National Security Budget Subcommittee on FEMA's 2020 budget proposal at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The White House said in a statement Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, who is FEMA's deputy administrator, serves as the agency's chief executive overseeing the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has operated without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March, when Brock Long fired the position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to which FEMA is subject, stated that Long had improperly used government vehicles to drive between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for the position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough background check revealed allegations that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination for the position was expected.
A majority in the Senate will be required to approve his nomination for the role.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considers finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized over a distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the runner-up of Europe at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the 2016 games, but the pains had returned and had intensified greatly in the current season.
Pain makes me put my foot in a different way, which in turn changes the layout of my body, there are other unnatural loads and I start to feel pains in other places, for example in my hip.
Because of this, I could not prepare enough for the world championship, and for two weeks the pain has been so severe that I have difficulty putting on spikes," said the runner on the air of the NRK television channel.
Gjert Ingebrigtsen's father and coach admitted that after much discussion with his son, they concluded that the only solution to not end his career and participate in next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only, although drastic solution and the decision has already actually been made.
"If a part of the body hurts, then it is necessary to get rid of it, and all in all Henrik does not need this finger so much and in this situation it is necessary to forget about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police shut down illegal e-cigarette factory with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, police closed an illegal marijuana e-cigarette factory in the San Gabriel Valley.
An office building on 9600 Telstar Avenue was raided at around 4:37 p.m., during which police searched for illegal marijuana-containing e-cigarettes and during which large jars containing butane hash oil were found – cannabis concentrate.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of El Monte Police, the officers also found a device that was used to refill the vaping cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," Cano says.
Cano, who once worked on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The usual electrostatic spark from our clothes can ignite these fumes, causing not only fire, but because of concentration, even and explosion," he says.
"If we have many jars and the like in the room, one explosion will follow, causing not only a fire, but an explosion that could wipe the entire complex off the surface.
A team was called to the office building for special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant, so illegal activity was detected.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up a business in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to make sure that illegal products have not hit the street, given recent emerging articles about the harm of vaping.
"People don't really know what products they're buying," Cano says.
"They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This can be a threat to our community and children, which is why we always warn them against reaching for this type of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from trading.
GIF has made a decision on a thrush drug
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate reported on the withdrawal from the market of a drug for oral infections.
Aphtin is a drug that is used to treat thrush and yeast infections of the oral mucosa, infections with Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to a non-conforming smell of the product and a decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Each month, GIF issues on average several decisions to withdraw individual series of products from the market.
Series of the drug discontinued in Poland can, after presenting evidence of its safety, be re-introduced to the market.
If the drug is withdrawn, this is not possible.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collector's note about this denomination?
It bears a face value of 19 zlotys and bears the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collector's banknote will be put into circulation, the National Bank of Poland reported.
This is another note in the "Independence" series.
It is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Securities Printing Works.
As stated in the NBP communiqué, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the note.
The date on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW is celebrated.
Also, the nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of establishment of the Wytwórnia" - reads in the NBP release.
The watermark depicts the image of an eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
A novelty is the holographic stripe located on the pane in the substrate.
The front side presents a portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription "independent" a stylized image of the Order of the White Eagle was presented.
This inscription, mapped from Józef Piłsudski's manuscript, is a logotype of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Poland's regaining independence.
A branch of the laurel, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, was incorporated into the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angular effect.
On the reverse side of the banknote there is an image of the Wytwórnia building against the background of the panorama of contemporary Warsaw.
Next to it is the SPARK Live protection built into the PWPW logo and an iridescent stripe, also visible in UV light in the form of repeated numbers "19" and the abbreviation "NBP" - describes the NBP.
The banknote is scheduled to go into circulation on October 2nd with a circulation of up to 55,000 units.
One bill will cost $80.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from special series, are legal tender in Poland.
Their nominal value, however, far exceeds that which can be achieved in the collector's market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, or over two million, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded onto a barge.
From there he crossed the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński to vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska in the upcoming elections.
"I ask the same thing," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński together with Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for a photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" boasted on social media that she would gain Kaczynski's voice in the parliamentary elections.
"President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska", reads on her Facebook profile.
The head of the party indicated that he was a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to help.
"I will cast my vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska and ask for the same thing," he appeals.
Gosiewska is running for the Sejm from district 19 (Warsaw) and from third place on the list.
"The only one" is Kaczynski himself, and the second place is taken by Mariusz Kamiński.
The Christmas Book Fair is coming.
Meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices are ahead of us.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podkarpacie are said not to read books.
We will show that it is different," said Marta Półtorak during a press conference.
And who will support reading in Rzeszów this year?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia, hailed as the first cook of the Republic of Poland, will appear at the fair, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Swiek.
This fall, a great cultural event will take place in Millenium Hall – on 22 and 23 November, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region, will come to the shopping centre.
The most interesting publishing and accounting offices from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be as many as 30 of them, and among them will include Agora, Znak, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their extensive publishing offers and hundreds of book novelties, which the participants of the fair will be able to buy at attractive prices.
What's more, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, authors were invited who write about important issues and are not afraid to take up difficult topics, and in addition, they are winners of prestigious awards and... they cook great.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, participation in the fair was confirmed by, among others, Łukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the policy passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, who is the author of the best-selling "Loneliness on the Web", and the queen of the Polish crime fiction: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be Sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cookbooks), which have sold over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of Elizabeth I's lost dress at Hampton Court Palace
Interspersed with silver thread, the gown made of the finest silk chamlot was elaborately decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation exhibition, this meant only one thing.
The faded cloth hanging for 100 years on the wall of the tiny rural parish church she was looking at could only have been a lost part of Elizabeth I's dressing room.
Three years after Lynn stumbled across a sumptuous altar cloth in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's missing gown is due next month for an exhibition at Hampton Court Palace, close to the same rooms where the Tudor queen could wear it more than 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that of the entire collection of royal gowns, only one more element of the 16th-century gown survives.
While there is no conclusive evidence that Elizabeth would ever wear this dress, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
The "swords", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bear, indicates that the dress belonged to the most prominent of the people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, may have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women at court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fine fabrics," Lynn claims.
"As this is a very important statement, I've asked a lot of people from the environment to look at the dress.
I really enjoyed seeing the dress, too, and they were practically convinced that we had an element of royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long, re-life of the dress, trimmed to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry came, Elizabeth's closest lady of the court, who served the queen her entire long life and with whom the cloth in question was identified in local legends.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or parish in memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of restoration work, four hundred of which passed on the most delicate hand sewing using specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar cloth will go to the exhibition next to the Hatfield House palace's temporary rental portrait of "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous paintings of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar gown.
"When working with historical fabrics, the craftsmanship of the people who made them is really beginning to be respected," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in a converted greenhouse at Hampton Court Palace – the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapestries.
"Looking at the embroidery from the front and back, I started to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elitist.
An exhibition entitled "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will begin at Hampton Court Palace on October 12.
Fitch Agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable outlook
Fitch Agency confirmed on Friday Poland's long-term rating in foreign currency at the level of "A-", the statement said.
The rating outlook remained stable.
"The Fitch agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-diversified economy, which is supported by a reasonably conducted economic policy and a strong banking sector," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the business cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.
The agency forecasts that the level of the general government deficit to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below the 3 percent limit, respectively 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent.
"The debt ratio of the government and local government sector to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent, according to the agency, and in the following years it will be smaller (48.3 percent on average in the 2020-2021 period)," the report said.
Polish Rating
The autumn round of reviews of Poland's rating on 11 October will be completed by S&P and Moody's.
According to Fitch agency, Poland's rating remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the "A-" level with a stable outlook.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's creditworthiness is highest rated by Moody's – at the "A2" level.
The rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The outlook for all assessments is stable.
What is a rating?
Rating agencies are created to help investors assess the risk scale of their investment activities.
The rating is given to companies, banks and states.
In the case of the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
A rating is nothing more than a credit rating.
On its basis, decisions are made about who and for how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests who is best not to grant any loans at all, because there is a considerable risk that the money will not be recovered.
A lower rating carries a higher risk.
In turn, the higher risk is high interest on the loan.
Each assessment must be reasoned and reasoned.
Ratings can be manipulated, but in this case, agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global rating services market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each uses its own rating system.
"Fifth of Confederation": First 1000 plus
The "Fifth Confederation", or the main assumptions of the electoral program, was presented on Friday in Koszalin by candidates for the Sejm from district 40 applying for a mandate from the list of the KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Koszalin letter to the Sejm, Krzysztof Chmielewski, presented the slogans of the "Fifth Confederation".
"First of all, the 1000 plus program for Poland, secondly fast and fair courts, thirdly cultural voucher and educational voucher, fourthly national security, fifthly it is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He pointed out that "Poles must finally start making decent money", which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and – as Chmielewski said – "the problem with the tax-free amount will solve itself".
"Poles need to be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all", the leader of the list said about the assumptions of the "1000 plus program for Poland".
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadecka, running from the second place of the list, referring to the programmatic slogan "healthy life" said that "food is of increasingly poor quality" and to change this, one should "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", act for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy is also in favour of stopping the "stigmatization of hemp".
Zadnicka declared the Confederation's support for the "development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also spoke out on behalf of her group for "voluntary vaccinations".
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
Subsequent candidates to the Sejm from the Koszalin district emphasized that the Confederation was in favor of "conducting a deep reform of the judiciary", the element of which would be, among other things, the consideration of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also advocated that the educational subsidy should go to schools without local government mediation, i.e. – according to them – without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederacy is also behind a "strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
Candidates for the Sejm emphasized the need to increase the size of the army.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "constant access to energy".
"We can gasify coal, we have large deposits of geothermal energy, we also need to consider a return to the idea of a nuclear power plant," said Piotr Karpiński, fifth on the electoral list.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind a third of the drugs in the US
Chicago – Just after sunrise on the West Side of Chicago, CBS News reported on the morning pursuit of drugs.
Brian McKnight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has shown in full light what's going on.
Last year, nearly 800 people died from a drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight claimed "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord, Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"It is he who is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for federal executive bodies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's chief agent in Mexico.
The El Mencho prize is $10 million.
He helped uncover dozens of El Mencho drug labs located in the jungle.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one-third of drugs reaching the U.S. by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled "tonnes" of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho has a $10 million reward for his head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he formed the brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.
It basically has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho protects his empire with impunity, using measures such as shooting down a helicopter of the Mexican army, killing six people, or participating in a public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the cartel's brutality has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab, a packet of cocaine is labeled a smuggler's brand.
For more than a third of them, the tracks lead to the El Mencho Cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when someone else's child dies, according to Donahue, there is a "big chance" that the drugs came from the El Mencho organization.
More than 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed French president and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the First Lady, the French prosecutor's office said.
The defendant assures that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He demanded from the head of state, among others, 300,000 euros in cash.
The man, who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police force, claims to have received "explosive" documents from a person employed at the Elysian Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but revealing them in their entirety could even jeopardize the safety of Macron and the First Lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded 300,000 euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from a previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would hand them over to the media – but it is not yet known if these documents really exist.
They were not found at the time of the search at the 27-year-old's apartment.
The man underwent psychiatric tests, but doctors did not find him to have any serious disorders.
PS4 game will be old-school – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the upcoming PS4-only game The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony announced in a recent State of Play presentation that the sequel, The Last of Us, will premiere in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
Even more specifics were revealed in the days after the loud premiere of the gameplay fragment of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony, along with Naughty Dog, are reaching for old-school climates in many ways.
It's decided on something we haven't seen much since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several discs.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a sensational interview given to The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The plot is ambitious and intricate in aspects where the one wasn't," he said.
It had to be so extensive as to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to make the most extensive game, it just happened.
"We're excited to know how many possibilities there are in this story, and there will be times when you think you're heading towards the end, but you'll realize that this is just the beginning and that a whole new chapter is starting," Druckmann continues.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two discs.
Elsewhere, it has been revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two Easter Eggs with adult content (information provided by Gamestpot).
We will not spoil the surprise, but the Easter Eggs appearing in the game refer to the old-school works of Naughty Dog.
You'll find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two launches on February 21, 2020 exclusively on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available on the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to pre-order for the sequel, Sony has announced that there will be multiple versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelet, and a 30-centimeter figurine of this iconic character.
Run, jerk and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the first-timer Stomil will take up Podbeskida and is in the mood for victory.
Stomil players from three rounds are undefeated.
Piotr Zajączkowski's subordinates scored seven points at that time, because they won against Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match a goalless draw in Suwałki fell.
Now the Olsztyn team will take up Podbeskid at 6 p.m. on Saturday, which is listed as one of the favourites for promotion to the Ekstraklasa.
Stomil's closest rivals take fourth place in the table and have an advantage point over the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskid on trips this season played six times and scored two wins, draws and defeats whereas Stomil feels very well at his facility – in the stadium at 69a Piłsudski Avenue, Piotr Zajączkowski's team won three times and lost once.
A total of 17 points were accumulated by the Olsztynians in ten queues and they are in the top of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the competition nothing foreshadowed it.
"Every change takes time to produce results," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, finally, something has gone wrong with us, we have believed in ourselves, and we can work under normal conditions.
We just focused on the ball game.
There are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil players eliminated the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but needed overtime and a series of penalty kicks.
To the south of Poland did not go Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc, because coach Zajączkowski gave rest to these key players before Saturday's skirmish against Podbeskidzie.
In Chorzów, on the other hand, Jakub Mosakowski returned after an injury, who finally scored his long-awaited goal.
"It's always fun to score a goal, and I hit it at such a point that it allows us to continue playing in cups (Mosakowski leveled at 3:3 in the 119th minute - ed.).
Dad would bite me a lot and laugh that I couldn't get a goal, and I always told him I'd shoot at a point when he wasn't expecting it."
Now Mosakowski is hoping to return to the basic line-up, all the more so because of the yellow cards he cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
"That's why I'm pushing hard in training so I can play in the first lineup," says Mosakowski.
"In Chorzów, I did my best to present myself as best I could.
However, whether I'm going to play or sit on the back bench, I'm going to be just as supportive of the team as I am.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the match against Podbeskidzie.
We certainly have a tough meeting ahead, in which victory will have to be run out, torn out, and fought."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defence, Rafał Remisz may still play, who has recently also suffered an injury, so whether he will perform we will find out only on Saturday, especially since coach Zajączkowski traditionally tries to keep staff matters secret until the end.
A man raped and murdered his niece
"You will never see the light of day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," Justice Kevin K. Allen said, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and despicable that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
5-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple pinpointed the location of the body.
"How could anyone do this to their own niece?" asked Dejay Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You're the worst person humanity has to offer," he told Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our lives will never be the same again," added the devastated woman.
According to Fox News, the 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion at the hearing.
Last month, he admitted that he had kidnapped, sexually abused and murdered a girl.
The man's lawyer stated that his client was raised in an "imperfect family".
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple was aware that he had committed a terrible act and was willing to face punishment.
The man was sentenced to life imprisonment without being able to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will donate nearly $100 million to drought-stricken communities.
The scheme to provide money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for allocating farm allowances will be simplified.
The aid package includes nearly $34 million for a support initiative for drought-stricken communities, so eligible farms can receive up to $3,000 in emergencies.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the drought relief program will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure subsidies and disaster relief.
The new support package is an addition to more than $7 billion allocated by the government to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
Documentary: In China, divorce rates have doubled in the last decade.
The cause of this was generally third parties.
More and more men are maintaining extramarital relationships, which has caused a particular industry to develop in this country – a professional slayer of lovers who are tasked with saving the marriages of cheating wives.
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-usz!
Attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in Piekary Śląskie
A separate general rehearsal was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekary Śląskie.
"Honorable State, louder, louder, this way we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-usz!", the leader urged strongly.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic chieftain did not bring the expected result.
Election campaign in progress.
Politicians drive all over the country, persuading voters.
The intensive campaign is also led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who as a leader of the Silesian PiS list is a frequent guest in the region.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including the appropriate setting.
That was the case, or rather – it was supposed to be, in Piekary Śląskie.
It is known – a special guest should be specially welcomed.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, the present in the hall decided to conduct a general rehearsal.
Like a dry chief, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a greeting for me, but for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder, my friends!" he encouraged enthusiastically.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not fully taken by the hot prompts of the host and reluctantly replied "Ma-te-us", however, the recording of an enthusiastic chieftain makes a big deal on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to authorities, he entered the Stays' home on July 9, 2014, demanding that his wife, Melannie Haskell, be revealed where he was separated from.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one family member survived, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
Authorities said she was badly injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the grounds of insanity.
The jury will reconvene on Monday to deliver a verdict.
The quantum internet is getting closer to reality – ScienceDaily
U.S. Army research results take the quantum internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and timekeeping accuracy unavailable with the traditional networking approach.
The Center for Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of Combat Capabilities of the U.S. Army looked at researchers from the University of Insbruck who managed to achieve a record-breaking transfer of tangled state between matter and light – over a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.
Confusion is the correlation that can arise between quanta such as qubits.
When two qubits are entangled and one qubit is measured, it will affect the measurement made on the other qubit, even if the other qubit is physically away.
"These [50 kilometres] are two orders of magnitude farther than was previously possible and it is a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and lead researcher in the project, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, section Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of physical qubit networks that are entangled with each other despite the large physical distance.
The researchers found that this scattering of the entangled state is essential for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a big step forward in order to achieve a distributed state tangled on a large scale," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-managing a military program to support this research.
The quality of the tangled state at the other end after the fiber optics have passed is also high enough to meet some of the requirements of some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team began the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, the researchers typed a quantum state into the ion, while arousing it to emit a photon in which quantum information was stored.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were entangled.
The challenge is to send the photon through a fiber optic cable.
"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the fiber optics," Lanyon said.
Therefore, his team initially sent a particle of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The wavelength of the photon has been converted to a value optimal from the point of view of long-distance transmission – the current standard telecommunication wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometer fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and particles of light were still entangled even after the wavelength was transformed and the distance traveled.
"The decision to choose calcium means that this result sets a direct path for the formation of a tangled network of atomic clocks over long physical distances, because calcium can be co-trapped with a high-quality qubit 'clock'.
The Army is very much interested in tangled large-scale clock networks due to applications for precise positional determination, precise navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
