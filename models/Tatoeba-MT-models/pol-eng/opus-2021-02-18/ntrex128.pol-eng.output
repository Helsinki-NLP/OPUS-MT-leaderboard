The members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be called muppets
Among some of the members of the National Assembly, there was confusion, which is the result of a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was based on plans to transform the assembly into a Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may be mocked.
One Labour MP expressed concerns about his group, saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means excrement.
A politician from the Plaid Cymru party stated that his group was “dissatisfied” with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to a change of name, but he pointed out that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The assembly committee, which is currently working on a draft law amending the name, took the following position: "Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be theirs".
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the conversion of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to the “Member of the Welsh Parliament”, that is, the WMP in English, although the abbreviation “MWP” was the most popular among the public.
The difficulties in reaching consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, who should present a bill in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules on recalling members and the structure of the comitology system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On the next Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help resolve the dispute with neighbouring Greece over decades, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that their name is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells in St. Martin's Church in New York are silent because of problems affecting churches in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at the moment."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Currently, people are socializing in a different way," he noted.
"Bars have ceased to be a place for regular community meetings."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that "they will be at the starting point sooner or later".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the remaining surrounding temples.
He said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the complete closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes”.
Both churches were built by an assembly of white believers, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Martin joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
At that time, the African - American assembly took over ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by the assembly chaired by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against salesmen from 125th street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The fire of 1939 significantly damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell assembly.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's church, proudly called the new dwarf "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who rang the bells in July, described them in a different way as "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carol in the world served by black music. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
In recent months there have been a number of complicated events involving architects and performers in the church of St. Martin. Some of them were brought to the place by the secular leaders of the church, and some were brought by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a parish body composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that “it wants to pass the costs on to the council”, although the council did not participate in hiring architects and performers sent to the place.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Shark wounded a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California.
Authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old snorkelling in search of lobsters in California, and the incident occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they approached the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he thought the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but soon he realized that the baby was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Upon reaching the site of the incident, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around the clavicle.
“I started screaming to everyone to escape from the water: “There is a shark in the water!”” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The shark species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, the lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
In order to investigate and for security reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's chain of shops plans to expand its business in the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's network throws a glove to stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing to its supermarkets cosmetics departments referring style to department stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion and household products industries, 11 stores belonging to the network will have bigger shelves with cosmetic products. If the initiative is successful next year, the actions will be extended to further points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways of developing the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3 thousand articles. The range will first include goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its portfolio of Boutique make-up products. From now on, most articles will be vegan friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume salesman Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The popularity of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that sales outlets will increasingly resemble commodity houses because the network is trying to fight off discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's put Argos points in hundreds of stores and introduces a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing sales of foodstuffs and increasing the profitability of investments.
The previous attempt to reorganise the departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals resulted in a failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint venture with Boots to try out. However, the cooperation was concluded following a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for £125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all the needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way we shop so far."
Peter Jones "mad" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den TV show, was angry when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items called Truly.
Activities were often compared to Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the successful lifestyle brand and focus on a renewed collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby enraged Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den program.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “mad” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million he would not have time to devote himself to their brand of accessories and household goods Truly.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand. It was also expected to double Holly Willoughby’s property estimated at £11 million.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave the True brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left Great Britain to go to one of his summer homes.
“ Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby, ” reports the source.
She had a future with her and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
The Marlow Warehouse is full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of This Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows to candles to clothing and household goods – and will lead to further delays in market entry.
It could also mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the True brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them as president in March.
The couples spent their vacations together, and Jones included 40% of his share in a television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program at ITV.
A source similar to Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs".
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president was joking about the criticism of the media caused by the remark that some considered to be “an unattainable husband of state” as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denucleation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are lagging behind.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see an “analogical response” from the United States to the early efforts of North Korea to disarm.
Instead, he noted that the United States maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un have brought positive results: they led to the conclusion of missile trials, helped free the hostages and return the other American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to behave after the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," said Trump, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered directly in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of shelter by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition to accelerate international aid efforts.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international personnel will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh Province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, probably affected the number of deaths.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was stationed on the island of Lombok is headed for the relief of the earthquake victims to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure because of religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died and tens of thousands of people lost their homes as a result of fights between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge scores a goal for a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of the Saturday game played at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's 1-0 goal to the disadvantage of his team.
Before shooting at the far goal, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball went high above the penalty field towards the top right corner of the grid.
Then she fell into the gate, flying over Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to get it as forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot” said Sturridge in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I noticed Kanty coming, I took the ball and I fired the shot without even thinking about it."
Chelsea led a 1:0 in the middle of the game at the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in 25 minutes.
Blue's attacker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovačic, and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kovačic quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful play forward in the penalty field back to Gambling.
Gambling overtakes the defenders, and with his left foot he fired a long shot that passed Liverpool's goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli Club in the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832
According to the Indonesian disaster agency on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has increased to 832.
During the conference, a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that as a result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under the rubble. In addition, the earthquake caused a tsunami of 6 meters.
The town of Palu, inhabited by over 380 thousand people, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.

I also refer to all drivers, in particular taxi drivers, whose recorders could record materials useful during the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people claiming to know a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police have informed us that she's in the process of informing the victim's family about the incident.

Cromwell Memorial in front of the British Parliament's last victim in the dispute over "writing history again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Cricket's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “Due to the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell at Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of the English civil wars, the insulting actions were neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, the age before was determined to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the monument shows how this politician felt in the 19th century, and that for many people he is still a figure worth commemorating.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many Cromwells were seen, perhaps more often in the 19th century than they are today, to defend the parliament against external pressures.
An assessment of the accuracy of this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
On the other hand, it is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
In China, a pig has been beaten to death by a farmer
According to local media, there was a deadly attack on a farmer at a market in the southwest of China.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a severed artery near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kuyczou.
A pig farmer is preparing for vaccination in a pigsty on 30 May 2005, Xining City, Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, my cousin found the body of a man and noticed the door open to the nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on its face.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a nearly 250-kilogram pig that killed a farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview for Guiyang Evening News that for the time of gathering evidence by the police, the pig was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, a man’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
There have been cases of pig attacks on humans before, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, about a 300-pound pig nailed a farmer to a tractor, and a man's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, hurricane Rosa is losing its strength moving over cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa blows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern Time it was given category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast, Rosa will be moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean it begins to form rather than heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of humid air northwards to the southwest United States.
On Monday, it will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in the part of the Mexican territory.
In the following days, the humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching snow will cause heavy rain in the South West of the United States.
In some places, rainfall ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, the movement of pollutants and possible rains in desert areas.
Wet tropical air can cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some parts of the Southwest, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, walking in the desert is definitely reborn.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusts of wind and dust displacement.
Approaching than will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which may cause small shipments of pollution and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall so far in the region.
The tropical rains will start approaching Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the west of the United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic region cools down, temperature fluctuations can occur throughout the United States, but in the intertropical zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri State) and Omaha (Nebraska State) and between St. Louis (Missouri State) and Des Moines (Iowa State) these differences are nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
The temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the northern part of the East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach a value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogations
Over 20 million people watched on six television stations on Thursday’s hearing as Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980 ’ s.
Despite the ongoing political stalemate on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly broadcast programs to announce a sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a weekly prosecution investigation.
Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the Senate judicial committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was groping her intoxicated and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional statement, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that Friday’s number of viewers was even higher than the 20,4 million Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
However, figures were not yet available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen tends to find it difficult to measure the number of people in the workplace.
This number is similar to the American Football Cup or the American Academy of Film Awards.
According to reports from Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day hearing.
The second place was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million.
The interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure of Friday's events.
In the morning he was captured by the cameras of CNN and CBS stations after the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the recording he shouts at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN station.
“I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have the strength to face the infirmity of so many women" - he heard from a woman demonstrating.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the committee.
Later, TV stations continued to broadcast events pending the vote to hand over Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, as the minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting Chris Coons and a few other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republicans wouldn't have the votes they needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for his own benefit
In an interview given to Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham (UK), 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to the one presenting Theresa May on the title page, the former Foreign Minister in her government Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU could collect duties on their behalf, calling it “totally ridiculous”.
Shot by Wayde Sims: police arrested Dytheon Simpson as a suspect in the murder of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colors of Louisiana State University (LSU).
According to reports from Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and arrested for murder in the second degree.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS-related WAFB, police officers found these glasses on the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
The police reported after questioning Simpson that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the arresting lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner's office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Police Command thanked the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports at LSU, thanked local law enforcement for his “hardworking and pursuing justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A 198-inch male grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season, he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "disgusted" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is one of the things we are constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre advised the Mexican people not to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre noted numerous bumps and shocks.
The photos published on social media show the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the districts of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1 degree earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the country's capital city.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between protestors supporting the independence of Catalonia and police preventive troops. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme emotion of the referendum on the Secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separation supporters threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust swept the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place later in the day, and they used batons to stop the fighting of the police force.
For several hours, groups supporting independence chanted, "We do not forget, we do not forgive." The opponents of secedia shouted, "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical help in connection with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, tensions have not diminished, and although the Madrid authorities have found them illegal, it is still a cause for celebration for the desire to secession the Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, but the turnout was low due to the widespread boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with the police trying to prevent voting at polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of people who supported the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration of supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician taking part in the protest of separatists, said that there is no hope of Catalan independence anymore.
"Last year we experienced some of the most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck at a point of no choice," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, the parties supporting the Secession of Catalonia have difficulties in continuing their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic recording a police-supporting protest on the phone, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute fuel conflict.
“The situation is becoming more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his willingness to launch next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Candidate in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving into the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested following a multiple hit at a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 a.m. British Time (BST).
Chief of Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point, a crossbow shot could also be fired toward the car.
The Menga Gate ensures the winning of Livingston over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team a victory.
Ever since this season, the Livingston Club has rocked the Rangers, causing Steven Gerrard only a second failure in his 18 games as coach of the club from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's gate turned out to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team under Gerrard's leadership remains this season without a victory at the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the Hearts leader, to whom it loses eight points.
Earlier, as early as Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League.
Livingston extends the series of wins in his division to six games. Coach Holt has not experienced failure since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against indisposed opponents.
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot into the goal light, but failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow missed after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during the solid pieces of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal came down.
After the Rangers gave up the free throw, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Mende, who scored from the middle of the penal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they could not force the hosts to defend themselves and did not cause much trouble to the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos took one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's trial was defended by the Ranger Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the light of the goal from the next permanent fragment judged in favour of Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingston Penitentiary Field, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty shots after Halkett intervened against Glenn Middleton's replacement and one hand-play. In both cases, however, the complaints of the players were rejected.
"Fenomenal" performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played a wonderful game, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their return to the extra class. However, we should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to play.
This match had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense. Menga, however, made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they have great moments under Gerrard's leadership, in the match they did not uphold their standards.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once was it possible to break through the hosts' defenses. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany. The visit aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union have led to disputes.
After the meeting Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks outside its homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered outside the temple was blocked, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's leader's policy and the decision of the German government to adopt politics in the country.
Opponent protests reflect the divisions that the visit of a politician named hero by a part of the Turks living in Germany and considered autocrat by others has sparked.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died from a collision with a car
The biker was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 British time (BST).
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle and paramedics arrived, and despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, there was another fatal accident involving a cyclist on Childers Street (about a mile away from the site of the Saturday accident).
Metropolitan police have reported that officers are working to identify a dead man and report the incident of family members.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were instructed to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: six officers were injured by riots
According to the authorities of the institution, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a men's prison with a higher level of security.
The riots at HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire began on Sunday around 9:30 British time (BST) and continue.
A special unit of Tornado was called to riots with eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant.
The officers on the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
The company’s spokesman said: “Specially trained staff were involved in the HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our establishments. We are convinced that responsible persons will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the plant had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the facility was called to prevent riots in which workers were attacked with billiards balls.
The sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possibly beneficial effects on drought areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona at the beginning of next week, and the remains of Hurricane Rosa are moving through the desert areas of the Southwest, causing a threat of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued a warning on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, on Tuesday Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix, and on Monday afternoon, the rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached the border of the state of Arizona at a distance of 65 km".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm in height. In some areas Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm in height.
In the remaining desert areas of the South West – including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the precipitation is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm and in some areas to 10 cm.
People outside areas at risk of sudden rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa may be relieved because the region has been suffering from drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where there is a drought.
According to Weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona's area is facing severe droughts of the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. Today, it is located at a distance of 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a significant flood risk.
Weather.com reported that "the area from the California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora is expected to fall from 7 to 15 cm in height, although it can reach 25 cm".
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in a tropical storm in the north. On Tuesday, in the early mornings, she will reach the Arizona state border as tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, she will travel to the southern part of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is a very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwest of the state of Sonora and in the southwest of the desert areas of the United States," states the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are forecast to cause life - threatening floods and pollution in the desert and mudslides in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested in an attempted murder case
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, one 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
Officers are requesting contact with all persons who have recordings of the incident.
Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh had “feel evil and anger” from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous behaviour of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had “feel evil and anger” from the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified in front of the congressional assembly, and he strongly and emotionally denied Christina Blasey Ford's accusations, and a woman claimed that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault on her.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "The Americans could see Kavanaugh's brilliance, class and courage."
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of support for one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, an expert in the law on great merits for the community," he said in front of a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not explicitly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the half of the election presidency.
“We are five weeks apart from the most important choices in our lives.
I am not running for office, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting to protect our great candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are practicing a policy of “resistance and obstruction of activity”.
According to CNN station one of the assistants of the important Republican Party policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed – many of them were kidnapped by high waves crashing against the beaches – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival held in the city. At dusk the waves reached up to 6 meters high, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When there was a threat yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to tsunamis," said BNPD spokesman at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, kidnapping cars, logs and houses,” reported Nugroho. He added that before reaching the coastline, the element was moving at a speed of 800 km/h at sea.
As he said, some of them saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city suffered secondary shocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people, a number of earthquakes occurred.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement states that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
Then he added that the bodies of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communication “has been completely paralyzed” and therefore there are no reports from the Donggal province.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” says the Red Cross statement, adding that the workers and volunteers of the organization go to the places affected by the disaster.
“We can talk about tragedy now, although the situation may deteriorate considerably,” says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to a lack of information about the bombing of the Palu tsunami. However, the authorities reported that the waves came shortly after the warning was issued.
On an amateur video made available on social media, you can see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall crashed to the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to confirm the recording's authenticity immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still very much need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was opened only for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is to visit the centers for those evacuated in Palu.
Over 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseb T. Sinay, the national director of World Vision, the staff of the organization arrived safely from the Donggal province to Palu and found shelter in tents made of tarpaulins placed in the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to provide assistance, there has been criticism that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, receiving funding, resources and staff from abroad can only be started after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster,” said the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not yet happened."
After two days of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders participating in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples.
“As an experienced paraglider, I am struggling with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subbandono told how, within hours of the appearance of paragliders of information about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages via the WhatsApp communicator to athletes attending the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
"It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing cash at the Newport mall on the Levee
According to a Newport police report, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink on Friday morning, who was filling in cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing for cash replenishment," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published release.
Another man "runs from behind to a Brink employee" and steals a bag of cash to an ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police didn't tell us how many people were involved in the robbery.
All persons with information on the identity of thieves are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person previously known as Kanye West”.
Forty-one-year-old musician has used the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before the visit to Saturday Night Live. During the performance, the artist is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who according to the creators gave up participation "for emotional reasons".
West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only abbreviated to his current artistic nickname, but has religious significance.
“I think “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In Scripture it means “You”, West said earlier in the year, discussing the title of an album with a radio presenter called Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, has announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former co-worker, also wrote down his alias in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and with capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use the army against civilians.
On Saturday, López Obrador, at Three Cultures Square, promised to "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance to learners as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert on artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, with China's increased activity in this area, the United States should double its research expenditure in the field of SI.
This comment relates to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official strategy for SI.
However, last year China presented its plan to become the most innovative state in the area of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"To start with, the budget for research on SI needs to be doubled: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview given this week, CNBC also said that doubling funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month's publication Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovision Ventures. The company has invested in one of the most significant companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system that defeated the best American player in the Othello game at the time. He then held a leadership position at Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of earlier technological initiatives of the American government, e.g. the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defense Area (DARPA) contest for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the struggle, because he thought it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to try very hard to get government subsidies.
"It is not China that takes away the best representatives of academic circles, but corporations," said Lee.
For several years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to develop SI.
"I believe that people who are dealing with artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctor's degree should automatically admit to a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan for the creation of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee pointed out, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to academics in a similar way to the US National Science Foundation and other government organisations that grant funds to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be involved in the work of partners from the world of industry and science, while the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced the allocation of USD 2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over USD 100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to set up a national committee on the security of artificial intelligence has not moved forward for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow the ten-year dispute with Greece to be resolved, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historical country of Macedonia is located, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has therefore vetoed the accession of the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said that he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging boycott raised doubts as to whether attendance would reach the minimum level of 50% required for the referendum to be declared binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young people in Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us all with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliwiera Georgijewska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
A change of name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The National Election Commission informed that no unusual events had been reported by 13 o’clock.
However, attendance at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. At that time 66% of the eligible people voted.
“I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the name of the country to open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents spread by boycotts of the referendum.
"We support membership of NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with their head up, not their back door," Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of the integration of the Eurasian people."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that a huge majority will support a change of name in a referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after voting.
He stated that the "yes" vote was a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute between 30 and 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required attendance.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in a Sunday referendum.
70% of those surveyed said that they would support the change of name.
In order for the vote to be successful, attendance must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since taking power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats Brighton's entire defense and scores the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home at a 2-0 Saturday for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The gate captured by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with a pitch to the Argentine attacker.
The football player outrun three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among four Brighton players.
First he played one of them, and then he overtakes the others, and he's at the edge of Brighton's Penitentiary Field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for it.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty field, which defeated goalie Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has a foot injury," said Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the opportunity to play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
"We were lucky to have scored the goal at that time."
However, it was Sterling who provided the blue lead in the Premier League duel.
The gate in question fell in the 29th minute.
In the action of this Aguero received the ball deep in the half of Brighton.
He sent a great pass along the left-hand side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a far pole.
Manchester City's attacker pointed the ball to the grid just before it fell on the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 pm. The meeting will be held at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning the Rockies.
After the loss of a chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to be in the first lineup.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to compete against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday as long as the Rockies keep their chances of playing in the playoff phase. Currently, the team has one more victory than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's meeting against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to win their first divisional title.
“Even though we are playing for nothing, at least we will go out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to be in this meeting?"
Nationals have not yet announced the launch pitcher for the Sunday meeting. However, the team tends to put Scherer in the first lineup.
It would be the thirty-fourth performance of Scherer in the first lineup. The player took part in the Thursday throw training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington records 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the batsmen and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
Trump's Day in West Virginia.
Trump did not explicitly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the half-election presidency.
"In November, we put all our achievements on the line.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running, I remain very active. I constantly defend our excellent candidates" - he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, mean and mean.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats carry out the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad, malicious, unpleasant and untrue."
The president referred to the Senate judicial committee, recalling by name the American senator from the Dienne Feinstein Democratic Party, what happened to the loud buzz of the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
«Uh, hello?
No... I mean... no». Her body language was terrible. It was the worst body language I had ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those expressing their own opinions
When the Momentum activists in my party voted to reprimand me, I was not surprised.
At the end of the day, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have recently been told that they are not welcome, and all this is because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion for reprimand was based on a disagreement between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
The Friday announcement of the meeting of Labour MPs from Nottingham East noted: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I have served as a Labour Party Member, most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently going on differently, and the promise of a "heartier and milder" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views, and every opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the party's leadership.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took the position of President, and colleagues who seemed to think that we had similar views began to expect me to change direction and take positions with which I would have disagreed earlier, with issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech – regardless of content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemnation of centristism or abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is to move on to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With each application for a "feel of mistrust" and every change in the rules of choice, the party's view is narrowed down.
In the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested to keep my head down and keep quiet, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the breakdown of my school class, I try to ensure better quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I've never covered up my beliefs, either, during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East County knew my position and knew there were differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the President of the Labourers in the face of the approaching Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour Party members and others): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threats of withdrawal of appointments or ad hoc political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 – Undefeated Ayr once again up
Two late touchdowns may have kind of warped the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr's team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga match.
The team is placed first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was a distinctive defense and a better take advantage of the opportunities that led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been pleased with his subjects.
"The games have been a challenge for us so far, but we are still invincible, so I am satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team stated: "We must pay respect to Ayr players. They took advantage of the opportunities that appeared."
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson was laid down and Frazier Clim was raised. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to even out the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr after kicking off the penalty kick just before the end of the first half. First he scored the touchdown, and then he took the chance to raise, gaining score 17:5 for Ayr.
The touchdown on Patrick Anderson by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a long suspension due to Ruaridha Knott's serious injury. The player was removed from the field on the stretcher. After Ayr resumed, he increased the lead after the application of Stafford McDowall and the increase in Clim.
Then, acting captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson's team received a yellow card. Melrose used its numbers again: a touchdown with an unexploited attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clim without the ball. MacPherson scored a touchdown on the back of the coming defense.
Climo took the chance to raise. Then he managed to raise the score again just after Kyle Rowe took the penalty shot and allowed the wingman Gregor Henry to score the fifth touchdown for the hosts.
The star of the Still Game series begins its career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems to be starting up in the catering industry. Recently discovered, he became the director of the restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC station sitcom. He performs and co-creates a series together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last season in the history of the show, all indications are that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the subject, although Scottish Sun's informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in a "growing catering industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the area of the naval base in La Paz.
There are blue flags flying from public buildings.
In naval ports, from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours by law.
It's our duty to get him back."
In the unaccessible sea of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum, and the inhabitants are unanimous, optimistic and counting on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be together to watch the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the Hague-based organisation will recognise Bolivia’s claim and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to enter into negotiations to grant the state independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who next year will face a controversial fight for reelection, also puts hope in a Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favorable ruling for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body established in the Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also stated that it would not affect the findings of any talks.
As Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments have been put forward.
Unfortunately, Bolivia's last four years could have taken the country away from its destination.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
Morales' relentless rhetoric deprived Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagreed that the decision-making process of the court was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin’s most popular presidents — was using the subject of sea access as part of the political game.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an excellent opportunity to see that we need to deal with the past."
The North Korean authorities claim that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that the “dream” is that the failure to abolish sanctions and the US’s opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington refuses to sign the declaration without Pjongyang taking concrete disarmament measures first.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the decommissioning of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows announce the appearance of the latest line of big headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a number of crazy, oversized headgears in their 2019 summer collection, which dazzled with style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats prevailed on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
Valentino's outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide feather roundabout flooding the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with gems, wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had their mouth sewn up and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and another looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with the big fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can be found in clothing stores.
Undersized hats follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a 61 cm wide roundabout that was worn by all — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which was poured through social media, presented another great creation on the runway — a straw beach bag almost as big as a model wearing a bathing suit.
The tanned orange reef bag, finished with tassels from the reef and crowned with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, said FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores the next summer, because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be difficult not to take advantage of the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills necessary for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue to enjoy their scientific achievements – in 2018 they were able to boast further excellent results of exams, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social projects.
The schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), attended by more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, aim to ensure the best level of service provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further and higher education, the career path they choose and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that has the opportunity to develop and implement a school-specific curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages are ranked first in league rankings, with the highest reporting rates for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher A rating.
Data from 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students obtained a higher A rating in Mandarin and 72 percent of the German learners, 69 percent of the French and 63 percent of the Spanish learners also obtained an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as subjects of choice, is conducted to the same extent as STEM learning (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that 17 percent of the employers' lack of language skills was responsible for the difficulties in filling vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring knowledge of languages,
Lifelong skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a great advantage in the future, regardless of the career development path chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to the 2013 YouGov survey of over 4000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit rate of 15%.
Therefore, investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of its languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interest, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from that will be taught by teaching staff specialised in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a learning environment that will equip their children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what their future may be.
At present, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country and must therefore be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a wide choice, diversity and level.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut on the Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, Laker coach, announced that LeBron James will play a Sunday preseason game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one but less than 48", said Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would most likely play a half-minute game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to be in pre-season matches to get ready," he said.
Trump electoral rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five election rallyes planned by Trump to take place next week, with stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his suspension of his post in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming elections at the halfway point of government, as the Republicans may be in danger of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's election rally tonight in West Virginia, and where will it be on the Internet?
Trump's election in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place today at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's election in West Virginia will be available to follow live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of the candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the envisaged vote in the Senate to suspend the election for a maximum of one week, pending an investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral rallies is to support Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign with five rallies next week aims to “mobilise volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives” — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the president's schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's campaign spokesman, who refused to give his name, Reuters.
Today's election rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the media from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which in 2016 he won by more than 40 percentage points — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's candidate for the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of fighting, keeping hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented concept of sport, but one that the players really believe in, and most of all in competitions like this.
So what's their momentum at this point?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're only four, so I think we have a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, is leading by four points, while there are twelve more to be won.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy role models, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of winning three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
Screaming all over his throat, a sign of excitement, became louder during his round, sinking the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas scored two holes in two blows.
His reflection on the land that gave them victory with the result of 15 met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
“Just focus and worry about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all that's left of each of those players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and was right.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't get bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game is played and how their energy seems to flow both to and from a noisy crowd proves that you should defeat these players on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal a potential European team victory on Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double double on the front of the Nine kicked the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they'd never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a change of strategy can happen in one moment.
Europe played better as a team so far and took a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team had a hard time fighting in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday football and foursome matches with the United States.
Inspired by his duet, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he charged two victories over Tiger Woods, increasing his previous score on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the invaluable American team in the early fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make up for the losses.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points out of the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari (the team was called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) are only the second pair in the history of Ryder Cup, which scored four points in four opening matches.
After they crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in a great-style four-ball format, they defeated the pumped-out Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who got tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed flashes of genius, but has so far lost 19 out of 29 football and foursome matches, and that's seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with world ranking positions 1 and 3 respectively.
However, the European team did not go along on this pleasant, cold day in a field southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-time chief winner, set a reference point for the Americans, scored two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with 2&1 on Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has the team done a four-point loss by starting singles, although Furyka's team would only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, in the second place two days ago, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says "strongly no" to unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday during a speech at the United Nations that the non-abuse of sanctions only aggravates the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that the country unilaterally gave up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any specific answer from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's reluctance to "gradual" approach to denucleation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, its statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as it did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to work for the “denuklerarisation of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised guarantees of the security of North Korea.
North Korea was awaiting the formal end of the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. representative announced that Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted calls to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "dencularisation in the first place" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, even opposing the signing of the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who behave in an ignorant way towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of abolition of sanctions is exacerbated by our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed by the United States leader at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea were a party to denucleation and not the United States, then there was no impasse in the denucleation of the Korean Peninsula".
Mim this, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles in the United States was inevitable after Mr Evil President Trump (Mr Evil Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (the man of the rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations Trump, which last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, he commended Kim Jong Un for his courage to take steps to disarm, but he also said that much work still needed to be done, and he also said that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set a time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue and continue until we find full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to suppress the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for “making gangster demands”.
North Korea has committed itself this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in to dismantle the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate measures” he cared about were security guarantees, which Trump had committed himself to in Singapore, and that he had taken steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on adequate rest
The new course at Harvard University this year provided all students with more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of learning by “all-night caffeine-driven students”.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basis for taking care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a course by giving a speech about the influence of sleep deprivation on science.
"After the speech, one girl came up to me and said, "Why is it only now that I'm in my senior year?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sport, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health service, said that this course was decided to be introduced after it was stated that students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of the dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not cause an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what health effects smoking brings”, added Professor Cheisler
The culture of pride from "all night long learning" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means an ever-increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Providing enough sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger mode, and the student is constantly hungry," he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set a reminder alarm when they need to go to sleep and when they need to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful influence of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can upset the daily rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes out Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during the fighting on the departure in Livingston, when Dolly Menga fired his shot to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's disassembled band, with a score of 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first victory from the 4-1 triumph recorded in February over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches, making for his team a difference of eight points compared to the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Ranger squad showing no commitment didn't look like it was going to improve.
While the Rangers were down to number six, Livingston climbed to number three, just behind the Hibernian with a single goal.
The Ranger team may have further problems with the need to treat Calum Spence's head wound after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which allowed him to outrun Ayr and move on to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same 11 Livingston, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, being delighted by the way that his well-trained team tormented their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitch allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the helper didn't take his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his friend Alan Lithgow, playing in the position of defender, could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in three-quarters of an hour, but it looked like they had more hope than they had of believing in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he deserved a penalty throw 15 minutes before the game ended, when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson broke the Colombian claim.
The Rangers only managed to fire two good shots in the first half, but the former goalie Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely concerned about the head of Lassana Coulibala and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While the goal scored by Livingston in 34 minutes of opening the match could be against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into winning it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with the deep fixed part of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept his cool, passing it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard was busy on his break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it by coming from his position.
The Livingston team continued dragging guests into the game exactly as they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett made long passes one after another.
Holt's team may have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor's got a good shot at Jacobs, and then Lithgov dropped the game from the corner.
The Ranger Reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a penalty throw when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our release "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now you can hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise hostile cells as part of the treatment.
This method consists in separating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein common to many cancers. Then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system, the loss of ovarian cancer has been observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that this vaccine is very promising".
HER2 "powered the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to locate cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trumpet diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA cap on her head.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was "exploded" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing that night his third piece titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he conducted a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by a comedian named Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
"They're after me backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're after me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You say I have no choice,” adding: “I will wear a superman’s cape, so that you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Let's accept."
His words caused the audience to “bull” twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed,” says Variety. The person in the studio during these events: “The studio was quiet. ”
West was invited to the show to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of I Love it in disguise of a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUS group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: Thank you for coming to MAFIA."
Karen Hunter on her Twitter talk show said that West simply "was himself and it is absolutely wonderful".
"However, I will NOT reward people (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art"), which I believe accepts and spreads an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
Similarly, we are free," she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that now "his name is formally Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy’s footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend Prince changed his name into a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder of stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man on Friday at a restaurant in East Belfast.
The incident took place at Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the D.A.'s office.
Star Game of the Throne Kit Harington addresses the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO "Game of Thrones" series.
A 31-year-old actor hit the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think that they have to act tough to be respected.
In his interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner on the Game of Thrones plan, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt confident enough to address the issue.
“I personally feel quite confident at this point — where did we make a mistake about masculinity?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are natural and learned?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, what makes young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It is clear that not everything is right with young men."
In his interview he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones after the end of the series next year, saying that "he had finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in Sam Shepard's "True West" play, which is a story about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"On the set I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emmy fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, an object of love for the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people affected by this problem, as reported by healthcare professionals in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to one year.
Transmitting HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured widespread access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team has revealed the data of Republican Senators — these are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”.
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the allegations that a member of her team had posted personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website of the above-mentioned legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party assured that these accusations were made by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wings".
“ Lies, lies, and even more vile lies,” reported Waters in a Twitter statement.
The public information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
It was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing with the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and published information about a member of the Waters team, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantiated charge is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie," continued Waters.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless charge is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
"This kind of denial is wrong," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke you.
He can't question the motives of the defendant.
For that, he must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent accusations".
"The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to legal responsibility for all their activities which pose a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Review of the movie Johnny English: Knockout — Spy parody with the weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new British theme film has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of films of the genre of action and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the screens of cinemas in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-loathing satire of how hopeless we are become the new export product of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, who is always surprised by his rubber face, has again been licensed to screw up — his name, more than anything else, signals that he is an elaborate, comical creation designed for non-English speaking audiences.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre tastes for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jack Bean and a hint of this guy adding one note to the theme tune of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world mystery man — Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, there is one or two moments worth mentioning.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by rotor blades.
On the screen you can clearly see Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially since nowadays also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be directed at children rather than adults — in my opinion, Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as inventive and coherent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Jasie Bean.
It has always been the current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker penetrates the British supersecret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British operatives in the field — to the horror of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's bitterness spell, which is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power by acting as Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to expand her wings.
Her intelligence advisors are telling her that she's gonna have to reinstate one of the retired agents because of the identity of all active spies.
And that means incompetent Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving informal lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few good gags while giving English spy lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for a briefing, reconnecting with his former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine commander — a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of the party in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously overtaken by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problems — the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters, they set the French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by sneaking on board the luxury yacht Volta; and English wreak havoc when using the virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
In this last sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite a nice and loud performance, the whole film is very similar to children's TV.
It's a typical medium.
As with other Johnny English films, I could not resist thinking: can the British film industry not give Rowanów Atkinson a role that would really suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that provides for a four-day working week for the British for which they will receive a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party will consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a five-day salary.
It is said that the party wants the heads of companies to pass on savings to employees through the revolution associated with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
As a result, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of pay.
Sources say that this idea "will enter" into the party's economic programme and plans to go out to meet employees.
The transition to a four-day working week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from a change in the economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party in an interview with The Sunday Times said: "He expects a change of policy to be announced by the end of this year".
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is something that fits into the party's approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea — the Green Party has committed itself to introducing a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and its implementation is not considered by the Labour Party".
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Room, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from faceless directors and speculators in utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor from the Shadow Office also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not regain their full participation, because the Labour Government could make "deductions" based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer on the 60-minutes program to whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can change their attitude.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and caused the question as to whether the findings of the investigation office could have led Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview conducted on Sunday with the 60 minutes program, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that might lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his friend from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh on the way to the hearing.
I called him after the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, firm and clear."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and a strong plea is needed to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people she gives could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival event and has it contributed to any reduction in poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, with an annual musical event that boasts an impressive composition of stars and an equally impressive mission to eradicate global poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless you have decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, making a phone call or other significant activities to help raise awareness about the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen boast over the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011 it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped world leaders to make commitments and regulations worth more than USD 37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and developers involved in “helping children to reach their full potential”, which promised to hand over 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country, after Global Citizen members sent over 4700 tweets.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustice, such as malnutrition, fall into history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that, following more than 5000 actions calling on Britain to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was "How can we be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?",
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the great civil rights movements of our time and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars of this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports — Secretary of Interior
Washington may “if necessary” resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government — was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate the energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, thanks to its navy, has the opportunity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to “a pony that knows one trick” with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements were made at a time when the Trump administration continued its mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump officials, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is purely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States triggered a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she'd consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would consider running for president.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix a corrupt government, and it’s also true for women in the highest position,” said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy for President."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who choose the option “probably” said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of those who supported his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed him.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into consideration regarding the potential candidacy in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) by Track Palin at Donald Trump's election rally
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with," she said to the audience at Donald Trump's election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son "a taboo theme", and then said about her son and other war veterans: "They come back a little changed, come back tough, come back, wonder if respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other military members have given to their country."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, urging him to make false statements in a report on domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon, as Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, stated.
18 States and District of Colombia support the fight against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for a new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiæ letter in Washington to support an asylum seeker struggling with this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberty Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his violent sons from the gang” abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the USA, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the state, federal and international laws that have been in force for decades".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the amicus curic.
The prosecutors further argued in their letter that a policy refusing immigrants entry harms the economy of the United States, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "be a necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Azil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or because they belong to a particular social group or have such and not other political beliefs,” said the Sessions in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people from all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu when the number of deaths has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Embulance brings bodies every minute.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through things soaked in water and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, quickly overflowed.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured spine and arm, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes, as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of a hotel that shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I've been squeezed into the rubble of the wall," Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family came to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and her voice went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Ambassador accuses China of “harassing” propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial in an American daily newspaper that commended the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily pay-per-view in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States Congress elections on 6 November, China contradicts this allegation.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections confirmed what American officials said to Reuters that this is a new stage in Washington's escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently conducting an escalation of the trade war, which has led to an increase in tariffs for reciprocal imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of the State of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has done harm to American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register that China "is now starting to harass with double force, placing propaganda advertising in our own free press".
"By asserting its propaganda, the Chinese government enjoys a respected American tradition of free speech and free press, placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
On the other hand, there will be no opposition in the newsstand in Beijing and no real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic direction taken by China, given that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate themselves before mid-term elections women with voting rights through the Kavanaugh scandal, warn analysts
While many leading Republicans support and defend the nominee for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that you will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions behind this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already want to vote officially.
“This cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon)'s efforts to conduct a last-minute investigation by the FBI were enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it by November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to a Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “Nov is coming”, demonstrating in the Senate lobby because Republicans had decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale," said one of Stu Rothenberg's news sites, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and it is true.
But it can be taller, especially among the indecisive women from the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans had decided to approve the candidacy, it might have been a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with a lot of mess," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about the way the Republicans handled this situation and how Ford was treated," stated Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, on one of the news channels, a group that helps to select the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe in front of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter has a little more support.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38% of the respondents claimed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during the deposition, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI began investigating Ford’s allegations as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified on oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week that Kavanaugh was under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during his admission at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of the creation of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "webshop with personal data" or POD.

Bernard Vann: recognition of a clergyman with the Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman of England, who during World War I was awarded the Victoria Cross, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918 for his assault on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandkids unveiled a memorial stone at the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly on the centenary of his grandfather's award was "a uniquely symbolic character".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
Then he rushed into the line of fire and led it forward with “the greatest courage” and single-handedly launched an attack on the field division, disposing of three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never cope with, but at the same time something humble."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the end of the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to be able to participate in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people.”
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206's emotion-packed gala and finally not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program contained 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, British viewers were shocked by the change of program to Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they didn't sleep until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
One Twitter fan described the switch to a cartoon for children as "some sick joke".
"According to the government regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Pepp's Pig, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said that they would work out a schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"When I think about a repeat of the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
“But it is Sunday six o’clock in the morning, so that we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change of program there, we were covered with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't a glitch. It was a legal issue.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to a standard quantity. We wanted to please the fans too much, and unfortunately we overreached.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but he was motivated to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program Radio 4 run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this broadcast for many years, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of her illness.
When he appeared in the program run by Laverne for the first time, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said, "To this day, this sense of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that he was "worthy" so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
Two times the bronze Olympic medalist became a loud LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's United Nations Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he wanted to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give others “hope”.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, surprised him.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, pointing out that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death because of cancer three years later,” he said, “he found it difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"Last year was the most important thing for me to win a gold medal," he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him: “You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad”, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympic Games — was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — the Proud song performed by Heather Small — that accompanied him in his preparations for the Olympic Games and that still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no Mickelson form on the bench during the Saturday Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form to keep his mark on it.
Mickelson, playing for the 12th time in a biennial event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furic for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case with his team in the United States, the five-time main winner had to spend the day cheering the team and working on improving his game in the hope of correcting the reason for his bench assignment.
A 48-year-old who has never given the simplest punches, even at the peak of his career, does not work well on the narrow field of Le Golf National, where vicious blows are ruthlessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday he must face the precision of the winner of the British Open — Francesca Molinari, who joined forces with the debutante Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start playing with a verve, Mickelson's match can prove extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player — I don’t think he could have done anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, held me with his hand, and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He's in the celebrity gallery and he's brought a lot to play his bands in the past as well as this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it happened, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson's got 18 wins, 20 losses, seven draws, and Furyk said his presence brought a lot to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, mocking, and it's good to have him in the band room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings much more to his person than just a game."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a large point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult gameplay.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in the Valderrama field, where he and his fellow vice-captain, Sev Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“We can’t forget that we had a big advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the Valderrama field we won only by a hair,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave the lead 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
Time will tell me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, you're doing your best.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will only be when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal of winning a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said from the beginning that I was focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: “I would not have done better.
But tomorrow is different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's another issue.
It's good to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you're playing alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
This message that has to be conveyed to the players is to give it everything tomorrow.
The partner must also do his best."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results on their own than when playing with their partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced big twists on the last day, being a member of the winning team in the Brookline field, and then failed after the European team had performed “a miracle in the Medinah field”.
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, was warming up to fight his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we are playing 12 important games — you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this momentum goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our lineup and set up the boys in a way that would make it possible for us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of counterattacking Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players in the leading half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he can handle the whole game," Bjorn told Bjorn about his singles election.
New German warship again delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year, due to faulty systems and alarming costs, as reported by the local media.
The release of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the Navy in 2014, but due to the problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the 2007 Navy will replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles, as well as technological solutions preventing detection, ensuring, among others, reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to exploit new frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 appeared on the front page of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key "software and hardware failures" that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
The software flaws were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, which is half the size of the Bremen class's older frigate.
It also turned out that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and reduces the possibility for the Navy to carry out future upgrades.
It is believed that the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7000 tonnes is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — also becomes a problem.
It is said that it reached a stunning level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of putting new frigates into service are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings regarding the shrinking strength of the German maritime fleet.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy "has completed ships capable of using".
He also said that this problem had increased over time as a result of the decommissioning of old units without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the navy.
National Trust eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research on the Scottish Highlands estate is designed to show how bats use the landscape for food.
Research is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help to steer future efforts to protect them.
Research conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will concern midgets and small ones, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the Red Night family in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property special recorders will be placed to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field studies using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the behaviour of individual species.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS's conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the girdles and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can flies and certain chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of night hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex technique of echolocation to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, inspections of the girdle, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even founded the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the property Three in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says it's the perfect territory for bats.
"Three has a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of bat control before the maintenance work is carried out in the estates, since the involuntary destruction of one girdle can kill up to 400 females and young, which could result in the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing, harassing, or disturbing them, and destroying their girdles is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in the case of many species, we don't even know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges, while his lawyers intend to sue the German warehouse
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's reports, Der Spiegel had to pay a woman $375,000 to keep quiet.
Ronaldo (33 years old), several hours after the charges were announced, in an instagram live broadcast addressed to his 142 million followers, described these reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said five-time gold ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I am happy and everything is fine", added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for allegations that they called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection”, says Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer would claim compensation for “moral harm in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the Ronaldo and Mayorga nightclub, they reportedly went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped a woman with an anus — according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that “99 percent is a good guy” who was deceived by this “one percent”.
According to Ronaldo's records, he confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in the hospital, but then she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was afraid of "retaliation" and "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she still can't forget the alleged incident.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying EUR 100 million for it.
Brexit: UK “for all time would regret” the departure of car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car production after leaving the European Union, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was “worried” when a representative of Toyota UK said in an interview with the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
A representative of a Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, then production will be stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, as car manufacturers claim, are the risks associated with the supply chain when the UK leaves the European Union without agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to its factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border control".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only enable us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make the most of the situation," said BBC Radio 4 in today's programme.
"The statements not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, show that we must be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient set of supply chains."
Toyota’s representation was unable to determine how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and has been a member of the Unite Association Council, said that the union members are becoming more and more concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are destroyed, they will never be reinstated again.
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed by another week because of the ongoing struggle for the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as reported on Sunday by the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in elections, links between close colleagues of Trump and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was going to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, and there was a postponement of the meeting to avoid interfering with the hearing of the senate judicial commission, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week and may be postponed for another week, taking into account all events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll let the press know."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The programmer, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by a reluctance to "ostentatious" television journalists, and added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentatious".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President is conducting more "questions and answers" sessions than any other President before him," she said, adding without providing evidence: "We have met with numbers".
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which we will be able to talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, acting too freely and sometimes bizarrely in front of the journalists gathered.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the countries of the European Union working in the Scottish health service to express their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave on Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of processing applications for "sttled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations for the UK’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer, and appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head trauma
The charging Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a failure of the Tennessee team with a score of 31-27, reported Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the sideline, and then he fell to the ground," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then put him on a stretcher and carried him out for further tests.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (student of the second year released from representing the university for a year to improve his skills) plays his first season in Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ended, he had five charge, which gives him 18 charge throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax fee when buying real estate in the UK
According to the new tories plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate.
The increase in tax fees will include those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury predicts that in this way it will get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May today will inform that foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax fee, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to bridge Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate with the promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden of more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and non-tax-deductive companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
In addition to the current tax charge, including the higher second - house and rental rates introduced two years ago, the additional charge may amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to yield up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents in other countries, leading to an increase in prices and hindering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time outside the country, many prosperous regions — especially the capital — have turned into “ghost cities”.
The new rules come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has been called on to reduce his taxes to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of low-cost housing in order to liquidate the "residential scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the eviction “for no reason”.
It also wants to give local authorities more power to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I would commit myself to rebuilding the British dream that every next generation would be better than the previous generation.
This also means repairing our unstable housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can equally easily buy property here as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become very distant, but the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish selector."
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, says that his "biggest ambition" is to become Scotland's selector at some point.
This 40-year-old Scotsman is committed to healing the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after the last season he introduced St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I was only able to get to B's staff," said Ross in an interview for BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched the Scottish matches in Hampden with my father, and I was always attracted to it.
However, this possibility will only come if I succeed as a club coach."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's coaching position include Dick Advocate, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel intimidated by taking on the role of such prominent figures in such a large club, rejecting previously offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now success will be measured for me whether I can bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and its facilities, there is no doubt its place," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have succeeded here, only if I succeed."
Ross' coaching career lasted only three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months he was a member of the Hearts team.
Then he helped Alloa get promoted again after the third league, and in the following season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the fall to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he's feeling a lot more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real turning point,” recalls Coach Alloa.
“I really believed that running a team was much better for me than just playing.
It's gonna sound weird because as a player, I've done well, I've made good money, and I've achieved some tangible successes.
But playing is a hard piece of bread.
You have to go through different situations every week.
They still happen to me when it comes to the stress and pressure of coaching, but I feel good about the role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most at home in my entire adult life."

Research shows that the best time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave caused a sudden influx of customers to British pubs, but it bounced with hiccups in the chain of restaurants.
Research shows that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting company that produced the data, says: “The constant heat and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the results of July to develop in a similar way to June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings fell even more.
The 1.8% decrease in sales in restaurants recorded in June has increased even further.
The pubs and bars that offered drinks did their best — their sales growth surpassed the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars has increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food has dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM’s entertainment and tourism analysis company says: “These results have been in line with the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the volume of consumption 'outside the house' remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences, given the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for owners of food establishments and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring so much needed respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion. It sets recognised industry standards.
One in five kids has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents.
Studies have shown that one in five children — some of whom are only 11 — have secret social networking accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
The survey conducted among 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
These reports have exacerbated concerns that sexual content is published on them.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children — some of whom are only 11 years of age — have social networking accounts that they do not reveal to adults.
A survey conducted among 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts — the name refers to the Instagram site where you can share photos.
These reports have exacerbated concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that they had a “main” account that they showed their parents, and that they also had private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenage girl who encouraged others to "rape" her.
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of the board of directors of Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for people who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience that she gained in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that introducing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very happy to have the opportunity to give the board the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really help with sports management in Scotland."
An American who among his four Olympic gold medals has won 200 and 400 metres in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly performs in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell me if I was going to be able to recover and to what extent.
It was a gruesome job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and went back to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!"
Lactator advertising, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactose company caused a storm on the Internet, publishing an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
In order to announce the launch of the world's first “silent breast-feeding under clothing”, its producer, Elvie, published a mocking ad in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it offers to mothers.
It depicts four true mothers dancing in a hay - filled cowshed to a song where they hear the words: "Yes, I milk, but you can't see the tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not just uddering my tits".
Refren goes like this: “Pump them, pump them, feed them to the children, pump them, pump them, milk their ladies.”
Advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused a lot of controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many say that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people who give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their children are taken away from them after a few days from birth," wrote one user.
Elvie Lactator can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactating for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: "This advertisement is completely disconnected from reality".
Other defenders of the video — one of the women said that she thought the song was “funny”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I pulled out the food.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for the bottom line.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a funny commercial for mothers who pull out food (often at work or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactating women attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many nursing women feel like cows.
However, the Lactator Elvie is completely silent, there are no wires or tubes and you can wear it unnoticed under the breast to feed, which gives women the freedom to move, to hold the children on their hands, and even to leave the house while pulling out the food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and provocative premiere.
By bringing together feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of food withdrawal, while also presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
It's not the first time Elvie's lactator has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, during Marta Jakubowski's show, a mother of two children appeared on the runway with this product attached to it.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detainees is rising rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border every month does not change, partly because the strict rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration made it difficult for children to be placed on sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being exposed to deportation if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the common holding would be fingerprinted, which would then be transferred to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who volunteered as sponsors for unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior record.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing them," said Albence.
The staff of the shelter say that, as part of their efforts to speed up the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as in previous standards.
Much will be done through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter staff and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious in larger centres, such as Tornillo, where it is easier to overlook the signals that something bad is happening to the child because of its size.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them the right time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces reside illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem claims that “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "bring its holy battle to the cleansing of the territory of Syria" both from terrorist groups and from "any foreigner who is illegally present".
Currently, approximately 2,000 American soldiers are stationed in Syria, who are mainly involved in training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in a war - destroyed country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused them of “some Western countries” of “arousing irrational fear” that discouraged them from returning.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help us with these returns," he said.
"They politicise matters which should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad has entered into a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped to prevent a large Syrian attack on a province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear time frame", and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida-related Levant People's Defence Front, who would be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the governing party and opposition to draw up a draft of the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Mr Mouale outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "verifying the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected to a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency would have ended in an early removal from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far".
So far, there's no sign of weariness.
Since 2014, CNN's primary ratings have doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's almost tripled, up to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average 2.4 million viewers are attracted during peak audience hours, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast on MSNBC has achieved the highest performance in cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers of evening news programmes.
“People fly like moths to the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the main producer of ABC’s “Designated Survival” series about the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers her driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
"Chaos has entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the admissibility of joining immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Disengagement is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch the sixth hour panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of confidential informants when writing the book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket ("pretty clothes", as The Washington Post said) or about the implications of shocking descriptions of the details of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario the way I used to.
"What he does is partly like a reality show in terms of delivering new content every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and daily twists of Trump's action (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss the episode, 'cause you're gonna be behind.
When I met Mike Fleisch this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where it has its home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows before, and people were saying, "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleisch told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Inflow of money from outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the constituencies, as a result of which, in the race for one post, two current congressmen, a river of cash flows to the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania.
This recently established suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by a representative of Democrats, Conor Lamb, who obtained his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former district of the 12th in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new district of 17.
The maps of the districts were revised after the January ruling of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were designated unfairly, which gave the Republicans an advantage and was against the constitution.
The race in the new district of 17 began with the campaign struggle between the main funding bodies of the party — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became popular in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair in the widely commented elections to the 18th constituency, which took place in March.
The Republican has been in this position for over a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Policy experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but has withdrawn from this idea
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing despite a slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until his partners expelled Trump Organization, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials decided to cancel the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan”, as said in her statement of this month's department spokesman Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions considered were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received 140 million dollars of aid from the United States to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to include restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very severe for this Central American country, which is suffering from high unemployment and high murder rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the conclusions of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, officials at the top level made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now, at a conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is about to present as a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the assembly.
Three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three US officials, including two diplomats, who, provided they were anonymous, agreed to discuss internal negotiations.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also investigates whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If Congress changes its composition, President Trump will be held accountable by him while preparing for a re-approach before the voters, and perhaps even tried before the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump — and of those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice which will decide how much longer this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The railways of history revolve around these turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There's a few turning points in front of the Americans now.
What are we going to do if Donald Trump releases Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that he proposed a secret video of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh proves incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
Above all, in the middle of the presidential term, will we choose individuals to hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials, difficult times will come for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Shabbas candles on that table marked with swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how could I not look to the future optimistically?"

Rangers player, Graham Dorrans, is looking forward to a match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the awareness that the victory with the Austrians, after the impressive Villareal draw achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of becoming a member of the G League of Europe.
Until tie 2:2 with Villareal knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers like a trampoline for greater success.
"It was good for us because Villarreal is in good shape," said a 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something — and we scored a point.
We may have been able to push them at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it is another important night for Europe.
We hope we can score three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has scored a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that with the support of the fans we will pass this and we will win a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of retirement savings spends women's sleep
Although those who took part in the survey knew exactly how they wanted them to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family.
In a study carried out by Nationwide, about half of the participants stated that they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide, who sells life insurance.
Where do I start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you express your will.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how you want to be looked after, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent this from happening to court battles.
Appoint a trusted healthcare representative who will supervise it and ensure that the right people act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also hiring a proxy to handle the finances.
Choose the person you trust, because they will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all the bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all the information you need so you can have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it's about who doctors are,” asks Martin.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan at hand."
Man shot multiple times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a gun gun on his way home from an evening party.
The 40-pounder was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries we sustained do not endanger a man's life, and the police are requesting witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu on Friday.
Due to broken communication, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal kabupatene, which is located north of Palu, closer to the 7.5 degree earthquake epicenter.
After the Palu disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the kabupaten of Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates, in 2017 it was inhabited by 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupatene (administrative unit with a level below the province) extending along the northwest coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 there were 299 200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the Central Celebes economy, which have developed especially in the coastal cabupate of Donggal.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disaster Effects, the earthquakes and tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in the western Donggala.
Indonesia is located on a seismicly active Pacific ring of fire, causing earthquakes to occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on 26 December struck the western coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra caused tsunamis in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra was hit by a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on Nias off Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, there was an earthquake of 6.8 degrees, causing tsunamis that entered the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, there was an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
More than 1,100 people died as a result of the attack.
2010: The 7.5 degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the Kabupaten Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the damage that the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They destroyed thousands of homes and caused temporary problems for thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the vice-presidental candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Wasilla, Alaska, a 29-year-old boy was arrested with domestic violence charges, obstruction of filing an application and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
KTUU Station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody with a 500-dollar bail.
According to her information, last Saturday he was brought to trial, where in his defense speech he stated that he was “certainly innocent”.
On Palina, there are three class A misdemeanors, which means that he may receive a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with class B misdemeanors, for which he is facing a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veteran Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of registration and possession of weapons intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son's aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder he acquired during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people were killed by tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake on Friday that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
An earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
An earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors from New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck that was run over by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to the notification in the Southern District of New York about the intention to claim the death penalty in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury presented Saipov with an indictment covering 22 items, including eight counts of murder in illegal activity — which is usually followed by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases — and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required “strateful planning and reflection”. The way Saipov conducted it, they described it as “monster, cruel and immoral”.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought injury, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucc," states.
Five of the victims were Argentina's nationals who were in New York City for tourism.
The latest death penalty in the South District of New York City was filed ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually in September 2009 he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which came from Uzbekistan, he showed no remorse within months of the attack.
The police say he told the investigators he was comfortable with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to the police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
A charge of 22 counts says he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov, said that they are “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after confession will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought upon all the persons concerned," he said.
Saipov's defense team has asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory Parliamentist NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest, which took place during the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize an army of people”.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told the demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit, "The United Kingdom would have been out of the Union already".
However, the inclusion of the Tories in favour of staying in the community in a separate protest against Brexit that took place in the city further underlined the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her compromise plan with the Chequers among the attacks by Brexit's supporters, his opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite her opposition, she will seek an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to "pull the plan from the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become the proxy, to whom responsibility should be delegated for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was involved, we would be out of the Union now," he said.
A Member of Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers plan."
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to be our own rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their minds since the vote in 2016: "The thought that the British changed their minds and wanted to remain in the Union is completely false".
The demonstration also featured Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party, who said to the reporters: “I am just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who populate the streets and who chose us do not support it either.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In her speech to Prime Minister May, she added: "Premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage stated that politicians involved in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say "we won't let you do it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of betraying Brexit feel hot.
"We are mobilising an army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
During this time, the opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved "Torys vs Brexit" banners after setting up a group this weekend.
Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at conservatives for the security problems of party applications at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who claim to be able to organize IT systems and all the technology to handle the Canada plus plus plan, the liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren is planning to "seriously consider" running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, he will "consider seriously running for president."
According to The Boston Globe, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will be running for reelection in November. Her opponent will be the Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula, since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government — and she also means the woman at the top.”
Arrest of the perpetrator of the fatal shooting in which the LSU team player, Wayde Sims, was killed
Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana reported the arrest of a suspect in the Friday shooting in which a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims, was killed on Saturday.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at a conference that took place at 11:00 East Time.
On Friday, a recording of the shooting was released asking for help in identifying the man on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun and died," said the media chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, according to the 247sports service.
Wayde stood up for a friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde.
After arresting him, during which he did not resist, he was taken into custody at East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
At 1.98 m, the junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, and in the last season he took off 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the dance floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's command allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who took off from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the service station first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the cape's tail, which should determine the fate of the race.
The Mercedes driver drove into the boxing lane in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-in-the-wheel action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking being pushed to the defensive after the double move of his rival to defend his position in the third corner, Hamilton stepped forward.
Max Verstappen took off at the end of the bet, and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was placed seventh.
Then, for a large part of the race, he drove because he did not change the tyres to make a quick finish and take away Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth position.
Finally, he drove to the service station on the 44th lap, but in the remaining eight laps he was no longer able to accelerate.
"It's been a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me pass.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she had not revealed the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the nominee for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Christina Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are “sleazy, malicious and lying”.
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for several days, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, mean, malicious and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it'.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't expose her."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't," he added, mocking the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," says Feinstein in front of the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to be discreet, and according to her request, I did not disclose these contents."
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I am telling you, it was a really bad speech of the body.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of a candidate for Supreme Court Judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats are using the insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
You can see the malice, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee club Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants team
The Dundee Stars have atone for their Friday loss in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants team, winning a rematch at home on Saturday 5:3.
The giants quickly gained a double-gate advantage from the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowne evened the score, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard again evened the score, scored for the Dundee team, and two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's wards, who, despite their initial losses on Friday night, won with the Dundee team in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season — the first three games were won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaulla's ace. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's ace.
After the intense opening at 13:10 a.m. Sullivan brought the host team back into play, and then Matt Marquartt evened the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period of the evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard re-matched the score with a goal scored in the lead game in 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second period, Cowne and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to give Dundee the first lead in this game. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last three years by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost four games for their last five games will play at their place in Milton Keynes on Friday.
The air traffic controller is dying to help hundreds of people on the plane escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller from Indonesia was hailed a hero after he died, helping the plane safely take off with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing after a major earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still severe secondary shocks in the area, and in the city of Palu many people have been trapped in the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the rocked air control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from Australian ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller’s decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This message has torn our hearts out," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands. The national disaster relief agency reports that the access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase, because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Six meters of tsunami waves destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said Sky News: “The ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
We're running out of drinking water.
Small shops are looted."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu and said to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
This year, Indonesia has already been hit by an earthquake that has killed over 550 people on the island of Lombok.
The plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Airlines operating a flight that crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific have reported that one person is missing and have previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members have been safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that, according to the Saturday afternoon, they couldn't count on one man who was traveling on a bad plane.
They assured us that they were working together with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airlines said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the disaster, and it is also unknown how it was conducted.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
"This has helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the striped water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the cabin crew were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue was also helped by sailors who were working nearby to modernise the waterfront. They were able to transport people to shore with a blowboat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to data from Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea, but there is no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the D.A.'s office finished presenting evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as a forensic expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how he retraced the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on a bad night, and thus overturned his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was on Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When he asked the prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted her contact details, as well as texts and calls.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense's final speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed — What Is Aware of Hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling its music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed group from Bristol, today's hip-hop has left the original political and social issues.
The team wants to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the works of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in Great Britain.
Another black?!
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for parole after a "racist" text.
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal from her racist work after receiving a misaddressed text in which the child's mother complains that she is "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly consternated when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who stood up for her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“ NOEE, THE SAME NINE PERSON,” she wrote in her husband’s text.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to reports from the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had made a mistake, Gisella Maurice was fired by "committed" and said that her loving nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job badly and was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now she demands compensation from a couple for a release of $350 a day, multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed with a residence, although she did not sign a contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do things like that," she said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified because, after they insulted her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Lent’s husband, Joel Plasco.
"Would you entrust your children to the person you have hurt, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
By comparing the lawsuit to "slash", Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to blow something like this?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public quickly passed a few judgments on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington books were afraid that readers would not feel a connection with the talking bear.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says of the letter: “It is hard to put herself in the place of the person who read it for the first time before publishing the book.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She claims that her father, who, before a little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected, and adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book seemed "sweet-bitter".
About Paddington, who he describes as “a very important member of our family”, says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, not boasting,” he adds.
“But since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you felt proud of him, even though it was not your doing.
I think Paddington's success was something like that.
Although he invented it and created it, he always did the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"He called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn't make it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly stopped working and were eliminated from the body.
She died some time earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit back and wait and realize that it was all developing.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was with other people.
I had to hold on real tight."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the suffering she had been through.
"No one knew," she said.
My head was down, and my tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
I felt like I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards from grieving women are supposed to help prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed, and he took his own life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day, ” he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could brighten up any room with it."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place”.
Tyler's brother was 11 years old in 2014, and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people to talk to and talk to, even if they are just friends.
Don't stay quiet, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, sad or anything, ” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It’s tearing a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance because the FBI is launching an investigation.
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — a limited time-scale and limited-scale investigation — perhaps we could reach some unanimity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would “fall apart” into opposing camps, leading to stalemate.
Why would Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
The election for Congress is in a few weeks — November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans lose it, the chances of choosing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly diminish.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of refugees from North Korea is decreasing.
According to the South Korean legislator, since seven years ago Kim Jong Un took power, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South has fallen.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1127 escapes last year and 2706 in 2011.
According to him, more accurate border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates for human smugglers are key factors that have affected this situation.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are eventually proposed citizenship of South Korea.
According to Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the border has been illegally crossed by more than 30,000 North Koreans.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back to the country by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where they had talks about negotiations on denucleation that had previously become at a standstill.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore. The result of this meeting is a general agreement to clean the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of a lack of progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under the circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and said that he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during an interview she gave at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I think if a woman behaved like this, she would be considered a 'hysteric'," Pelosi told Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh had given to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family issues and high school years.
He also clearly chased the Democrats from the committee, setting out the allegations of a "grotesque and coordinated attack on reputation" organised by liberals who were furious that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because he exposed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by issuing these statements as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's removal from office if he had been nominated and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court but also serve in the court in which he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she fears the possible rulings of Kavanaugh on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person into court who expects us to say 'how wonderful it is'," Pelosi added.
And women must rule it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of raging rage, and she can't get it out of her mouth without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"That's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager at a company. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she figured out a way that when she got nervous and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry'.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an outlet of anger partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most prominent memories of one of the first positions in an office dominated by men is how one day I started crying out of unspeakable rage. An elderly woman, a cool manager who I always feared, grabbed my neck and led me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they've baked you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his mistress on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated with Patricia's borders, she realized that she might actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
"It was not a thought-out decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates for the election, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder was behind in raising funds and promised herself she wouldn't race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During her speech announcing that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions — gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and rage at sexism — that her voice was tied in her throat.
“ You might think I had a nervous breakdown, ” he recalls.
"You might think I'm being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.

What are the benefits of Beijing's economic war between the United States and China?
In the long run, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing, says experts.
This year's first warning was issued by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods arriving in the USA from China.
Each time Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike, and it does not look like the second economy in the world is about to give up.
Obstructing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but a public bow before the United States would be too embarrassing for China's president, Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic chaos in one country is, in fact, far more dangerous than the observers have ever admitted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding a country that has been ruined as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our territory is now more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
To restore normality, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met so that refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can return voluntarily.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept the conditional assistance offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, beating the US team with 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has already lost the sixth time in a row and since 1993 has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe regained its trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was not doing very well during most of the tournament, hit the football from the stand straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of the four players who since 1979, when it was the first time this tournament took place in the current format, managed to get a score of 5-0-0.
Jordan Spieth was eliminated by the lowest ranked player in Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest ranking in the world, lost two holes in front of the last hole with Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the highest number of victories in the Ryder Cup became the Spanish Sergio Garcia, who already took part in eight such tournaments and scored 25,5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to have the trophy back.
This is the success of the whole team, and I am happy to help," said touched Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He passes the baton to his fellow countryman, John Rahm, who beat a single American golf legend Tiger Woods in a game on Sunday, with a score of 2&1.
“I feel an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has scores 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unusual statistic, for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and only gave way to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been having trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance in the United States, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We've retreated.
Hats off before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than we did."
Information about the flower — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota the density of the plankton decreases
Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report shows an overall decline in plankton density in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of a speckled flower has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It stretches about 200 miles [209 km] of coastline from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The blooms can be found about 16 kilometres from the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The flower was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week there was an average concentration of plankton off the coast and in the waters of Pinellas County, low to medium off the coast of Hillsborough County, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high off the coast and Sarasota County, natural to medium in Charlotte County, natural to high off the coast and Lee County and low in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported.
Last week, however, they were not reported in northwest Florida.
