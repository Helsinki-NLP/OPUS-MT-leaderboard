Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
For his Masses to be freed and healed, the crowds are drawn.
He was several years old when things began to happen in his life that were inexplicable.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
For Masses celebrated by Fr Witko for the release and healing bring crowds
Once upon a time, the parents of a seven-month-old child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in her heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Astonished doctors said: "Operation is not needed, loss is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying out of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s spiritual remarkable actions began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I've lost human qualities and started to look like an animal," he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, couldn't get his voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"In the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form..." he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His calling was ripe.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted to talk more than just about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease participate in Masses about healing celebrated by Father Witko.
But the clergyman emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not fleshly healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th this afternoon) Kolping's FRAC team was well deserved by the current Polish champion Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
Jarosławs in such a personal ranking as they presented with the Grodziszczans, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
He clearly showed this duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called team leader Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps the Jaroslaws would reach out to him for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown up to compete with such players as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, i.e. Marek Badowski.
The Hellada player was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSIR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both in the fight with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three duels Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak, after an exciting five-hundred battle – Pavl Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
One could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There won't be any more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a free preventive research programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
In the explanatory memorandum, the agency explained that the target group had been wrongly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening difficulties in access to NFZ services and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive research results", it says.
The department's decision is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we anticipated it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then they'll go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it's about making it possible for people to prevent it more quickly.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps to detect diseases quickly and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand", said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that experts say, "Let's not get tested, because there will be longer queues at the doctor's, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that this is the state of health care," added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement about the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will arise, begins to implement this plan, we will cancel all the signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely", he threatened with Abbas' pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all of our rights with all possible means – not important what the consequences will be – by fully engaging in action for the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism", declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, after the elections of September 17, was again given the mission of forming a government.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements, which were sponsored by the United States.
84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold universal elections on Palestinian soils during the UN General Assembly session.
The last one was held in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and everyone who opposes them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community", declared the solemnly Palestinian President.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to exercise the powers of "full-fledged members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with all the United Nations provisions".
Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "will focus at the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership."
However, Danon, as the agencies note, did not refer to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
Paramedics want defibrillators at the critical points of Przemysl
The history of the border crossing shows that an AED automatic defibrillator can save lives.
The Provincial Emergency Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in sensitive points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicator Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing point in Medyka. A Customs and Tax Service officer noticed a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died of torture in custody.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the wife of an activist, called on September 23, the secretary of the communist party from her hometown to report that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognized.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement saying that her husband was sick and died of a “unfortunate accident”.
105 million PLN for video games companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Nearly PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of GameINN on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR was the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on an AR game engine that creates a real-world map with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test and training platform for the verification of practical skills at work and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of actual production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on virtual world interaction with the real-world concept of Industry 4.0 – reported in the NCBR release sent on Friday PAP.
The aim of the GameINN Sector Programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game industry is already growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and already reaching PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme provide an important boost for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev", reads the release.
The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for entrepreneurs to focus on innovation, such as R & D incentives, competence improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by the NCBR drive innovation activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market", says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Ministry of Science notes that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R & D relief in 2018 than a year before.
"The amount of the deducted costs for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN", emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous grant competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"It particularly welcomes the fact that the selected projects – as in previous editions – include projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment but also related to industry 4.0", he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and scientific units could apply for funding up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects received almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sectoral Programme is implemented under the Operational Programme Intelligent Development.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch.
The incident took place on September 16th.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any one, it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane didn't show up the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the start.
The players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, Diaby-Fadig finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money to the Dane for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old boy to make his debut in the first band three years later.
He played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the "L'Equipe" newspaper reported, the club is likely to solve it with immediate effect.
For now, he's initiated disciplinary action against his fighter.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
See if you're washing your hands right.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for the washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
Yet most of us wash them less!
All it takes is warm water and simple soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them against it).
By washing, we rub not only the bottoms and the tops of the hand, but also: finger tips (attached or individually) – rub them with circular motions on the inside of the second hand, spaces between fingers (stitch your hands, rubbing your fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb is covered with a second hand and in such a embrace we turn it a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you cannot wash your hands) we should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the hand-washed handles or doors (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
The President of Iran says he's turned down a proposal to talk to the US, Donald Trump denies it.
Tehran did not engage with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the Americans' offer to abolish sanctions, said Iran's President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that requested that the restrictions be lifted, which he refused to do.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed to abolish all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said that he had met with American diplomats because he had submitted to French, German, and Great Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the outcome will be," said Rowhani.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US, and that the European parties to the nuclear agreement accused American sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear agreement "are a precondition that does not allow" dialogue.
If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with the President of the United States Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the past week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the request of the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said "no!", tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with an atomic background agreement
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tension between Washington and Tehran in order to save some form the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It provided that in return for the abolition of economic sanctions Iran would resign from the nuclear programme and that the nuclear sector would be subject to control by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
It hasn't worked out so far.
Washington uses the tactics of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if it did not receive a licence to export raw material, it would limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in the stalling of judges, was restored on Wednesday to the ruling of the NSA.
Reason: no disciplinary action has been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not so far turned into an investigation against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who due to suspicion of participation in a hate group was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He claims there's no evidence of this except the fake screenshots and his wife he's divorcing.
That's exactly what the other judges who are connected to the caste say: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll be on their own.
Because the D.A.'s office didn't lift a finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, and it's silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June on another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of the people whom, as persecutors, Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out in a February report.
There is no proof – there is no case of Szmydt, there is no case of "Kasta".
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banasio about renting the tenement house to pimps and hiding income.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check when he does.
The Committee on Ethics will not deal with Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow gathered to make a curiosical decision to dismiss Banasian deputies and appoint his lawyer, although the law of such a bizarre combination does not foresee).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American novel, I think, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated that she can't say a word.
She's standing in the door, she's speechless, and at the same time, the lover jumps out of bed, dresses, and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and screams, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
It's just that there's a parody of the state in the case of Casta or Banasia.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the finals of the jump up
Previously returning this season to competition after the break of the mother's contestant, the bronze medalist of the world championship from London 2017, in the first attempt she defeated 1,85 and 1,89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 was not achieved until the third approach.
“I'm happy for you.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the finals I will have to jump better technically", she admitted in front of Eurosport Lićwinko.
In the eliminations the best were American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik – after 1.94.
Both contestants were the only ones who didn't knock down any heights.
The women's jump final is scheduled for Monday.

Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in severe condition
He went to the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
One must add that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that he will come out of it, that he will win again.
We all pray that he recovers", said an anonymous person close to Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with the journalists "Super Express".
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for Senate.
“My closest family and politics keep me alive,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview that he gave to journalists two weeks ago “Super Express”.
In January "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was sent to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for research.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father handed it over.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major surgery at the Ministry of Science and Technology Hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki told, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't think I'm metastasized.
I don't know if I'm going through chemo yet.
I turn myself in to medical professionals who are rather optimistic.
For now, after this difficult surgery, I need to get back to some sort of utility state.
I hope everything will be all right", said Kornel Morawiecki in January in an interview with "SE".
"If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this padole...", he added.

The power of lovable jumps.
The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon on 15 September on the hippodrome at Oleandra Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.
For to the true power the road is far away, but this is what one of the kinds of horse competition is called...
The jumping power competition is about the rider and horse overcoming ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.
It is worth noting that the long and still undefeated record of the world, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
No one jumped that high in Oława, of course, but the result of the best local amazons on the level of 135 cm also does not belong to the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "In the saddle" were a demonstration part of the "Terky equestrian competitions" which we describe more comprehensively in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons trained in horse riding in Oławski JKS entered the competition.
Four of them competed on the ponies and four on the big horses.
In the first group Nikola Szołdra, riding the crazy "Sprinter", did the best.
This small, yet dynamic rumac began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam removed from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals he was removed from the competition by the jury.
The second place in the ponies was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famas", and the third by Lena Borun on "Harmider".
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mares "Carmen".
Even greater emotions were accompanied by the starting amazons and viewers during the competition with the participation of large horses.
The terrible-looking falls were made by Paulina Szewczyk, who sat on the "Declarations" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the "Flying".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with introducing the young mares "Vinet" to the parker were caused by Veronica Łuczkiewicz.
It was either the coach's assistant, or another horse to the couple, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".
After passing the obstacle from the park, she also drove down full swing, so it was dangerous to sometimes in the stalls and in the expansion room. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a bit of scared viewers, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the big horse competition Marta Masalska has been doing great on the parker, sitting on the beautifully presented "Whisky".
This dignified mare, together with an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final stage as the first jumped 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at that moment.
However, after a while Paulina Szewczyk also placed the same height on "Declaration", Veronica Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka".
To decorate the flora and after receiving prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these contestants went together, and at the end together with the amazons on the ponies in Radecki's tact, they performed an impressive honor round, ending with these interesting and exciting competitions.

Max Kolonko is cut off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko himself could not even collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko tweeted that he had completed his cooperation with KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect my name to be removed from the name of the above mentioned KWW.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the above mentioned entity", he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.
For now it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, or whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4th, American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko in the USA, informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for running Max TV on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and in the world.
"We are tired of politicians, we are tired of your stupid games, we are tired of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," Kolonko said.
The party's agenda includes issues relating to the judiciary (should be elected in universal elections), tax changes (alignment of tax-free amounts for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to NATO's eastern flank states, with particular emphasis on Poland), referendum on arms ownership, reduction of the number of Members or the introduction of single-mandate constituency.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
But none of these coalitions finally happened.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium point
"The euro course will remain close to PLN 4.35, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets in the coming months", says Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy support the stabilisation of gold quotations at the current ceiling", says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are mitigating policy.
"As long as the gold is properly valued – the euro quotations should remain close to the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months – Polish bonds are not attractive in his opinion.
Much more profitable profitability than Polish securities offer bonds from emerging markets", says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets, accompanied by UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the economic downturn in the world.
"The global slowdown may get worse, but there should not be a severe recession, and at most a decline in GDP slightly below zero", says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should underestimate global actions that could be detrimental to the lack of prospects of resolving the trade conflict on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and brexit.
Among the equity markets, Europe should be relatively weak", according to the latest letter to investors by the head manager of UBS Wealth Management Marek Haefele.
"The shares in the euro area should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fear of slowing down", says the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of the German 10-year-old even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, the long-term viability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only in the short term, by mitigating the monetary policy of banks.
The largest area for foot reductions is the Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the coming years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is USD 1.29, which would mean 19% of the potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"To keep the dollar strong in the long term may not allow deficits in the current and budgetary accounts", says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehra is losing weapons.
Confidential report from the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 arms and 19 445 ammunition – according to a confidential list drawn up in the Ministry of Defence of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The press, belonging to the Press Group RedaktionsNewskerk Deutschland (RND), provided information.
According to a document from the Parliamentary Secretary of State's Office in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been retraced.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are six universal machine guns MG3, 11 automatic G3 rifles, four automatic G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
Also missing 30 barrels for machine guns MG3.
Mr Martin Renner, Vice-President of the Left Party, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told the RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “terrifying”.
All the more so, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that the list did not indicate whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the Act governing access to firearms.
An officer was accused of preparing assassinations against leading German politicians of extreme right-wing and racist motives.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecution, included, among others, the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas from the SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. has illegally taken possession of four firearms, over 1,000 ammunition and over 50 explosives.
Crying children on a plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines recently uses a function designed for those who find it a nightmare to travel with a crying child.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the timetable of seats on the aircraft.
If a minor travels through a given connection to the second year of life, the “child icon” appears on a specific, reserved seat by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the carrier’s services has the option to choose a place away from the one occupied by the child.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
A child icon will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.
As expected, the idea divided the netizens.
Some Twitter users suggest that travelling with crying children can be solved with earphones that reduce noise.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
"We must learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of sitting places for breathing mouths, drooling or drunks," wrote user G Sundar.
Another Internet user noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of support for the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook
Over 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
On Friday, Marc Pons, a representative of the Autonomous Government of the Balearic Islands, announced that among the 25 thousand holiday makers who would not be able to take their leave in Majorca on October, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of expected holidaymakers who had to give up their vacation in Majorca due to the bankruptcy of a British company next month are German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Island in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already started negotiations with international operators on "entering the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca", in October over 1000 people will lose their jobs due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are fired employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, the property owners demanded that guests pay an additional accommodation fee.
This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had ceased operations until at least the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the Friday daily Diario de Ibiza indicates that the majority of Ibiza hotels that have cooperated with the Thomas Cook group do not intend to close out in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this balearic island, a British bankrupt was co-operating with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, is located in Majorca.
According to the Balearic Government data, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of agreements for the period July-September 2019 around EUR 5 million.
Women's FIFA ranking.
Poland still at 29th place, USA at the head of
The women's representation of Poland occupies 29th place in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA), published on Friday.
In the same position the team of the trainer Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous July ranking.
Weak team games.
What's it gonna be like in October?
The leaders were American women who recently defended the title of world champion.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by the German women and the third was held by the Dutch women.
Polish women are preparing to qualify for ME.
They were supposed to start with an away match with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of opponents, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, Polish women will inaugurate their qualifications with a meeting with Spanish women on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, "White-Red" will play two social games – on October 3 with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
The Polish rivals are representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the groups and the three best teams from the second place will be promoted directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barracks for the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the FIFA ranking in September fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog has crushed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air programme are low, and coal furnaces will kick as if nothing had happened this winter", we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
"So far, 82 thousand applications have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme for funding of a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand decisions have been positive.
The accepted applications amount to over PLN 915 million", says "Rz", referring to data from the spokesman of the Minister of the Environment.
According to the newspaper, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced noisy program are described as "moderate".
Local government officials, quoted by the "Rz", look at the failure of the "Clean Air" among others in too big bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible random execution checks.
This would improve the operation", says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation less than 1% of the intended purpose of replacing 3 million mounding boilers was realized.
According to „Rz”, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. annually PLN 10 billion, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, only PLN 1.4 billion was reserved for this year", we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work", wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price", added the Polish Minister.
Agreement for Polish F-35
The Polish air force is to power 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The Communication stresses that the investment will support national security and the foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department's information, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department pointed out that the contract would also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics support and programme and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 Fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine multi-purpose fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombardment and typically hunting tasks of air combat.
By using stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radar.
Recently, F-35 fighters purchased Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16.
The purchase of American combat aircraft is also to be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie manufacturer has launched a series of sexually neutral dolls.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer has launched a series of sexually neutral dolls
Next to Barbie with different skin colors, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced a gender-neutral doll to the market.
"Creatable World" toys wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie has short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys with girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
The emphasis on sexual characteristics was also abandoned – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a thin waist or, in the case of Ken, wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have imposed sexual standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a particular gender inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
Barbie's doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high-heeled shoes, has been criticised many times in the past for promoting "unhealthy women's stereotypes", such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The company responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: Circle or Club Together can have several Members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which candidates for the SLD, Spring and Left-wing Parliament together, running with the common logo "Levice"), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by hope that the Left is not only right, but also has strength," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 Members.
"This may mean that a circle or club together will have several Members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how it's gonna happen," he said.
When asked if the Left Together would have a separate wheel, Zandberg replied: “We are set to be diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by Poles, because we showed that we were able to agree on a common programme when we differed".
When asked whether the largest beneficiary of the joint start was the leader of the SLD Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he considered the largest beneficiaries to be the centreleft and left-wing voters.
In turn to note that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that "the goal of the political party is to represent its constituents".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer, to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further," he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th Senate district, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district", he emphasized the politician.
"I don't think I'd be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate)", he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski the leader of Polish Citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are taking part.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa was opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by bus, car and foot to Bopp, where there was a new mosque, which could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The facility was built by the Mouride fraternity, belonging to the Sufi Islamic movement, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, which was handed over by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan (the Paths to Paradise) comes from the poem of Sheik Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th century founder of the brotherhood, worshiped by the followers as a saint.
The mosque has five minarets.
The tall man is 78 meters tall.
The mosque in the middle holds 15,000 believers, and the other one can be on the outside stage.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, gigantic chandeliers and hand-made decorations by Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison between the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 believers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed by private donations.
In addition to the land, the government has provided lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but we ourselves
A pass of eight league games without winning the Crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the extraclass of Silesia.
"Our problem is not the reoccurrence, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we play", stressed Kieelczan Mirosław Smyła.
Footballers of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first line, when on the departure they defeated 1:0 Beniminka of the Raków Częstochowa competitions.
Later, the Kielczańskis recorded two draws and six losses, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 finals of the Polish Cup.
"I am optimistic that in the final seconds of the cup game the footballers were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the lawn after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, it was the fall of anger, because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play", added the trainer.
During the Friday match in the Crown, there will certainly not be a pause for the excess yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, and there will also be no injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
On the other hand, the builder is to report to the cup match of several players eager to play.
"We have a headache, recently it seemed that he would be gone, and now he is," said Smyła.
The Crown Defender Daniel Weirdel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league games in a row without winning, while in the extraclass anyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the field, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday", said the footballer.
After nine rounds of extra-class Crown with five points, it takes 15th position.
Silesia has gathered 12 more and ranks second.
The Friday match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe.
"42 percent of the species of trees forming the state of Europe are at risk", warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.
The list is headed by chestnuts and raspberries.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by experts who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees present in Europe (and also elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly threatened".
Among the causes of this is the rapid expansion of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
In terms of typical European stands, according to IUCN specialists 58 percent of species are threatened and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the exploitation of the stands, accelerated urbanisation, too intensive logging, and subsequent forest fires and changes in the European ecostism.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also severely threatened.
"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of species of European plants and create the risk of the extinction of important and underrated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet", concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+
"Today, the Law and Justice Party wants to bribe Poles, offering them for freedom of distribution on credit, which will have to pay for future generations", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole policy of the Law and Justice Party is a pic".
At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken".
Schetyna assures Jack Nizinkiewicz that she has an idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than the Kaczyński party.
"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than supporters of the Law and Justice Party, a party who has been mistrusting the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.
The Leader of the Civil Coalition and the Chairman of the Civic Platform also pointed out the basic principles of the KO's electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing that data will be taken away, but we need to set a direction for the future, because the Law and Justice Office deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments", he said.
Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurial".
Schetyna explains that the program includes, among others, a project which will give the least earners more about PLN 614 per hand and more for earners – also several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for publishing.
Like he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid against the opposition for publishing, until the financial collapse of the country took place," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Pride walks before a fall.
Kaczyński is a statesman like Banas is crystal", he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether or not to apply for the Leadership of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Great Condors Dead
Six large condors were found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large Condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes, and wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten toxic carcass.
Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
"This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we're losing a protected species, a endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, Argentina's environmental protection organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health", he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun to grant the head of the state a precious chain.
Andrzej Duda's law firm supported the idea – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".
According to the newspaper, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignium officially called during the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can reach the arms of Andrzej Duda.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Law and Petitions voted on the proposal to undertake work on the amendment of the Act on Orders and Awards in order to restore it.
The journal says that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of the state.
The Senate has already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it has disappeared with one voice.
This time, the work is fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, considering that they would be consulted by the President's Chancellery.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition", wrote then the President's Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday the case was continued by the Senate Committee and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The Chancellery of the President answered briefly: she is in favour of bringing it back," said committee chief Robert Mamątow of the Law and Justice Party, quoted by "Rz".
He submitted a request for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Al. Ciepliński and Al. Piłsudski.
Uniform activities are related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, the police are starting preventive action in Rzeszów "Modern Crossroads".
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of sliding, not complying with traffic signals or traffic signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and we are really making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, Vice President of the city a few days ago.
His words were given at the City Hall press conference, where the city authorities presented examples of inadequate traffic at the intersections, resulting in traffic jams.
At that time the president appealed to travellers for reasonableness on the road and, among other things, faster moving on the lights or not writing text messages while driving.
The topic was taken over by the mass police, who are starting from today's action "Modern Crossroads".
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of congestion at crossings by drivers entering them without the possibility to continue driving.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to increasing traffic and traffic congestion.
It is at risk of a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to failure to comply with traffic signals or traffic signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late departure from the signals, slow crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At which intersections will the activities be carried out?
Among others, Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Street from Piłsudski Avenue; Targowa Street from Piłsudski Street; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw Uprising Street.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be carried out on the next Fridays of October.
They've checked the waste disposal company from Chaika.
"On Friday, officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the County of Wołomiński and the Regional Construction Supervision Inspectorate checked the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka" in Warsaw is disposed of", said Karol Szyszko, spokesman of the old-age of Wołomiński.
Inspectors from the old Volomina period carried out an inspection at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The Private Trade and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under the contract with the capital sewage treatment plant "Czajka" provides waste management services.
"The installation was inspected and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business", said Szyszko.
He added that the audit report would be sent, among others, to the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw during the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out samples, measurements and tests of groundwater and did not have the results of the tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant.
After inspection of the Visitor Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste in the excavation site, waste of up to 60 000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Waterworks and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 the plant was decommissioned.This was due to damage to one of the incinerators.
According to the MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walesa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” said Lech Wałęsa to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me", replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now "just a retired fan".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Walesa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk on Friday.
The son of Wałęsa – Jarosław – took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You took on a difficult task," said Lech Walesa after the meeting.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, the great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible", said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and know how important it is," she said.
"Let us show that we can do another, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
You did so with your revolution, and so we want to change Poland", emphasized Kidawa-Błońska.
Retired fan
Wałęsa, in an interview with journalists, said that he is now "just a retired fan".
"Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The tri-division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this needs to be cleaned up, all of this needs to be brought back to normal, and I believe that this time we will.
Because if not, we are facing a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
“That is why it is so important that Poles go to the elections, think and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing," added Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that with a card we will improve the state of affairs as it is in Poland", the former president replied.
"We need to build a new foundation"
When asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the three divisions of power do not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we need to go back to the beginning and make it clear that Poland will not go any further."
ME volleyball players: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
In the hot area in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European championship.

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment the Act on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important government officials and on flights of the most important persons in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Act on the property of families of civil servants without amendments, 14 were against and three abstained.
The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to "civilise" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of the own children, the children of the spouse, the children adopted to cases where the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the declaration.
The Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important government officials, whose project was created at the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, Members, MEPs, senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the heads of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the statement of property information on the personal assets of spouses, children and persons who remain in a common life.
The Senate did not propose amendments to the Act on flights of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important people in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted in favour of the bill, 12 were against and four abstained.
According to the bill, every flight of the president will be a flight "executed on official mission".
The president's flights will be accompanied by family members and others invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight in the mission of the official Prime Minister and Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight "taken in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board – invited Members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; technical, medical or organisational staff; as well as journalists.
In accordance with the Act, in the event of doubts concerning the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the Head of the National Council will ask for their clarification.
If such doubts are not resolved within the prescribed time limit, the Head of the NAP will be obliged to notify the Heads of the Sejm or the Senate of the impossibility of organising such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, Poles are waiting for their last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where on Saturday they will perform for the bronze medal.
Vital Heynen's protégés closed Thursday's defeat with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their trouble with the trip to this duel.
This time there were no such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians to Paris, and a few hours later they took training in the famous Berca hall.
According to the report of those present in the class, the trainer of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the exercise of volleyball elements.
"We went to the hall, but it was definitely the time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team", he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to earth.
No doubt we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to that game.
We talked about this game between the two of us at the staff, coach talked a lot with the players.
As two main causes of failure, I would point to ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situation balls.
The Slovenians were much better in this respect than we were", he analyzed.
In his opinion, "White-Red" did not interfere with the stress associated with the performance against the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament co-hosts.
He admitted that the world champions might have put down a smooth path to the semifinals.
"Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group phase, we would have studied the lesson more quickly and would have played differently later on in the tournament.
But it's only a guess," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat will turn Poles into aggression in a bronze match.
"I hope that then we will show our true face.
There's something to fight about.
Recently we won the ME medal in 2011", he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
During the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group phase they went to Apeldoorn and moved to Ljubljana to the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on take-offs and a fine of $25,000 – in a six-month suspension – for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
A summary of the offences of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a wayward athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been upsetting for a long time and has earned a specific tennis record in the world – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and the spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chachanov – all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019 he did not play long either, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the above-mentioned verdict about the suspension of the start and the next fine.
But the words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the guilty one and learning the context of the speech.
However, in the explanatory memorandum, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour for the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence the high punishment.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering several conditions to be fulfilled in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and the ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of the existing professional tennis players, in particular, he must no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, nor behave indecently and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specialising in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have a break of at least two weeks, as his shoulder injury worsened in the Lavera Cup, so he had to give up his next start in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP ranking Kyrgios ranks 27th.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines, he will have a lot left.
Central Statistical Office: Poland is living better and better
According to a report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday, 44 percent of them were assessed as good or rather good in their material situation in the last year.
The year before was 37.2%, in 2016, 33.5%, and in 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of self-employed households is best.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the other pole there are pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.
The worst is single parenting, of which 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among non-childless households is 48.8%.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by single parents and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of a rapid increase in income, mainly from work.
However, that is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link at the level of voivodships between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by inhabitants of the Opole province, where 48.9 percent of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are further Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average in last year and 98% in Lubusek.
The highest income was obtained by residents of Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
On average, in Poland, the disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, this is quite a low result.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187 in the last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased in real terms by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crews
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, reported the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, five crew members of this ship have been killed in total.
The previous suicide took place in July this year, and the previous in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each event occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was mooring off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, death is not to be linked.
"We need everyone to be involved in making suggestions and ideas about how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions related to the search for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, ship commander, on Facebook.
Niesiołowski critically about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiolowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"Actually, every sentence he made was accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way in the life of Pope Polak", he explained.
Former PO politician admitted: “There was a murmur of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept it, but he had power and for politicalism he could just throw it out of the Church or send it on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, similarly his successor", explained Niesiolowski.
"Besides, this fatal matter of paedophilia and the activities of the Church, or, in fact, their absence, has come.
I ran a little bit ahead of myself, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been known recently.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters", he says in an interview with journalist Niesiolowski.
In the opinion of the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice.
"It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, all the crosses hanging.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will be paid dearly", argued Niesiolowski.
"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind", he concluded.

Disqualified griffin
The Polish Cup match between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk almost ended tragically when the goalkeeper Zlatan Alomerović, fired by fans from Wejherów by millimeter, passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the season 2020/2021.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to go to league matches by 31 December.
Burdy at the stadium Widzewa Łódź was also hailed by fans of Silesia Wrocław.
Here, however, the verdict of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Nevertheless, the service allowed the Łódź sector to be thrown at by ragami fans, burning chairs and pushing the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next game in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and next edition of PP.
Extraclasses league games were also banned, but there they will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange labelling throughout the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszow
In Podkarpacie the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the recording of names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship changes will be made on 94 road signs set up on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, more readable and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of villages in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in law prepared by us, they will finally appear on the signs by our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway", informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie the changes will be made on 94 road signs set up on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of the investment?
200,000 PLN.
As a first step, the new labelling will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
So what's the idea going to look like?
It'll be done without changing the plates, on a stick-in-the-box basis.
They will replace the existing names of the localities, written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will make it much easier for people who do not know the spelling of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan with a gun.
In Zameczno pond in Lower Silesia, inhabitants noticed swans having problems with wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had made a target of the animal – in his body a shotgun shot was found.
"He received information about the wounded bird from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sól.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We're on our way.
It was obvious that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and to put him under additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone made a target out of him.
In his body there were shards of sharps", says Marcin Walasek, CEO of Malpol, which manages, among others, the rehabilitation centre.
He's wintering at the resort.
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort, where he will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
Letting him go now would mean that he probably wouldn't survive the winter," adds Walasek.
The staff after undergoing rehabilitation will release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after receiving information on the reason for the poor health of the animal, intend to inform the prosecution of the case.
The incident occurred in Zameczno
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish small trade"
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to be considered whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
During the conversation in Radio One, Gowin said that the trade is controlled by international networks which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
The Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the Law and Justice Government tried to deal with this at the very beginning of the term of office, but he was given a "contra on the part of the EC".
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and formulates the government, we will return to this topic," he said.
At the same time he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade".
"Over this we will have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Gowin.
In May, the EU Court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in considering that the Polish retail tax was not allowed public aid.
The Retail Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC opened an infringement procedure for EU law by Poland.
At the time, Brussels argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered State aid.
It further concluded that the tribute had been unlawfully implemented.
It also issued a suspension order pending its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The decision of the EU Court of Justice in May opened the way for the reintroducement of the tax, but it did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal at the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the EUSEU informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure will begin, namely hearing the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good few to several months from the appeal to the delivery of the judgment.
"This procedure lasts an average of one year", said PAP source at the Court of Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
Often, it is the first time the whole family is focused around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.
Little wonder, then, that the newly baked mother and father want their comfort to be as good as possible on that day.
But before you make a final decision about the baby’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In shops you can find many costume sets that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a dress for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, a few weeks ago, little ones were baptized, dressed in white sets, and put into the same beiges or big pillows.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: a few months, a year or even bigger.
It is easy to know that such a great comfort needs a slightly different dress for baptism.
So if your child is three to four months old on the day of baptism, he may be in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or godparents.
The best way to do this is to decorate it with comfortable cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this garment is considered to be a everyday garment, it is enough to search for its festive variants, such as frills or lace.
For the boy, the body with the print of bow ties and braces will be perfect.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have a bigger fantasy of dress.
The girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress.
Many of the girls’ parents are eagerly looking towards richly decorated, fabled dresses for baptism in a set of coats, bands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, breathless materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of suitable clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and charming sets will make your daughter look lovely and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys’ parents had a fashion for suits that were a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or helmets often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their displeasure.
Today, fortunately, they have been pushed out by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft sweatpants, and a blouse decorated at the front with a vest pattern.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not hinder the movements of the knowledgeable world of the little one.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a statement of property
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a statement of property at the end of her term of office.
It shows that the Member of the Law and Justice Party collected 110 thousand PLN of savings.
Let us remind you that Pavlovich announced that she had resigned from politics.
In the end of the term of office, he has PLN 110 thousand.
According to the statement made by the Member, she receives a monthly pension worth PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and slightly smaller, which he rents, collecting PLN 880 per month.
The messenger also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150 thousand.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a statement of property.
Voting on a break during the Conservative Party conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons during the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, as requested by the government.
289 Members voted against – 306.
It is customary that the House of Commons does not meet at party conferences so that Members do not have to give up either their participation in them or their parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK's exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
There were 289 Members in favour of the government's request for a break, and there were 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The refusal to allow a recess may be regarded as a political revenge against the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared by the Supreme Court to be illegal and unconscionable) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the ruling of the judges.
After this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing turbulent debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brexit and avoiding early elections.
"It's time to make a brexit happen.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," said Johnson.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups - Labour Party and Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.
One of the justifications Johnson gave to explain such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders", writes foreign media.
The President's spokesman has definitely denied these reports.
"It's just not true," wrote Błażej Skuszalski on Twitter.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", say that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish Consulate in New York, declared that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned an act of aggression against the Polish ambassador in Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Polish, Polish".
‘The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he tweeted Błażej Skuszalski.
He emphasized that Duda "has never said that Israel is responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski, the portal "it was invented".
According to the interviewers, "JI" during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that Jews from Israel "such as Israel Kac" are responsible for the increase in anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg’s statement was to be interrupted.
Who's Banas and what's his fault?
Rented by the tenants of the tenement house led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We're summing up another scandal that shook up the ruling camp.
Journalists of TVN “Superwizjier” revealed that Marian Banas, President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not in recent years entered a 400-metre-long tenement house in Kraków's Podgórze.
Moreover, his sub-renter was to run sex business in the mentioned tenement house (and so rent rooms per hour).
On the other hand, the building itself has allegedly been a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the Superviser program.
The journalist revealed that Banasia's tenement house was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use as a place of “erotic meetings”.
The clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
Banas's charges were ambiguity and murky.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The tenement itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rent was to be understated.
“Mariań Banas and his wife could be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia townhouse itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently carrying out an audit of Marian Banasia's property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banaś announced that until its completion he would suspend his activities in NIK. "I will address your marshal for a free leave", he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
"We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or speed up the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.
That is why we are forced to perform the task of the state authorities and to notify them of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said Mariusz Witczak, PO-KO.
"If a normal Pole so grossly low-valued the rental of his property, he would already have 10 controls, tax increases and criminal-tax proceedings", he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Audit Office.
He was appointed to this post on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term of office.
His candidacy was tabled by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party accepted.

"Rzeczpospolita": To ignore a police officer's orders will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a specific conduct order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by fines, arrests, or restrictions on freedom.
The police unionists want to make this change.
The idea went to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases are sent to Polish courts", we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" established that the petition, which the Independent Police Association writes to Members on the amendment of the Code of Offences, has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offence.
It would read: "Whoever does not submit to the demand or order of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be subject to imprisonment, fine or restriction of freedom".
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who do not follow orders, prevent or impede the performance of a business activity", states the journal.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita", that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political matters of manifestation.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations it would be unfavourable and instead of mitigating the situation, it would even exacerbate it", he adds.
The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens positively evaluated police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol's writing is in his blood.
His ancestors include editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important postwar Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
Thus, Jáchym was under the curse of talent that he was trying to use from the beginning.
After eight years, he came back with "The Sensitive Man."
The heroes are Buras and Soňa together with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They're wandering actors, traveling around Europe.
He's Shakespeare's lover and thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys did not make a sound from birth, and for the other time stopped in infant times.
But it's not the heroes that's the most important thing in this story.
They are all just backgrounds for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of flealand, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
"Susceptible man" turns into an absurd play in some places.
Narration mimics didaskalia, and the talk of heroes creates this world.
The stage is a Europe full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies, Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of the British company's mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that the customers who bought the trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agents in the world – declared bankruptcy on Sunday night on Monday.
The immediate cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of the last chance talks on Sunday with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan already agreed on in August, the company would obtain an additional €200 million as a guarantee for the winter period, when travel agents usually had a lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer has been prepared for German visitors Görlitz.
Actions are intended to help fight the steady decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost town in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as the Guardian writes, the city is facing significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also suffers from a steady loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a decrease in the population of the city by 25%.
In 2013, it amounted to 54 000 people.
To fight the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.
Two thirds of them were made up of the inhabitants of large cities.
The programme was also attended by people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to get the opinion of the programme participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move – about what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
