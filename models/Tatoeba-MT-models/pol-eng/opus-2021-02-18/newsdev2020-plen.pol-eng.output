Bosnians protest against Croatia's plans for a radioactive waste dump
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-western Bosnia in protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in Bosnian town of Novi Grad demanded that Croatia reject plans to build a landfill in former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared their fight against the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosnians holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us", said that a landfill of radioactive waste could threaten the Unia River and the lives of about 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say no,
said Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
The Krško plant located in Slovenia, built in the 1980s, is also owned by Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are due to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided whether to build a landfill on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find a different location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why does Croatia, across its territory, say that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?” asked Drljaca.
We can't let them humiliate us!

Among the entities that will be able to submit candidates for committee members are: the Supreme Bar Council, the National Council of Legal Advisers, the National Judicial Council, the National Council of Prosecutors, the Chief Medical Chamber, the National Chamber of Psychologists and non-governmental organisations whose statutory tasks included activities related to children's rights for at least two years, in particular those related to the protection and prevention of violence, including sexual violence.

The American Congress has agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The U.S. Congress, 15 days after the State Department approved the possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-purpose F-35 fighters, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
“After the State Department has approved the sale, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles,” said John V. Venable, Senior Counsel for Washington Defence Policy, conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of weapons abroad 15 days before the signing of the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of weapons to the NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if the transaction is finalized – will be the American defense company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A fighters by Pratt and Whitney.
In May, the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak proposed the purchase of American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during a meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalised, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon within the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland's offer of purchase was – without arms and technical assistance – about $89.2 million.
As the US military experts who wanted to remain anonymous told PAP, this price in the initial negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"Prices are dropping sharply, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than the cost of Eurofighter, which does not have the same advantages as the F-35", Venable pointed out.
The PAP speakers expressed their hope that the final negotiations on Poland's purchase of American fighter aircraft would end this year.
The potential participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – or offset – will be discussed directly with American manufacturers of F-35 fighters.
What is Münchhausen's replacement team mentioned in the "Payton Hobart's Choices" on Netflix?
The caregivers and parents with the above disorders pretend that their healthy child eats sick.
"Payton Hobart's Choices" will be on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States of America, but first he has to be president of student self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's show, the creators of American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had a chance to see the show, it addresses the subject of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome – mental illness in caregivers who act as if a healthy person who has been affected by physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. Münchhausen syndrome, which causes symptoms of the disease.
Münchhausen's replacement syndrome consists in simulating that the person under our care has certain ailments.
It is also called an imaginary and induced disease, and is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent who exaggerates symptoms or causes symptoms to make it look like his child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen replacement syndrome?
Symptoms of this disease may vary, but the NHS draws attention to the following examples:
Convincing medical staff that a child who looks healthy is not feeling well.
Exaggerating or inventing symptoms.
Counterfeiting the results to make a child sick, e.g. giving glucose to urine samples to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Cause symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often does Münchhausen’s replacement syndrome occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of the disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that over two years there were 89 cases of this disorder in 100,000 people.
What should be done if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?
Please contact the local branch of special services or call the NSPCC Children's Helpline by dialing 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid on a school in Kaduna, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – Kaduna State Police Station raided the school of Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma in Rigas, Igabi Local Government Area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were under highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities denied that claim.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a minister at school, said: “They are not telling the truth, because all the children were there with the consent of their parents.
My parents signed the form before they were admitted to school.
Every day, parents brought food to their children and knew what the conditions were.
We were very surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of all the food provided by the parents before the school was closed.
It's not fair, because parents can testify that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check on the level of childcare, had never had reservations.
He said that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, public relations police officer Yakubu Sabo thought that after the transfer of children to the state government, they would join their parents.
‘They were held in dehumanising conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of kranical knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
Therefore, we study the school to meet its owner", he added.
Foreign talent important for China's development
Guangdong is the country's leader in attracting foreign talents largely due to the Belt and Trail Initiative (BRI), the Gulf Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.
The Nanfang Media Group interviewed seven expatriates between the ages of 10 and 70 in Guangdong.
From Singapore, Yash, born in 2010, said that he would like to pursue his dream of becoming a scientist and a doctorate in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrow, a Russian-Chinese university student at Shenzhen MSU-BIT, said: “With the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
Together we can create new concepts and new ventures.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the United States started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over a million fans on Bibilibili and Weibo.
She said that in her videos she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI centres in Guangzhou, agrees that “children’s education is like wearing a jacket.
If you incorrectly fasten the first button, the rest of you will never get to the right place.
An American of Chinese origin Henry Xiao believes that in the very centre of the GBA area his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The producer of the culinary program “Nanta Show” Sean Choi from South Korea said that the Guangdong region's cuisine is known worldwide and the introduction of “Nanta Show” in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland, who works as Technical Director for Quality at Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality lies in the proper performance of simple works.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products and persistently strive for better results.

The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.
How to become an influencer?
Alisha Marie revealed a few tricks.
Alisha created her YouTube channel in 2008.
Its activities are observed by over 8 million subscribers.
Among other things, she provides advice on fashion and beauty, and promotes the idea of DIY, which is "do it yourself".
So far, she has worked with companies such as BMW or Starbucks.
Alisha Marie interviewed Business Insider.
She gave a few tips to people who want to start working with brands, e.g. on Instagram.
She stressed that companies must not wait until they see the potential of a particular person, and that they should take the initiative.
Alisha Marie says that when you try to make contact with the brand, there are simple messages.
The interest in the company and the desire to be its ambassador must be demonstrated.
What did Alisha write when she applied for her first co-operation with brands?
"I like your stuff.
Let me know if you are ever interested in cooperation" – she sent a message about this content as a beginner influencer. "It was not professional, but it was mine," she said.
Alisha pointed out that the first step that the representatives of the brand will take will be to enter the profile of the person who is applying for cooperation. "The climate that will feel at the beginning will probably be a breakthrough", she said.
Alisha therefore convinces to think about her profile on Instagram, for example, as a portfolio.
They will include content that may potentially be of interest to various companies.

We are thrilled to be able to cooperate with Mohegan Sun Pocono and proud to welcome the patrons of our new sports betting center and offer a wonderful extension of our online product in one of the major states that regulates both sports betting and casino.
We wanted a strong partner who shares our commitment to providing customer experience and sharing our values.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be President
"I think Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda", says Tomasz Siemoniak.
Deputy Head of the Civic Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in an interview with Polsat News spoke about a scandal involving the head of the NIK.
“This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become a minister of culture from some entertainment business, not the head of the NIK or the finance minister.
Not someone who's responsible for billions, taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis", he added.
Siemoniak also talked about the candidacy of Klauda Jachira.
“Antoni Macierewicz is on the list of the Law and Justice.
A man who didn't just say things, he did them.
He tried ex-heads of the Home Army to spy on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why does no one call for Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the list?", asked.
"People younger than us have different aesthetics.
I think that Jachir, who has already apologized for one of the things, also feels that sometimes she's overreacting.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.
Tourists after the collapse of the travel agency Neckermann Poland will return to the country
According to the government, it was not necessary to bring tourists before the time.
‘The Authority is gradually paying off unpaid hotel seats from the insurance guarantee’, stated.
On 25 September, the travel agency Neckermann Poland made a declaration of insolvency at the Marshal's office.
At the time the office made a declaration of insolvency, there were 3600 tourists abroad.
On Wednesday a group of about 500 people returned to Poland, and on Thursday 230.
Another 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece are due to return on Friday.
Tourists will fly to Katowice and Warsaw (five charter flights in total).
Some of them will return by cruise.
On the weekend – as planned – approx. 1000 tourists staying on holiday should return to the country, among others, in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy.
According to information provided by the Marshal's Office of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, the travel agency sold about 20 thousand trips for the autumn-winter season.
"These travel agents' customers should contact the insurer directly – Allianz Partners", reminded the office.
He also added that "the situation of tourists who signaled problems in hotels at the moment seems to be stable, and the emerging incidents of inviting tourists from hotels have been managed together with the consular services".
Last Friday, the authorities of the largest and oldest travel agency Thomas Cook reported that it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100 percent of the shares in Neckermann Polska.
"Sleazy" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a cloaking suit, a man grabbed a 12-year-old girl heading for school from behind and dragged her into a thick brush in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was issued at his home, where the officers detained a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man confessed to seven charges of assault and to three more charges of seduction and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim was walking along the path, and when she looked back, she saw him suddenly come out of the bushes armed with a big branch and a knife.
When she begged, "Stop, stop, stop," she grabbed her neck and forced her to go into the bush.
The man said: “Quiet, don’t shout.
Don't shout, or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in her right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable bands, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9.30 p.m., without answering a few texts and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and she was wearing traces of grass and trees, and he himself claimed to have been involved in an accident involving an attack of rage on the road during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the embankment.
The man's conviction will continue on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement is a danger of increasing social inequalities if the common good is not taken into account from an ethical point of view.
Pope Francis gave these words at a conference in the Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of dormitories and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
Technology achievements in the field of war art and the future of work were discussed, in which machines will play an increasingly important role, as well as a case study of the Christchurch bombing in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies that own social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that the machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that the increasing dependence on robotic devices to make profits was the risk of depriving people of their dignity as a result of their work.
"If technological progress were to result in increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress", he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to undesirable retroception of some kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
The organizers of the conference expressed their hope of taking advantage of the participants' expertise and identifying possible future advisors of the Catholic Church in matters related to high technologies.
Martin Odegaard, a loaned player from Real Madrid, puts fans in a euphoria with his impressive assistance.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assist with the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabal.
By winning 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed the top of the La League table and continued its streak of undefeated on its own field this year.
However, despite the failure of one failure this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, there is great pressure from the turbulent pre-season period and the public quarrel with the Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached the boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedane Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal – for some of them the French currently have plans, for others they do not.
Vinícius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the band.
However, it was the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, who caused a great stir, including an incredible assist in the La League game.
During the meeting Real Sociedad from Alaves, Martin Odegaard made an impressive assist with the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 in front of his own audience.
After receiving the ball from the right hand side, Martin Odegaard manoeuvred the player from the opposing team, setting up a net for him, and then sent an amazing pass per centimeter between the other two players and his teammate only left to add a leg.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty throw, ensured a decisive victory for Imanol's subjects before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid just as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of his fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel confident on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of the name of Sharad Pawar on the fraud concerning the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra
Anna Hazare said: “The name of Sharad Pawar was not on the list when I was handed over the case.”
The social activist, Anna Hazare, was not surprised by the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar, president of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with a multimillion-dollar fraud at the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank.
Investigative Agency of Executive Directors, in short ED, brought a case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar – former Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra – and others in connection with fraud.
The Executive Director's information report on the case, the equivalent of the FIR police report, was submitted by the central agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The basis of the case is the FIR report of the Mumbai police, which lists the names of the former bank president, Ajit Pawar, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, the name of Sharad Pawar was nowhere to be seen.
"How did his name come up, who gave it, only they know these things," said Anna Hazare on Thursday, when he was asked about the case of ED and the alleged connection of Sharad Pawar to the fraud.
Anna Hazare, critically evaluating Sharad Pawar, expressed the hope that the truth would be revealed as a result of a thorough investigation of fraud conducted by the ED.
“ED will know where his name came from,” said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the protest against corruption.
Sharad Pawar contradicts the criminal act and claims that he was not in any way connected to the bank and also calls into question the fact that the case was filed a few weeks before the elections of the Maharashta Assembly scheduled for October 21.
The former Minister of the Union assured that he would not submit to the majesty of Delhi, explicitly referring to the central government led by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the matter of the Executive Director as politically motivated.
It's a busy day, SG.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to transport stolen items worth over PLN 130,000 to Ukraine.
All events were recorded yesterday (September 26) in the direction of departure from Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen carried a specialized electric bicycle.
When determining the legality of the origin of the item, the SG officers contacted representatives of the German Police and quickly determined that a modern single-track worth about PLN 10 thousand was stolen in the territory of the country.
A few hours later also in Korczowa, border guards controlling a semi-trailer registered in France found interference in the VIN number field.
The driver of the trucking kit was a Ukrainian citizen.
The semi-trailer worth about PLN 30 thousand has been stopped and will be subjected to detailed expertise in order to establish the original data.
On the other hand, at the Medica border crossing, SG officers foiled the attempt to export another stolen Can-am quad (Prod. 2019).
The value of the vehicle transported on the tow truck was estimated at 75 thousand PLN.
The driver of the set was a 32-year-old Ukrainian citizen.
Border Guard confirmed that only two weeks ago the quad was lost in Poland and is wanted throughout Europe.
A "partial" attempt to export a stolen vehicle was also thwarted in Medica.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian bus driver carried body parts from an exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were removed mechanically.
The body elements worth about 15 thousand zlotys have been stopped.

Mylan agrees to pay $30 million as part of the EpiPen settlement
Mylan agreed to pay $30 million as part of an agreement relating to the failure to notify investors of an investigation by the Department of Justice regarding a possible request for too high an amount in the Medicaid programme for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission stated on Friday that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen for "generic" medicines in the Medicaid reimbursement program.
Therefore, the pharmaceutical company provided the government with a significantly lower return on the part of the product price than when EpiPen was classified as a ‘brand’ medicine.
In July, Mylan disclosed that it had reached agreement on the principles of the KPWiG.
In its Friday statement, the company stated that it did not confirm or deny the allegations of KPWiG.
Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, child death.
These are dramas that cause a great deal of suffering and are difficult to understand.
We say, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that “God wanted so.”
Is it the Creator who sends us misery and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the room terrifiedly.
"My son has no arms or legs!" he shouted to the doctor.
Parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick’s mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is a world famous evangelizer and motivational speaker who converts many people.
“I am proof that God is never wrong,” Nick emphasizes.
“When suffering affects us, it’s hard to understand.
We're looking for a reason.
We ask: «Why did this happen to us?».
If we believe that God is in control of the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises, whether it was He who sent us the disease, the calamity...".
Mother confesses to the murder of two teenage sons
The woman burst into tears when she was told that she could spend the rest of her life in prison after she confessed to murdering two of her teenage sons and planning to kill the other four of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35, confessed to the murder of Tristan Barrass (13 years) and Blake Barrass (14 years).
The death of the brothers occurred in a hospital 12 minutes apart after police were called to Shiregreen, South Yorkshire, on May 24, 7:30.
The autopsy was performed, but the autopsy results were not reported at the Sheffield Crown Court on Friday.
The exact circumstances of the boys' death are not yet known.
Barrass appeared on the bench with the defendant Brandon Machine, 39 years old, a family member.
Surrounded by three guards, they confessed to two counts of murder and one charge of planning the murder of six children.
During the 20-minute hearing, the couple also confessed to five counts of attempted murder.
The charge of murder planning refers to the period between 14 and 20 May.
Four of the charges of attempted murder on 23 May involve four children, including Blake and Tristan.
The fifth attempted murder took place on May 24th.
All of the surviving children are under 13 years old.
The Queen’s counselor, Judge Jeremy Richardson, told the couple: “I will never fully be able to express in words how shameful you have done.
Your crimes speak for themselves.
Murder of two children.

Sentence will be given on November 12th.
PO Member Krzysztof Brejza is suing Cezary Gmyz
"In connection with the campaign of lies written by TV, I appear with a lawsuit against Cezary Gmyz", said Krzysztof Brejza on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is the statement of a publicist named Cezary Gmyz on TVP's TV show "It's past 20".
One of the leading leaders of SokemzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has extensive experience in the organization of the hate department.
“People who know very well Mariusz Kozak-Zagodza – the founder of the “Hejter” profile – are Kierwiński, Budka and Gierty”, said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are social sites and profiles with memes and political jokes.
According to the "Networks", behind the profile of this title is PR-obs Mariusz Kozak-Zagodza.
"We managed to find out that Mariusz Kozak-Zagodda has been employed in the Warsaw city office in the marketing office since April this year", wrote the weekly.
"Confederation" in Oława
At the fair square in Oława, the election committee "Confederation" organized its meeting.

The announced list leader Krzysztof Tuduj did not make it to the election rally.
The candidates raised many problems – from excessive fiscalism of the state to health care problems.
The issue of the economic zone, which should work for all entrepreneurs, rather than favour foreign capital, was also raised.

Boris Johnson to the police supervisory authority in connection with a close relationship with Jennifer Arcuri's businesswoman
The independent IOPC Police Office will examine the possible initiation of an investigation against the Prime Minister as to whether, in the course of his public office as mayor of London, he has committed fraud which constitutes a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in a statement that its Supervisory Inspector had registered the Prime Minister's “issue related to the conduct” in connection with allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from a close relationship between them.
"The question of conduct can be referred to when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
That doesn't mean that it's been proven somehow.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this matter.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police officers in England and Wales.
It was transferred to this police authority because Johnson was the equivalent of a police commissioner and a criminal commissioner at the time.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.
Earlier, he said that he would follow the orders of the London City Council and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but he insisted that the Council "focused on the wrong problem".
The warrant is a result of the "The Sunday Times" report that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 out of budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by then mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government frozen a £100,000 grant to Arcuri's Hacker House pending the investigation.
The government is facing troubling questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds were granted.
The Minister of Digitization, Matt Warman, said in the House of Commons that the employees of his department "usually kept due diligence" and that the company has a British telephone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the number call was redirected to an office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The Prime Minister's close relationship with the businesswoman "was a secret to the staff of the polyshinel".
GLA's decision to refer the Prime Minister to the IOPC's independent police office met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of a higher-ranking representative of the government, it is "politically motivated attack", and its date, on the eve of the Maintenance Party conference, is "politically clear".
"The Supervisor did not provide any evidence to support the allegations, and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to reply before the press release was published late in the evening on Friday," the source claims.
Neither the public nor the media will be fooled by such a clear political bill.
Earlier today, "The Standard" journalists were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businesswoman, who was assisted by a tourism and promotion agency in London, was a "polyshinel mystery" for employees.
The London & Partners (L&P) agency staff recalled that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that at the time its companies were not considered "reliable".
Third accused of narcotics crimes in connection with the death of Mac Miller.
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of last year's death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with committing drug crimes.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills treated with fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for “epidaemia”, which consumed several thousand lives in the United States.
Walter's being accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed off on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of being Walter's courier who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly charged with the murder of Miller and none of them presented a defense in their case.
Walter, who was subject to a conditional release in the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months in prison for violation of the conditions of exemption.
The prosecutors on the case, first reported on Thursday by a website dedicated to the celebrities of TMZ, demand that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the defendant escaping.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine didn't come right away.
Pettit was charged with federal court charges on 4 September, and his attorney refused to comment.
Miller's rhymed lyrics are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, making him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
Originating from Pittsburgh Miller, who really was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years remained in connection with singer Ariana Grande ending earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving film with Miller and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked in recent years to the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the 3 Doors Down band, also died of an overdose in 2016 and found fentanyl and hydrocodone in his body.
This article introduces a change: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games on mobile devices
A 9-year-old creates a fun hide-and-seek game using a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated over 30 games for mobile devices.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player scores every time he catches a bat that comes out of the safe house.
I learned how to make games on an accelerated course.
"Now I make them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, his father enrolled him for a five - day fast - paced course for children aged 5 to 15 years.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played it.
He played a lot of Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games increased when he was 7 years old and got a kick out of spending all his time playing games.
"One day he was playing the tablet, as usual, and he was so wrapped up in it that I got upset," said the father.
Out of anger, I said, "You're still playing, can't you think about creating your own games so that others can play them?"
When I said those words, I was nervous and I didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning to create his own games, urged his parents to buy a laptop and save it for a course during which he learned the basics of creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his thunder titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were praised for using codes to create robots to distribute their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from Ghana's high school won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for stacking boxes.
And thanks to the growing investments of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on their way to the career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit to lying about corruption
It appears from the court documents submitted on Friday that the former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes' statement, he's due to plead guilty next Wednesday.
According to a document containing the factual basis, prepared in the framework of a defense agreement and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense settlement has been sealed, and there is no factual basis to which Hayes' charges will be admitted.
At first he was accused of collusion, corruption and false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the plan of the insurance company's authorities to direct donations to the campaign to the country's main insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two accomplices were charged with trying to bribe state's insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment company, being in recent years one of the main state political donors who has donated over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and politicians of the Republican Party, but he also donated donations to the Democrats.
His lawyer didn't respond to a Friday e-mail asking for comment.
Hayes Kearns Davis' attorney didn't respond to a Friday e-mail asking for comment.
According to court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about the employees of the state's insurance department.
According to the factual basis document, Hayes was actually talking to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to change the personnel employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange a meeting with Causey and that he talked about bribery directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million to Casey's re-election campaign in 2020.
It appears from the indictment that the collusion also included a request to change the department official who controlled Lindberg.
A Republican named Causey reported an alleged attempted corruption against federal agents and helped them gather evidence on the case.
He hasn't been charged with anything.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's accomplice ordered Hayes to hand over $250,000 to the Casey campaign during a conversation where Lindberg and Casey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of that amount of money would draw attention, but, according to the prosecution, he finally stepped down.
“Whatever you all want to do, we will do so,” according to the indictment, Hayes said.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The U.S. Attorney's attorney has not responded to an e-mail requesting further information on the settlement.
The drivers will take the first section of the new burial site
From Saturday the drivers will be able to use the first three mountain sections of the S7 expressway, the new Zakopane road, from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój and further the two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
Iwona Mikrut, a spokesman for the Kraków branch of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), said on Friday, is the first of three sections built S7 south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into service.
From more than 6 km long section from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka more than one third, i.e. approx.
Two and a half miles, she was driven on the overpasses.
Seventeen of them were created, including the longest and tallest, with a kilometre long and 50 m high, and four small objects on the drains at the skomielna node.
From this node there were exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to the national road no. 28 and to the old course DK7.
From the next junction, Zabornia, you can exit on DK47 towards Nowy Targ and Zakopane and on DK7 to Chyżny and the border of the state with Slovakia.
On Zbójecka Góra a place of service for ILO travellers was established.
The expressway ends with the Zabornia node in Rabka Zdrój, to which the two-way section DK47 was added to Chabówka and there it was incorporated into the already existing two-way Chabówka – Rudzawka.
S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Zdrój and a new section of the national road no.47 of the accelerated main class (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment amounted to approx. PLN 615 million.
The quality of the work will be guaranteed for 10 years.
Counting about 16.7 km, a fragment of the new Zakopane, including 15.8 km with expressway parameters, was divided into three production sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubień – Repair, Repair – skomielna Biała and skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is performed by a Polish-Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, tunnel section – Italian company Astaldi, and the third one – Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks amounts to nearly PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union under the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over PLN 1.3 billion.
A total of 38 engineering objects (bridges, viaducts, estakades) and a two-chamber tunnel with a length of 2.06 km are created throughout this section.
According to the announcement of the road manager, a 7.6 km section of Lubień – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7 will be available this year, which drivers will avoid the construction of the tunnel.
In the last section, Repair – Skomielna Biała with a length of about 3 km, drivers will drive in 2021, after the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of about 2.06 km.
Our goal is a state of prosperity.
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland", announced Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to encourage the vote for Councilman Darius Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the welfare state", said the minister.
“We want Poles to earn much better, so that their lives are on a higher level.
It is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that it committed to perform four years ago.
We said we'd put in a 500-plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eve Kopcz said it was impossible that this money just didn't exist.
We proved that the money was and was, only the PO did not care about those to whom they were supposed to go."
Ziobro also reminded about the expedition for children and the 13th pension – and the fact that the 14th pension is also planned.
In addition to the “shrewd distribution of national income”, the priorities of the Law and Justice Party are a fair state and economic development.
Money should not go through a great stream only into the pockets of the chosen ones, who have good relations with the establishment and power, but should reach the whole society evenly – said the politician.
Emmanuel Macron pays tribute to Jacques Chirac
France’s President Emmanuel Macron said good-bye on Thursday in a TV talk by his predecessor Jacques Chirac; he called him a great Frenchman and a great statesman.
At 9 p.m., the lights of the Eiffel Tower went out in tribute to the former president.
Former President and Prime Minister of France Jacques Chirac died on Thursday morning at the age of 86.
Macron's farewell speech was broadcast by all the most important television channels in France.
"He was the man of the state we loved, just as he loved us," said the president.

He has done so much for the nation, for our values, brotherhood and tolerance," continued Macron.
He reminded that Chirac opposed the war with Iraq in 2003, which had no UN mandate, sought peace in the Balkans, stability and peace in Lebanon.
Before the TV performance, Macron went to Chirac's Paris apartment on de Tournon Street.

Part of Sopotka Street in Nisko after expansion
On Tuesday, 24 September, Sopotka Street was officially commissioned in Nisk.
The total value of this task amounted to PLN 803 thousand, of which PLN 26 thousand was a grant from the FDS, while the remaining amount was an own contribution from the Niżański County and the Municipality and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the resources gained, it was possible to make, among other things, a surface over a length of 1284 meters, with its expansion, a pavement over a stretch of 950 meters, dehydration and finishing works.
The contractor of the investment was the consortium of companies: PBI Infrastructure S.A. Z Kraśnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. from Sandomierz.
At the end of 2019/2020, the district of Łódź will carry out a further stage of the extension of Sopotka Street, which will create a new pavement, pavement and a bridge on the Barcówka River.

Facebook for the well-being of users will hide the likes counter to try
As part of the first experiment in the world, which aims to improve the well-being of users, some users of Facebook will soon not see the meter of likes, reactions and video views under other posts.
Likes will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on well-being and mental health experts' opinion that the like counter may encourage comparison with others.
"Many anti-harassment groups, as well as organisations in the field of mental health, responded to us," said Garlick.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of content, not on the number of likes or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be perceived as a competition – she said.
Garlick assured that companies that base their activities on Facebook would continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram, when Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland were tested.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be permanently implemented.
"Users' initial comments on the new rules on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions", she said.
Speaking about the place of the global experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically well-known users of Facebook and Instagram.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with meaningful opinions on whether or not the new experience is valuable for those using our services.
Częstochowa: The councillors want compensation for pilgrims from the curia
The Częstochowa curia has not yet commented on the appeal of the councillors to the metropolitan Archbishop Wenceslaw Depo of providing financial compensation for the operation of the waste economy during the pilgrimage season.
The city applies for PLN 1 from the pilgrim.
The address addressed to the metropolitan was on Friday at a press conference attended, among others, by the Spring Leader Robert Biedron, organized on Jasna Góra Częstochowa Avenue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Vice-President of the City Council and candidate for the Sejm Łukasz Kot.
Kot informed that the day before, local councillors of the SLD voted to call on Archbishop Wenceslas Depo to hand over one gold from every visitor of Czestochowa to support the work of city services, municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean up after the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
"We ask you to transfer to the city's budget a symbolic zloty from every pilgrim.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide better conditions for their stay in Częstochowa", said Vice-President of the City Council.
Fr Mariusz Bakalarz, the spokesman for the metropolitan curia of Częstochowa, initially prepared several responses, but then asked, as he indicated, at the request of Archbishop Depo, to replace it with information about: "Until the official position of the city council is received, we do not refer to the case".
According to the project on the pages of the Częstochowa Magistrate, the appeal to archbishop Depo concerns "the transmission of financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of handling the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, bearing in mind the image of the city among the residents and residents, the pilgrims and the doughnuts, we wish, within the framework of generally accepted canons, to take care of our common good, the small country of Czestochowa, to propose participation in the costs of handling the above-mentioned garbage system", is a fragment of the appeal.
"In order to maintain in good condition the cleanliness of the walking and mobile routes which pilgrims move, while using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste bins, we present a proposal for a symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim", it is written.
"In addition, in connection with participation in annual costs which the city will cover from its own resources, ensuring the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and wishing to emphasise that such cooperation will bring benefits to all parties, we declare that 20% of the above-mentioned amount will be allocated to improve tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available", declared the councillors.
They pointed out that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal stems from numerous concerns raised by residents about the state of purity of the routes which pilgrims are travelling.
"With regard to the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the City Council of Częstochowa calls on the archbishop of the Metropolitan of Częstochowa Wacław Depo to provide financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season", was repeated in the appeal.
According to the press office of Jasna Góra, 834 thousand people participated in 200 nationwide pilgrimages to this sanctuary in the whole last year.
About 124,000 faithful arrived in 255 pilgrimages.
Over 8,8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the sanctuary on horseback, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on roller skates.
"News" TVP left out the Confederacy when describing the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the Law and Justice Sejm, the election would result in 45 percent votes, KO 26 percent, Left 14 percent, PSL 7 percent, and Confederation 5 percent.
It was even written on the "Super Express" portal for which the probe was carried out.
In the main edition of News, describing the same survey, only the first four parties presented the results, completely ignoring the Confederacy.
Edyta Lewandowska, the leader, made it clear that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and entered the Sejm.
TVP viewers were also shown the division of parliamentary seats without taking into account the votes cast for the Confederation.
This would give the Law and Justice a self-government.
In his comment on the whole situation, Krzysztof Bosak spoke about "public compromise on the issue of honesty towards society".
“They started with the slogans about the “moral revolution”, he reminded and stated that this issue was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki tweeted that "TVP News" in subsequent actions against the Confederacy embarrass Urban and Michnik".
He also pointed out the lack of reactions from right-wing journalists.
“But let us also look at those who acceptably remain silent.
These “righteous”, “independent”, “insubordinate”.
In a few years they became a more primitive version of everything they supposedly fought," he added.
Małgorzata Motylow vice president of NIK

Brother sentenced to life sentence for the murder of honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos published on social networks, was strangled in July 2016.
Brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment as the loudest "honor killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – polite according to Western standards, but in strongly misogynistic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and said that he “of course” murdered his sister and that her behavior was “unacceptable”.
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP that a court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be acquitted by a higher court," he said.
Before that, Baloch’s mother, Anwar Mai, announced to AFP that she had hoped that her son would be acquitted.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder came to the forefront of the world's news services and resumed calls for action against the epidemic of so-called honor killings, in which victims – usually women – are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for such crimes as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family “asham” through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
Murders are usually done by a close relative.
According to the Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after the Baloch murder, Parliament adopted new legislation imposing a life sentence for honor killings.
However, whether a murder is considered an honorary crime remains a matter for the judge, which means that murderers may theoretically rely on another motive and be acquitted.
In Baloch’s case, her parents initially insisted that their son be shown no mercy.
However, they were devastated to think that they too might lose him, changed their mind, and declared that they wanted him acquitted.
The international outrage caused by the murder has prompted the Pakistani State to take an unprecedented step and declare itself heir with its parents, forcing the case to move forward.
One of Baloch's more famous achievements is offering stripping in front of the Pakistani cricket team and wearing a decolleted purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many, including young people, saw her as a breaking limit in a country where posing as Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to empower women.
The roots of the "honorable" killing lie in tribal social norms, which continue to prevail in South Asia, and in particular regulate the behaviour of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced persons from northwest Nigeria to 40 000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations reported that increasing violence has doubled the number of people displaced from north-western Nigeria to around 40,000 in the last four months.
The UN Refugee Agency has stated that the unrest has created a "new emergency humanitarian situation", which requires an interagency effort to raise new funds of USD 35,5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, the spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north of the country for a decade, is not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina has been observed in the last 10 months rather than as a result of the actions of organised armed groups.
"This is a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told journalists on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder, and sexual assault by attackers who also destroy houses and steal possessions.
Military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is being pulled away from the battles with Boko Haram and from the Islamic State in West Africa, which separated itself from its former group in 2016.
“Refugees do not come with the names of groups,” he said.
But they come with terrible stories.
Refugees mostly enter the neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that he expected more people to flee to Niger in the coming months with a deteriorating security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for a man accused of killing a woman and two children.
A new date of trial was scheduled for a Guatemalan man accused of killing a resident of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Polk County District Court file, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under, as the authorities claim, a false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son dead on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
The court file shows that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give the representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials claim that Escobar-Orellana is illegally in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson in the face of a mutiny of the cabinet wanting to lower the brexit demands and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country around the Prime Minister, there is growing concern that he will not have enough time to obtain major concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of mutiny from the cabinet wanting to lower the demands of the brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The negotiations had a deadlock on the new customs system, which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, since Brussels set out proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "non- feasible".
Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, led by German head Angela Merkel, to offer the critical leader of the Tories at the last minute a compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
Journalists "The Sun" spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual Tories conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister to accuse a "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominic Cummings of trying to bluff the EU and threaten to leave the Union without agreement and then accept the last-minute offer made by the Union.
One cabinet minister described the devastating verdict of the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday on the termination of Parliament's suspension as a “warning signal” and added: “The only way we leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of an agreement.
We will never overcome arithmetic in the House of Commons, which is working against us.
The Prime Minister must now bow down and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan failed.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister has committed himself to hand Johnson over to try to push through the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else fails.
The minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to resubmit the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the House of Commons."
There are many chances that she will be voted on, and everyone is very interested in ending the subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a brief speech, the former Tory Minister said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he wrestles with bulls in Scotland, checks eggs in Wales and fights with citizens in the main streets of cities – everything in front of the world, as if the election campaign was already going on for good."
The spokesman for the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still distant, and added: "No one should have illusions: a very long way to reach an agreement."
However, the Ombudsman also said that the Benna Act implementing the brexit postponement by three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law is making it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work."
The brexit secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how the zone works for all of Ireland for food and living.
A dog with no nose and no legs conquers Instagram.
Perfectly non-perfect
The mutt was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal at first sight.
"Initially, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt, because we had three dogs already," she said.
The woman made a decision that she would take care of the bitch until someone didn't adopt her.
But still no one came forward.
“The fact that no one wanted her made me want to look after her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
“Our Bonnie is perfectly unperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, that's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
More than 14,000 netizens are watching her on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, the heads of television said that due to the Glasgow accent, she would "never make a career" as a newscaster.
Recalling her 35-year-old career in the television industry, Kelly, age 59, admitted that before her first performance on the screen she felt "a lot of nervousness".
"I was only 25 years old and very nervous," she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a search and checking specialist, the chief of chiefs said that my Glasgow accent would never succeed on television.
I went to London to meet the entire TV-am team and watch the broadcast before I took over my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget the Bette Davis interview with Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to stay.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV-am correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
Then she started running shows like "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to later start with her morning program "Lorraine", which she named after.
The 35th anniversary of her career will celebrate a special program, during which she will remember her best-remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret to her long internship on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity", adding: "You have to work hard.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was “very difficult” for her to report the Dunblane bombing.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children watched our show live from Dunblane the day after the terrible killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for hours at her house.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral where I attended.
She added that the interview with Kate and Gerry McCanna was "very difficult" shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "she really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they do not know what happened to their beloved daughter, and to endure the most terrible comments of online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The program for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 on Monday, September 30 at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
A senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the offer made by the late President Robert Mugabe at the height of the coup, because he was afraid of being imprisoned in order to confirm that the military took over power in November 2017.
As reported last week by "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga the presidency during his negotiations with the military during the coup.
However, a senior government official stated on social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer out of fear, but because he reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he actually lost during the coup.
On Twitter, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga and not President Emerson Mnangagwa, Jamwand 2, on which government officials confirmed that he was a senior state official at the President's Office and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there were intense negotiations on this matter at that time.
State officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was slipping from his hands.
Mediations between military authorities and the deceased former president were, according to a senior state official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was the spokesman for President George Charamba, the person who was then the head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nhepera and the clergyman representing Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to pass on the offer of the Chiwenga presidency, which was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (SOZ).
A man who was even more recognized as an icon of Africa after his death was in vain trying to get the U.A. to condemn military action, trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the President, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) of Chiwenga, was not a choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took dangerously fast pace, removing part of the family of the deceased," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political temptation, with which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-democratic way.
It is sufficient to recall that the commanders declared that they did not overthrow and overthrow the constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the AU's stance on the coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would take the bait, abruptly interrupting the leaders' claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, by the way, was still highly confused by the whole situation and the way it fits into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such calculation that this offer was made.
The officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defenses were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the mighty man that he was risking a Gaddafi-style lynching.
The military chiefs told him they wouldn't return the rifles against the citizens if they went to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, that is to save his family and prove that the army took over," added the official.
At that time, the SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The emissary (Gono) who carried this desperate message was given to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that issu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (member of the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or competing with each other at the political level, claimed a senior government official.
State officials say that the military has notified military commanders in the area via attaché, who were in Zimbabwe, that they are not going to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the “criminalists” surrounding it.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to tempt Mnangagwa again to return from a short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about a coup and succession.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The people of South Africa, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma was president of Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly pointed out that if the military invades Mugabe's house, as many times feared in the background, the armies of South Africa will immediately arrive in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said an informant.
China needs strong leadership or it will fall apart, as stated in the policy document
China needs strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, or the country will fall apart", stated the government in a policy document issued on Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The press office of the Chinese government stated in the White Paper that the success of the country since the Communists took power 70 years ago has come down to the leadership of the party.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, and there are rarely administrative difficulties here.
The document mentions that without a single and strong leadership, China will move towards division and decay, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long applied a hard-hand policy in solving problems, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who will be at the forefront of the anniversary of the second largest economy in the world on Tuesday, has further tightened the party's governance and sanctioned those who may question the authority since the day he took office at the end of 2012.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation programme, which has upset the region.
The document states that China is not trying to export its development model or to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony".
The Chinese don't have any other nations or world domination in their genes.
In modern times, China was oppressed by the great powers, and wars and unrest left a deep mark on them as a result of suffering; China will never inflict on others the suffering it suffered.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country involved in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in China under Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and the further increase in tariffs do not lead to a solution to the problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market and a strong economic growth rate.
The document adds that "trade wars will never weaken it".
China is sure to be able to face difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should rationally look at China's development, because China does not intend to challenge the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that it will stop China's development.
The reduction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
The world of Jack Pałkiewicz: Dubai, the real face
The Dubai Emirat is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, Islamic religious radicalism and progressive extremism.
This trend-setting leader of world tourism stimulates the imagination and desires, eavesdropping on the vanity of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting fortune-seeking investors and merchants with the status of a tax haven.
Websites infect with the enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentrate of architecture of the 21st century in one.
Founded on oil-rich sands, the emirat became the Eden for those who love cheapness, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many delight in the ubiquitous here, appreciate the creative hyperactivism and the hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto is to "surprise, dazzle and charm".
Almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the extremes and contradictions of the metropolis have taken on the dimension of a tacky grotesque.”
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, the unofficial constitution of the emirate.
Because here everything has to be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
However, among the excess and ostentatious excesses, there is something missing that is perhaps not clear in old Europe, but important for quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid everyone feels like they are in their home.
And not in Dubai.
Running away from the world of magic, I ripped off his golden mask, revealing the second face of an artificial paradise.
A face you don't talk loud about or write about.
I show Asian poverty contrasting with fairytale living conditions of the divine caste of the ethnic Dubaians, the grandchildren of the illiterate Bedouins.
I go to a place of extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where the army of Asian workers is living in cruel conditions.
It was they who built the desert Manhattan sky under slave conditions in one generation.
They came here in good money and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and there was a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai over the years.
The growing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labour highly problematic for emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team banned dietary discussions in her home after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls team admitted that there is a ban on diet in her home, after she herself struggled with eating disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
Sporty Spice for years did not eat and "obsessively exercise" as a result of the pressure of being a member of the world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences affect how she is raising her daughter Scarlet, so she “does not allow people to talk about diets in her home.”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I think one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak in front of it.
Using a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for Women's Health Mel magazine, which gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that during the days before the rise of social media in the press, “disturbing” comments about her caused complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain groups of food products, practicing more and more obsessively until I was underweight," he says.
"I was sick, and it probably took a few years."
A Picture That Stimulated the World
A Polish girl and an American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen in the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
“Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!", began his radio talk documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic September days of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His account echoed widely in the West.
The President of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, loaned him a car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe, and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever the Warsawers were.
400 planes and artillery were almost non-stop attacking the city.
Bryan took pictures of death, suffering, fighting for survival in the ruins of the city.
Just before the surrender, he and the embassy staff took the negatives out of the ocean.
He kept talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London and even New York."
His shocking chronicles were watched by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They made movies glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
A jury hearing against an ex-athlete accused of multiple rapes
There's a trial in front of the jury for a rape case against a former baseball player at Delaware University, accused of multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, members of the jury decided on the fate of a 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who was 21 years old claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two of them had made contact on the Bumble meeting page and sent the man a picture of him naked.
The woman is one of six accusing Conaway of sexual assault in 2013-2018.
According to the accusers, hugging, which the woman agreed to, turned into a rape, which happened to her opposition.
Defenders point to conflicting relationships between women and gaps in memory, and claim that the woman probably regretted having had an intimate relationship.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
The gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys could be seen at the 10th edition of the Kielce Bike Fair BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, has just received an Oscar for his bike at the World Exhibition of Custom Bikes in Las Vegas.
"The bike is covered with gold chrome spray, under it is the highest silver sample.
It's an unusual shell made by a friend of mine from Żor.
"There's a saddle, there's pedals, there's a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can increase the speed of 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bicycle," his constructor explains.
‘The bicycle car body was printed on a 3D printer.
It's a cube forming a kind of vortex.
I came up with this model on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and hid it deep in a drawer.
The sketch waited five years for the execution.
The bike itself was created for three years", adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was very difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside there are batteries, wires, elements forming the structure.
It's hidden under a car body soaked in 11 elements on a steel bicycle frame.
There's an engine hidden there, too.
The steering wheel for this bike was created a week before I left for the United States for the World Bike Show.
I couldn't quite figure out what the steering wheel was.
She's making up for transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he concludes.
The gold-covered bike was recognized in Las Vegas as the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom copy".
The film shows a strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay, surrounded by the opera building, Circular Quay Port, Luna Park Amusement Park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge Bridge makes an important contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, pumped into the Australian economy every year by tourists visiting Sydney.
But underneath the bridge is an ugly truth.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country, to which the volume of pollution equals the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools each year.
These horrifying statistics make one of our greatest tourist assets one of our dirtiest waters at the same time.
According to a new film entitled “Sydney Bay – on top and bottom”, the waters in the area of the most popular city of Australia are full of cigarette butts, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay along with rainwater.
However, the largest component of our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, in a video published on 27 September, with the publication of this film deliberately coincides with World Tourism Day.
It looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated escapes of rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that about 1560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and most of it flows into the bay through a storm drain.
"After such a massive fall in the bay... it looks rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean goes to the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you can't really realize what's in there," said Richard Nichollls, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team pull out about 500 kg of plastic each year from the water.
I think if more people knew what was under the water, they would just be scared.
It's overwhelming... over half of what we find at the bottom is plastic mesh.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all that other junk we're pulling out right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways in which people, both local and tourists, could help reduce the amount of plastic and residues entering our waterways.
"It must start at its source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, we need to better recover materials and be more aware of what we flush in the sewers that end up in the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we will be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our source of food.
But we can sort out this bay and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film material, funded by the TOMRA recycling company in its wider efforts to educate Australians on environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that are often found in the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health, which was published this month.
A new survey among 546 children aged 12 to 18 found that 82% of respondents feel helpless with plastic waste and 25% blame adults for the waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns were growing with the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after the volleyball match in the semi-finals of ME
It wasn't an easy game.
Slovenians had a lively audience on their side, which effectively distracted Polish volleyball players.
There was also much controversy among the judges, who did not count four rebounds on the side of the hosts in one of the actions.
It happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen's wards had a chance to bounce off their rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles eventually had to recognise the superiority of the rival, who will play in the finals of the tournament after the 3-1 win.
Ghana: Kaneshie Traders Support the Accra Psychiatric Hospital
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated 30 000 GH worth of food yesterday to the asylum in Accra during a brief ceremony in Accra.
This is part of the activities of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
The donations included, among others, various food products, fruits, soft drinks, biscuits, clothing, yams, paradise bananas, manioc and water bags.
During the visit, the group also spoke to several patients of the facility.
The event was attended by Accra Markets Limited executives, association directors and mother's queens.
Presenting the items, Mrs. Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, President of the Women's Market Association of the Great Accra Region, announced that the donation is part of the regular social responsibility charity activities of the group.
She noted that supporting care for patients of the institution was necessary to show them love and to let them feel part of society.
Ms Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow this gesture.
While accepting gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the hospital director, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be used well for the benefit of the patients.
She appealed to other organizations for support for the hospital.
Google creates a cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the Operator of the National Cloud, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
Digitalisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of creating the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, shareholders of this company.
The Partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we set up less than a year ago, announcing the appointment of the Operator of the National Cloud.
The goal remains unchanged – digitization of the Polish economy and dynamics of its growth.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
Using them, they increase their chances of getting promoted to the World League, which we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining their group today is really strengthening our joint project", says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
"The investment in the National Cloud Operator fits perfectly into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitisation.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it", added Paweł Boris, President of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland in the service portfolio will find all the key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", says Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
He adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the need for computing power needed to process huge data sets.
VI National Senior Parade
On the afternoon of August 24, 2019, at the Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the 6th Seniors Parade "Matures of the Great" and Picnic Generations, organized by the Zaczyn Foundation, began.
According to Przemysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation: “Parada is an evenement on a global scale.
It has already passed through the center of Warsaw for the sixth time to demonstrate how large and diverse the elderly are.
Through the Parade, we counter harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was led by a special two-story coach serving as a musical mobile scene, on which the famous Warsaw DJ Wika has traditionally performed.
Participants in the joyful corvoda, at the second known Warsaw and world hits, passed the Jerozolimskie Avenues, Krucza Street to the Warsaw Uprising Square, Mazowiecka Street to J. Piłsudski Square and Królewski and Krakowskie Przedmieście Street to the Warsaw University Main Campus.
During the march, which was attended by several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organizations from all over Poland, colorful delegations were greeted with applause by numerous people gathered on the route of march, Warsawers and tourists.
Two organized groups in the company's yellow and blue T-shirts took part in the parade from Legionowo.
The first one representing the University of the Third Century and the Senior+ Club and the second one called SAGA, the Senior Active Animator Group.
In the campus, organizers prepared among others catering stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Stand of Stylish Seniors from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrał, you could get tips and information about current trends in fashion 60+.
The stand also offered a workshop to learn how to move around the stage and pose for photos.
The culmination was a fashion show of stylish seniors.
On the stand of the National Voice of Senior there was the latest edition of the magazine and materials concerning the campaign "Stop manipulation – Don't buy at the presentation!".
The next stands offered beauty, movement, artistic and artistic workshops.
On a few you could do research and consult specialists on health and nutrition issues.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadli, Mariola Boyarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow or Robert Janowski.
The picnic did not lack any vocal and musical attractions.
On the stage there was a legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was an intergenerational dancing which was led by DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have the key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have found a way to mask certain cancer cells.
The researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treating cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treating fatal facial tumors threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study determined how certain cancer cells were masked in both humans and marsupials, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which disables the marker, which would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This can be the biggest challenge in treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and a type of skin cancer called Merkla cell cancer.
“The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance to immune therapy, we can be able to reverse this process,” said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed towards re-activation of markers, called MHC proteins, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
“ Potentially this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,” said Professor Dawson.
"This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And we may be able to treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat tumors of the face of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells in a similar way avoid detection.
"It is unusual that the exact same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in Tasmanian devils)", said Professor Dawson.
"So far it has been very difficult to treat the tumors of Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists astounded by the fact that there is a very large planet orbiting a really small star
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of the solar system 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the formation of planets, because in this system a large planet similar to Jupiter orbits a small star called the red dwarf.
An artistic illustration of the planet type gas giant GJ 3512b orbiting the central star being a red dwarf, published on September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 represents about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute for Space Research at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, which was at the forefront of research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of the formation of solar systems suggest that low mass stars usually become parent stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a gas-like giant planet similar to Jupiter orbiting a very small star" - added Morales.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full lap takes 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to a certain extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately under 3800 Kelvin (degrees) (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they're reddish," Morales said.
"There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet may have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which may explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," says Morales.
Planets are made from the same interstellar gas and dust disc that gives birth to the star around which the planet is orbiting.
According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the model of acretion, the object originates from particles in the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet at an early stage of development allows the atmosphere to be formed from the surrounding gas.
This unusual arrangement can be explained by a competitive model called the gravitational instability model.
"In such a case, the protoplanetary disc around the young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a loss in the stability of the disk, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses may increase until the planet collapses and forms.
Delicate worker accused of administering methamphetamine-containing bean dip co-workers
The Marion County Sheriff's Department has arrested Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for administering a co-workers of bean dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, a 38-year-old Albany named Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of supplying methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The charge was based on a 9 September event at a thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In an oath made by OregonLive.com, a 27-year-old co-worker of the suspect told the deputy sheriff of Marion County that during lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez do the bean dip and then gave it to her.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she told the investigators, had never taken meth, said that "she thought that one piece she ate tasted strangely, but it did not raise any suspicions about it".
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a stomach upset and that she couldn't stand up.
According to Albany Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was established that bean dip could contain methamphetamine.
According to police reports from The Smoking Gun, another employee of the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez "has told her that she will add drugs to food", while another admitted that the suspect sent her a message claiming that meth was accidentally sent to the bean dip.
OregonLive's website announces a surveillance video from the deli, which allegedly shows how Medina-Hernandez pulls something out of the bra behind the microwave and bends.
Then it straightens, wipes its nose, comes up to the table and puts the bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
The Oregon Stateman-Journal reports that the sheriff's office officials say there's no suspicion that the customers are being given contaminated food at the moment.
Medina-Hernandez is in prison in Marion County, with a fixed deposit of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, supply of meth, theft, possession of meth, and possession of illicit weapons.
Johnson's giving a blow to the adjournment confusion.
Boris Johnson's journey to the United Nations General Assembly was badly interrupted by the historic ruling of the Supreme Court.
However, his devastating speech in the House of Commons did not reveal any shame or remorse.

“The Slovaks played very well in every element.
It's a shame about the ends of the sets, because we had our chances, but we didn't take them.
We do not hang heads because on Saturday the match for the bronze medal", said the quarterback of the Polish volleyball team Marcin Komenda after defeating Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-finals of the European championship.
A talented player appeared on the field in the second and third sets.
According to some, Vital Heynen should give him a better chance to show off his skills.
The Eagle selector, however, chose Fabian Drzyzga's experience.
"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": castings for Jamie New's role on the West End
Another big West End star is waiting to be discovered, even though she doesn't know it yet.
Producers of the "Everybody's Talking About Jamie" musical are looking for another Jamie New and holding open auditions
The current star Layton Williams sets off with a musical on a tour in Great Britain, so the producers in his place are looking for “a particularly talented, undiscovered young artist”.
Interviews in London will take place on October 10th at the Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 bars of the song opening "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CV and portrait.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and the next week before the producers there will be people invited to the presentation again.
The producer Nica Burns said: "We are pleased to say that thanks to our fantastic audience, the musical will be played for another third year at Apollo."
We found some fantastic young performers joining Layton Williams and Shane Richie on a tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical, we open up opportunities for unknown talents that will join the current young professionals.
Williams, who played Jamie New in February and thus replaced John McCrea, encouraged on Twitter "All Boys to send their tapes":
Tournée of this musical will start in February and the West End shows will be extended until 29 August 2020.
The musical depicts the fate of 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the graduation dance in a dress.
He doesn't know what the future holds, but he's sure he'll be a star.
With the help of her mother and local legend of the Loco Chanelle drug community, she begins to discover her identity, resist prejudice and career in the light of flashes.
Music in this performance inspired by a BBC documentary entitled "Jamie. Drag Queen at 16" was written by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and lyrics by Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval acquires a commission in the natural gas industry worth SEK 110 million
Alfa Laval, a world leader in heating, centrifugal separation and liquid transport, has obtained an order to supply air coolers to a gas treatment plant in the USA. This order is worth approximately 110 million Swedish krona and has been registered in the Welded Heat Exchangers Department in the power sector and the deliveries are planned for 2020.
The order includes the installation of Alfa Laval Niagara air coolers, which will be used in refrigeration systems to separate natural gas into individual streams of its pure ingredients – ethane, propane and butane.
Safety is crucial in all industrial processes and is extremely important for demanding applications related to the treatment of natural gas.
"Our reliable systems of air coolers are appreciated because of their safe work, which ensures peace of mind for customers in the natural gas industry", says Susanne Pahlen Aklundh, President of the Energy Department.
Did you know that... ethane, propane and butane can be extracted from natural gas and then used, for example, as input material for petrochemical installations, house heating or as fuel for vehicles?

Marian Banas.
What's the KAS doing about the head of the NIK?
Renting property for an amount below the market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
We asked about what the IRS is doing in this matter in the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in a report for TVN's Supervisier, presented doubts about the property statements made by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasia.
They've been being investigated by the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau for months now.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a 400 square meters tenement house and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65,7 thousand zlotys per year.
The report "Superwizjier" revealed that the hotel was rented in a tenement house for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on national television why he collected only a little over PLN 5 thousand per month for the rental of real estate.
"Gazeta Wyborcza", referring to real estate valuation experts, estimated that for the building itself it should be 15 thousand PLN per month.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary agreement and it was precisely the fact that the tenant was to buy this tenement, that I agreed to a lower rent, that the remaining claims would be settled when selling the tenement house", Banas argued.
However, there have been doubts as to whether such conduct constitutes a breach of the law.
Konrad Zawada, Press Spokesperson of the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow, informed TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"Any such questions please address to the Minister of Finance", he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "the activities are carried out by the National Tax Administration".
The Press Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the National Tax Administration itself monitors many cases that may raise some concerns.
"National Tax Administration works in such a way that it has its own information and is based in a sense on information that is available to the public.
On this basis, he decides whether or not to proceed with any specific case", explained the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"However, due to the fact that we are all bound in the entire Ministry of Finance, we never speak because we cannot speak in individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company", he emphasized, when asked about the case of Marian Banasia.
The Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "the tax offices do not send this type of news to the public".
"It is known that the entire treasury apparatus deals with a lot of similar cases throughout the country", he pointed out.
Royal Family Secrets: Surprising guests often flying a royal plane were revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world during their lives.
This is usually facilitated by a royal aircraft – a private machine that carries the royal family around the world for important events and speeches.
It's no surprise that having your own plane is a privilege.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, their limits on the number of baggage are not applicable, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests aboard – including really unusual ones.
According to the recently released Channel 5 documentary, not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel on a royal plane.
During the program entitled "Secrets of King's flights", the former navigator of the Queen's flights revealed that furred guests often flew with the royal family.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly."
It is not surprising that the queen may have wished that her beloved favorites would accompany her on her journeys, for she is known for her deep attachment to corgi dogs.
From an early age, Queen Elizabeth was a lover of these four - footed creatures, and it has been said that since the coronation she had owned more than 30 corgis.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linneta, Willowa and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs that cross the dachshund with corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
I'm sure the crew of the royal plane had their hands full.
There was seen an employee of the royal house walking dogs and asking them to settle their needs before taking them on board the plane," says Shields.
I'm glad to say there's never been an incident.
The program also reveals the shocking number of baggage that the Queen takes with her on board during her journey in the performance of her duties.
The narrator said: "In 1953, the queen took her luggage weighing 12 tons on her journey of 70,000 kilometres."
To be able to picture it better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only one with a weakness for fashion.
It is said that the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own tastes regarding the transport of her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dresses has a separate seat.
The new bill is coming into force.
If you are injured in accidents, you will receive a pension.
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that those seriously injured in the event of further payment of pensions – informs the Financial Ombudsman.
This is the Law of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of victims in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee amount established under the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns people who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time there were significantly lower guarantee amounts than today, so in some cases insurers have already ceased to pay their pensions.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has been seeking for many years to create a mechanism that will provide for those seriously injured in accidents a guarantee of financial support from the insurance of the OC or OC of the farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount", says Aleksander Daszewski, legal counsel at the Office of the Financial Ombudsman.
In the opinion of the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary, because it is often very tragic for people in very poor health, who, due to accidents, cannot work, but at the same time bear significant costs after accident rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensation and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of so-called guarantee amounts on OC policies.
Some of them have been threatened in the coming years.
Until 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurer were significantly lower than the current limits.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee amount in previous years was most common to those who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were very low and economic conditions resulted in an increase in prices.
"We also noticed that this problem was also affecting a number of young people who suffered damage at a time when the sum was EUR 350 000 for each victim in the accident.
Currently, it is €5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of victims.
So it is a huge difference compared to earlier periods, hence the problem required the intervention of the legislator", recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee amount is increasing from time to time, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of the liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time when the claim for the pension was sent to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a court ruling fixing the amount of guarantee other than that laid down in the OC insurance contract.
This is the case in the case of an increase in the amount of the guarantee on a judicial basis pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing obligation relationship.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to those who have asked us to intervene in the past.
We inform about new powers in them and, of course, we assure about the possibility of providing further support in the event of any problems arising", says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off her boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, that's when Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed his friends the sex tape that was made in their bedroom.
A 28 - year - old who was an architect explained to the court that the partner had ruined her life in this way and treated her as a “trophy” to boast of in front of her friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The woman in Cordoba decided to bring justice herself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
With a velvet band, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the shears and cut off his penis.
“I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull up my pants and grab my cell phone to call 911," the victim testified.
“I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by exposing her sex tape, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said to the jury.
Eventually, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, a retired Republican congressman of Alabama, Jack Edwards, who served for the 10th term and was part of the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South, died.
Family spokesman said Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after fighting pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans in Alabama, in the Deep South, because the party was gaining supporters here.
He served ten term in Congress.
According to a statement made by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its great-grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like the courtesy of returning.
"I hope that my great-grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will grow up in a country where kindness will return to the common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems," said Edwards, according to a family statement.
The Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that in honor of him, the flags on the Alabama Capitol will be lowered to half the mast.
“He was the embodiment of a true civil servant and was the best statesman for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most outstanding politicians" - said Ivey in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed her appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better."
Princess and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether it's meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, it's an inspiration for a lot of people," Obama added, posting a picture of smiling Meghan posing with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which was hospitablely edited by a former actress of the series "Suits".
In an honest conversation, the first lady talked about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means getting into the mastery of letting go," Obama said in an interview.
“My motherhood taught me that most of the time it is my job to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want them to be, or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in their hearts.
Obama, who in her experience knows the pressure of being on the candlestick, shared with the Duchess during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – imposed by yourself and others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
“So my advice is to slow down and not rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughter, making sure that they were doing well at school and making new friends before I devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think we need that, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains a permit to sell alcohol despite complaints against the owner's disposition
WAWINGTON (AP) – The D.C. Alcohol Control Commission rejected the request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its licence to sell alcohol on account of the owner’s disposition.
On Wednesday, the Agency ordered that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis was unfounded because most of them do not live in a district or have no real estate in it.
"The Washington Post" states that for the second time these plaintiffs have sought to withdraw the hotel's licence for the sale of alcohol, referring to the provision in force in the district which states that applicants for a licence for the sale of alcohol must show a "good attitude".
In the original complaint filed last summer, it was claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and there were allegations of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was submitted.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
"The Sun": The pulping report considers Cleveland's notorious scandalous police force the worst in Britain
Inspectors considered the police as the worst in the United Kingdom to be compromised.
In their crushing report, they assessed the Cleveland police work as inadequate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Inspectorate of Police says that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in the Cleveland Police Department.
There have been new calls for the resolution of police services, led by five chiefs in six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Majesty's Police said: "Since our last inspection there has been a significant deterioration of standards."
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious", though undisclosed, allegations of his conduct.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts was suspended from custody for gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared in front of a commission on misdemeanors for equipping coworkers for sexual activities.
He's out of the service.
Tory Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for Home Office's department to intervene now."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said: "After the improvements, I take full responsibility for conducting police forces through change."
We've got a skatepark visual!
Will young people finally live to see it?
The elderly are disturbed by young enthusiasts of scooters and skateboards, and they complain that there is no place suitable for them in Oława.
For years young people have been asking for a place to skate, skateboard, scooters, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our cracks.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Lately, it's all over again about the lack of skatepark.
That's why we go back to it and ask the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago there was a woman who was disturbed by young people driving downtown.
"I am writing on behalf of the residents of the block at Pilsudski Square so that one can be interested in the situation of Oławska youth", writes Małgorzata.
“The residents of the block called the City Guard repeatedly in vain.
To prove such everyday situations in the attachment, I send pictures."
We asked the others what they thought about it.
Most clearly state that young people simply have nowhere to go in the city and have been unsuccessfully demanding space for themselves for years.
Under the Facebook post there was an avalanche of comments.
Already in July we wrote that there was a chance for skatepark to be built on the Oławskie Town.
The mayor announced that the city had requested funding for the construction of the skatepark.
"The project and the permit are ready to be consulted with young people.
On 28 March, an application was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism to fund the project entitled “Building Skatepark in Oława” as part of the Sportowa Polska programme”, we were told at the office.
Total project value: PLN 798 306.00.
Subsidy amount requested: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we asked again at what stage the case is.
"We do not yet have information on the decisions concerning the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism", informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the Department of European Funds of Oława University.
"From the information obtained from the staff of the Ministry, it is clear that in the end all tasks of the Sport Programme Poland should be selected in October".
We also asked to visualize the skatepark in Oławski.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editor that next Saturday (28 September) they would collect signatures under a petition concerning the construction of skatepark in Oława.
"The renegade youth saw the last Facebook post and concluded that they would organize a fundraiser", writes Mikołaj's editor.
The petition signatures will be collected from 12.00 in the Lidl market area.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 finals.
We know a couple, a hit from years ago.
It was one of the fiercest rivalries in the extra class.
The biggest legend was a memorable match from the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, the Legion took up a team at the old stadium in Łazienkowska in the penultimate line.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, Widzew was the second Polish championship in a row.
Up to 87 minutes Legia led 2:0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the Łódź club was getting into more and more trouble, until it stopped counting in the championship fight and fell from the top-class competition.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The Legion – on the way to the title – won two wins – 5:1 at home and 1:0 at the departure.
Return to the elite
Today, boaters are fighting for a return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least a year, since in previous games they were not able to advance to the back of the class.
As a result of this failure in summer, there was a staff revolution at the club.
The authorities have changed, the coach Marcin Kaczmark has finally been put on, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy, Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdzyń are to help those trained in league fights.
For now Widzew is the fourth in the II league table, but in the Polish Cup he defeated the vice-leader of the Śląsk Wroclaw 2-0.
The Legion in the same sizes played on the departure of the Niepołomice Forest.
Extra-class start-up
The only pair made up of top-class representatives in the 1/16 finals are her benjaminek ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place on 29-31 October.
This year, 1/8 of the finals are scheduled to be played (3-5 December).
The final is scheduled to take place on 2 May at PGE Narodowy in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “rebellied” and the impeachment investigation must be on its way
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are involved in an attempt to conceal the facts of an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation may take some time", said Pelosi in an interview with CNN at Capitol Hill.
"They will do the work they started by sticking to the facts and time necessary to find them," she added.
According to the White House's report this week, Trump asked the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenski to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on this matter, as the protocol shows.
Trump denied he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Justice Department had notified a complaint by the whistleblower concerning Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than one week before the formal notification.
Upon receiving a complaint as a complaint from officials at Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice stated that Trump's phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
When asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call to the stand.
However, she added that she felt that Barr had “rebellioned”.
It's been like this for a long time.
“Barra is mentioned in all this,” Pelosi added, referring to Trump’s mention of her attorney general during a talk with the leader of Ukraine in July.
It's interesting that he made decisions about how the complaint was handled.
Pelosi stated that she was “very afraid” of whistleblowers, whom Trump attacked as spies on Thursday, suggesting that in the past spies had been treated differently.
I think the President's words go beyond responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our whistleblowers play an important role in discovering – exposing violations in our government", said Pelosi, adding "The President's words concerning those who can provide information are clearly seriously undermining the integrity of the government".
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historic step in announcing a formal investigation into an illegal act based on allegations of trying to pressure a foreign leader to obtain political benefits.
The telephone call was included in a complaint published on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his power to “bring Ukraine into interference” during the forthcoming 2020 elections.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers had officials remove the record of the conversation from the computer system, where it was stored for the needs of officials of the Council of Ministers, and put it in a system intended for sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving for excessive speed for Crystal Palace's attacker Christian Benteke
The Premier League star Christian Benteke, who has been caught speeding twice in the last two months, is in danger of being banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's attacker, 28 years old, admitted to driving a Bentley car at 80 miles per hour in an area with a limit of 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond, southwest London on January 20.
Then, in March, Putney’s photo-radiators in southwest London registered a Belgian at 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Benteke of Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to go to the Lavender Hill Peace Court this morning.
He admitted to both offences at the beginning of July under a simplified procedure whereby lighter crimes are judged at a sitting conducted by a single judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasaacas club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The verification committee should be composed of neutral external persons who do not have links with any of the members and who have not previously shown an interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer regarding the payment of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he has an interest in this", he claimed.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, were to stand before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his association with the club, suggesting that if the Commission had Palmer, he would be subject to prejudice and bias.
As expected, the members of the Commission were to start work from yesterday, after the ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and finish it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Mr Frank Davies, and her members are the Corporate Governance Consultant and Mrs Marian Barnor's lawyer and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akkova, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.
‘SE’: Kornel Morawiecki in severe condition in hospital
Marshal Kornel Morawiecki, the legend of Solidarity and the father of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, went back to the hospital – says "Super Express".
Politician's in bad shape.
78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki has been struggling with pancreatic cancer for many months.

Israel: There is no agreement on the Government of Unity
The two main parties of Israel, the Blue-White Alliance and Likud, continued negotiations on Friday to establish a government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the president had entrusted the mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanyahu as Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli newspaper "Haarec" writes, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will resume on Sunday.
The Centre's Blue-White Alliance announced in its communication that it had put forward preliminary proposals.
He accuses the right-wing Likud of having "draw himself into his positions", demanding that his leader and his former Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government and, in his cabinet, former ultraorthodox politicians.
"From the very beginning, it was clear that Blue-Whites would not agree to these conditions," says their message.
For Likud, acting solely in the interests of Netanyahu, wants to "bring the second round of elections in Israel".
The leader of the Blue-White Benny Gantz refuses to support the government, which Netanyahu would lead, as long as he is charged with participating in three corruption scandals, on the basis of which the prosecution could formally prosecute him after a Wednesday meeting.
"Likud and Blue and White got enough in the elections on September 17th to allow them to rule together as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which neither party wanted," writes EFE.
President Reuwen Rivlin has tried to bring their positions closer together in recent days and has proposed the creation of a "rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take this position if accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalised.
There's no shortage of Israeli analysts who think things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a survey published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under the rotational leadership of Netanyahu and Gantz.
This solution is supported by 50.6% of Israelis, 32.1 percent of respondents object to this solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – the question of who should be the first to lead the cabinet, 41.8 percent of respondents are in favour of Netanyahu, and 40% are in favour of Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63%, 60% opposed to the new elections, which would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, Gantz won 33 seats in 120-seat Kneseta, Likud Netanyahu won 32 tickets.
Netanjah with his traditional and potential allies can count on 55 Members, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties collected the 61 mandates needed to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final match with the Australians.
Justin Tipuric says that “it’s time to check out” when Wales is facing the final match with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Wales over the "kangaroos" would put this team in the position of a certain favorite to win Group D and guarantee their participation in a possible quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be immediately sent off with England in one-eighth finals.
"Let's be clear, both teams want to try to get through it and be at the forefront of the group," said Welsh ripper Tipuric.
In the past there have been some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be anxious to take this victory away from us, and we're going to have to take it back.
By the time we got here, you knew this was gonna be a big fight.
And now we're here, and it's really time to prove ourselves.
Wales won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and this took place 32 years ago in a third place match when they defeated the "cangures".
And their total record under Chief Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven wins in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams in the Southern Hemisphere.
Wales has stopped a string of 13 failed test matches from Australia last November, and Tipuric has prepared to be among the few survivors of this win 9-6 who will run for Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced mental blockage before this victory, adding: “It is hard to say.
These games are so even that maybe... people are expecting some kind of mental block, I don't know.
In the end, in the last game we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks like a much smaller advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then the fight between Tipuric and the beloved Australian duo from the third line of Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial during the stop and downfall.
Tipuric played 67 matches in the colors of the team and met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's ahead.
"These are players playing in the seventh absolutely world-class position," he said.
When you play against the world-class players of the third line of the mill, you always know that it will be a difficult game to play.
These two are constantly performing with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you'd expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better rugby because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and challenge each other than to face the third line of a mill that is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and by struggling with these two, you certainly need to be in top shape.
I wouldn't say Sunday's almost the final of the cup, but for us it's an important game in this World Cup.
The momentum is an important element of it.
When we build strength and constantly put great effort, we will fly like wings and it will be hard to defeat us.

"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite "gentlemen's race" organization.
They accepted into their ranks those whom they despised.
Can a crime connect more than a national identity?
In your hands we present not another book on war or military subjects.
We are giving a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries analyse attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish troops differ from the French troops?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a branch made up of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative of European cooperation today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, the book "Waffen-SS" answers these questions on the basis of solid research material.
We sought to present a subtler and more balanced, more accurate picture of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of history by presenting trials by researchers from different countries. (...) While the fate of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, opponents of the political Nazi Germany, Slavic population - is sometimes presented in comparative and/or supranational terms, the perpetrators are generally examined from a national perspective (as far as this is done).
"Total panic" when the White House struggles to find arguments about impeachment
The White House officials struggle to figure out how to resist the pressures on impeachment resumed on Thursday, and one of the speakers familiar with the situation describes the sense of “total panic” felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This seems to exacerbate "anxiety, uncertainty and concern" – one of the people associated with the White House thus describes the mood in the western wing – that the informant's allegations could seriously harm the president and the people around him.
The person said, "There is no certainty that nothing is hidden there."
The White House officials were still insecure about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of effectively avoiding controversy used by the president in the past may not work. "This does not seem to pass away with the appearance of the next series of headlines" – the person made a joke.
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the atmosphere of the White House as a “shock” accompanied by growing mistrust that, with a protracted investigation into impeachment, the likelihood of the president responding irresponsiblely and becoming “difficult to control”.
This concern is shared by another interlocutor claiming that the people around the president expect him to be more "sustainable" and that the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase every day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way explode – it is in the context of the year of the election that concerns both the presidency and the election.
Faced with the biggest threat in the presidency so far, Trump circled from attack to defense, again reaching for a strategy that he assessed as effective in the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to trivialize his own request to the Ukrainian president to help investigate his political rivals in order to divert attention and direct it to the actions of the democrats and the Democratic candidate Joe Biden and discredit the informant as party-driven.
But while many people in the White House are trained in combat after the Mueller investigation, something has changed this time – said advisors and consultants.
The President, whose hallmark is strength, showed the press conference Wednesday as defeated – said one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed reluctant to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informant did not have firsthand knowledge of the controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski, which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as often happens when the president is under attack, this fact is raised alive by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House points out that the results of the polls of support for the President are extremely high, and the impeachment will not affect the acquisition of new sympathizers.
"There is nothing positive about the need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if this makes its legislative agenda difficult and predominates in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker says that those who claimed that the impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worried White House officials sought help from advisors by completing an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it is unclear whether any initiative in the style of a command centre will be taken and what form it may take.
This person stated that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a decisive leader able to launch a PR attack that is a repost to publish a virulent signal report and to stop democrats from moving forward with the impeachment given by the disclosure of the report.
A talker familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin declared that they were not going to disclose a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no way out and that the document had to be published.
It is now expected that the pressure will be greater than in the course of the investigation of Robert Mueller, who usually kept his silence and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in the preparation of the response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, the man from Trump's dirty work and the former chief of the election staff – said the person associated with the case.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will lead this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his program," he said, "but I have not been in any talks with the president or his team about joining the team to resist the false narrative of impeachment."
Donald Trump's private attorney from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
"We are responding to matters properly" Sekulow replied when he was asked by NBC News to comment.
Now the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, does not have this kind of experience.
A speaker familiar with the White House’s strategy stated that, in general, officials did not plan to involve people or create a command centre at any time, but admitted that there was a need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could lead a political struggle.
Excursion Explorer of the Seas Royal Caribbean line underwent renovation for 89 million pounds
The explorer of the Seas, a member of the Royal Caribbean International family, will take a cruise this summer, presenting a completely new look.
After a renewal that took on an impressive 110 million dollars (89 million pounds), the ship delights with a wide selection of culinary delicacies from around the world and a rich entertainment offer for the whole family.
This summer the Explorer will stay in the greatest ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to taste the Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land is over, the crew of the ship promises an unforgettable experience at sea.
Having a satisfactory offer for everyone, the Explorer, after a renovation of $110 million, or about £89 million, turned into a passenger ship that provides perfect entertainment for the whole family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surfing simulators or watch their favorite family film, using the charms of the weather, as part of an outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which enable passengers to admire the views of the ocean without the need to board.
Water lovers will delight the newly designed deck by the pool combining the style of the Caribbean resort with the charms of the water park.
The swimming pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and deckchairs ideal for lying in the sun, and two modernized slides are within reach of people who are thirsty for strong impressions on board.
The trip attractive to passengers of all ages impresses with the number of activities at guests' disposal when travelling to destinations.
Created for children, Adventure Ocean for children is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and the exclusive leisure space for teenagers offers super games and a music zone prepared for people over 12 years old.
If this proves insufficient, the whole family in the "Studio B" on the ship can compete in a laser tag game with the effect of glowing in the dark, which can also be impressively used as a skating rink.
During the Mediterranean cruise, guests will also have the opportunity to explore exotic flavors from all over the world, going to conquer restaurants on board.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on board in the restaurant Izumi, and the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen serves delicious food inspired by an innovative look at traditional Italian cuisine.
The rest of the catering facilities on board include the American restaurant serving Chops Grille, the Latina bar Boleros, Schooner Bar and the express bar Johnny Rockets.
The cruise, with the option of a seven- or nine-day tour, departs from Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship of the Royal Caribbean, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has also recently undergone an incredible renovation.
After the 58-day Allure metamorphosis, a total of $ 165 million, the cruise operator offered the guests who had made the reservation earlier, a $300 voucher to be released on board the ship.
The cruise operator said: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth ship of the Voyager class to undergo transformation in the modernisation of the Royal Amplified fleet."
The program, which requires investment of over $1 billion, covering 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unique attractions and gastronomic experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding "naked pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of California apparently can't stand the naked truth about President Donald Trump being investigated.
In his Thursday defense, he accused the Democrats of wanting naked pictures of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the Committee for the Intelligence of the House of Representatives, made this allegation during the preliminary statement during the hearing following a complaint by the whistleblower that Trump had asked Ukraine to assist in the initiation of an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque representation" of the left and their "media ace", before he said that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the negligee.
"Democrats in this committee negotiated with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to prosecute the President when they have their chance next year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimands, a political reporter at HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to... discover it.
Until now, only the Connecticut representative, Jim Himes, has responded, although we suspect that his response is a naked truth, which confirms the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' nudity comments referred to "certain more lewd and unconfirmed information", which probably appears in Steele's controversial files,
This is a notorious collection of charges against Trump, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele, indicating the likelihood of a tape that supposedly shows him looking at a urinating prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help to reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to elude renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that allows renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University in the Faculty of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
His laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fat waste such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels, as well as waste from other industries.
This technology is designed to imitate hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
“What our first generation technology has done,” Bressler said, “is [totally creating] hydrocarbons, which are identical molecules to diesel fuel.”
While this opens up new possibilities for the use of biofuels, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilize at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat for aircraft flying at high altitudes.
"The aviation fuel problem is a bit of a vicious circle," Bressler said.
It's actually less worth than diesel, but it has higher demands.
Bressler's lab is currently looking at two options for producing aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure the fuel's stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
Forge Hydrocarbons, founded by the University of Alberta, is working to commercialise the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, increase investment in renewables.
"They are able to imagine times when the situation may be reversed and a carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be a contingency plan.
Currently, Forge operates a pilot plant near the Waste Management Centre in Edmonton and recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin as an investment to support a $25 million production facility that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the assumed reduction in coal will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further reduction of coal.
“As a technology specialist,” Bressler said.
I have the task of developing options that allow informed decisions and many choices to be made."
SURVEILLANCE: Another cheating on your granddaughter
8 thousand zlotys and 750 euros lost a woman living in Zamość thinking she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday the son of a defrauded courtesan.
“A woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he'll go to jail.
In order to help her grandson she gave PLN 8,000 and EUR 750 to a fake police officer who came to her house", reports Asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubiło from the Zamość police force.
Police are looking for the perpetrator, and once again they call for caution:
‘Every call requesting financial assistance should be verified.
You should not act under the influence of emotion and in a hurry.
Let us remember that police officers do not ask for money and do not accept money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling emergency number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the dangers, let's talk about how cheaters work.
Let's ask for caution and not trust people who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alliance warns that in the event of the withdrawal of the British brexit, they are threatening ROOMS such as in Los Angeles, and he himself is calling for peace.
One of the chief cabinet ministers said yesterday evening that the country is in danger of "violent social unrest" if the original result is called into question by the outcome of the second referendum.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister's allies warned from his immediate surroundings that the country's population was threatened by social unrest on the scale of the protests of "yellow vests" in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a calming of moods during a heated argument about the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "submission".
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said “The Times”: “There have never been such protests in this country as demonstrations of “guilets jaunes” (“yellow vests”) or riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because it hasn't happened before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – using encrypted telephones, through which they can coordinate pickets, and to push people to protest enough unfriendly populist leaders.
The riots in Los Angeles broke out after a jury acquitted four white cops who beat up a black cabbie Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests – gilet jaunes – have been destroying the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the House of Commons and said that if the UK fails to leave the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people will vote and 66% of them will vote in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union, ten million citizens will remain unhappy," said the Minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their Member and who will not give up.
Much does not need to be seen soon on the street several tens of thousands of people.
One of the main cabinet ministers added that the country is in danger of "violent social unrest" if the outcome of the first referendum is called into question by the outcome of the second.
Johnson called for universal elections in which voters would decide the fate of the brexit.
According to reports, the Prime Minister is faced with the risk of mutiny of the cabinet wishing to lower the demands of the brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Hołownia, Czubówna and Krosny were delighted in Kraków.
We're behind Talk'N"Roll.
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (26 September) to 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding horizons, talking about ideas worth spreading and discussing together, which can be an impulse for further development.
This was the goal of the organisers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 extraordinary speakers to the stage, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among them people known from the media - Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The slogan of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and just around the creation of the future were the speeches of guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about how a brand that is built around us can influence our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the audience's perception of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if you want to create a future, and Chris Badura took on the subject of empathy in the era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help in career management and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right balance between work and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, who talked, among other things, about how from her perspective the teacher's profession in Poland has changed over the years.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that – thanks to the development of technology – today everyone can work with this profession.
However, he does not believe that, in the next few years, the speaker will be completely replaced by technology.
Right after it, Piotr Nabielec took on the problem of living in times of information overload, emotional overload, or overload in the matter of choice, giving the audience valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what the next industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, could lead to.
♪ She's fun to teach ♪ ♪ She's fun to teach ♪
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the magician, Daniel Onlyek, to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first entertained the audience with a pantonim and then – on the example of his own career – talked about how he tries to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Szymon Hołownia, emphasising the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that up to two minutes could radically change the situation and that it was necessary to be ready to use that time.
In addition, Hołownia shared his thoughts on the reality around us, recalling anecdotes that could have sparked a smile on the faces of the audience.
Then Adrian Tworuszka appeared on the stage, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
In conclusion, Marcin Słowiak, on the example of Rubik's cube, talked about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to the great commitment of the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all those who could not attend the event personally, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the system of the state, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the tri-division of power", writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, published on Thursday.
The "Legal Governments Instead of Rule of Law" report documents, among other things, changes in the justice system and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled “The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that in the years 2015-2019 there was the biggest regression in the field of human rights protection in Poland after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the system of the state, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of three divisions of power.
By adapting the right to political goals, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law", writes the HFPC experts.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the judiciary, independent institutions (such as public media or the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
"For the first time in the last four years and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to carry out particular party interests.
This translated into the ongoing crisis of the rule of law, and also to weaken the entire human rights protection system in Poland", emphasised attorney Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "a period of systemic changes both in the country" and "in the field of the protection of human rights".
Over the last four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 legislative acts that are crucial for the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without public consultation and despite the reservations of the legal community, the Ombudsman or international organisations", explained Małgorzata Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years are: "weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), disregarding binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and weakening the guarantee of the protection of human rights".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered "these situations in which the authorities did not react or directly ignored the occurrence of aggression".
Funding experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere of attacks against individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the state's activity in the field of rule of law is due to the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from entities governed by international law.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as the leader of democratic changes in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to responsibility for violation of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights", reads the report.
Brother of a Pakistani social media star with life imprisonment for a murder of honor
Women's rights experts claim that it is often difficult to investigate justice due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail and the blurring of matters in public awareness.
“It takes so long for people to forget,” says Farzana Bari, women’s rights defender and founder of the first gender department in Pakistan at the university, and adds that even the publicized murder of Baloch has been resolved for over three years.
Although reliable data are difficult to establish according to women's rights groups, the Pakistani Human Rights Committee in 2018 identified at least 300 cases of so-called honorary killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and a network that promotes awareness of crimes with honorary motives estimates that in Pakistan there is about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed every year worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, messages to the country are decreasing, because many migrants are settled outside Poland permanently – says Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
According to the latest Euro-Tax report, the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to over PLN 8.6 thousand in 2018, which means that they increased by almost PLN 1000, which is almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish economic migrants in the countries of the Union reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year before", we read.
Director of the Centre for Migration Research at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better at the international labour market, where they use various options available.
"There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who, in search of better conditions, move from country to country, as well as employees of international corporations", says the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, e.g. the UK and Germany.
"This is the most important in Germany in 2018, as the total earnings of Polish migrants increased by 11 percent (to nearly 27 billion PLN).
However, Poles made the most money in the Islands – almost PLN 35 billion", we read further.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic migrants does not decrease.
The Saxons in the West and the North of Europe (leading Norway) are often a chance for several times higher wages than in Poland.
"Even at the minimum rates in a given country, which for example in Germany is between EUR 9.5 and 11,7 per hour", says the journal.
"Rzeczpospolita" states that Poles stay not only because of higher earnings, but also because they settled abroad.
Many Poles grow roots abroad, which can also be seen from dwindling remittances to the country.
These last year's have been the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Chrościcki reminds us, with the extension of the period of stay abroad, a group of people transferring money to the country is decreasing and their amount is decreasing.
"Emigrants bring their loved ones together", we read in Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been prolonged by almost a month, and unprecedented rains are causing death due to the collapse of buildings and the rotting of many crops.
Usually in northern India, monsoon leaves at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon for decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unheard of – recently in Pune, a western India, Wednesday and Thursday heavy rains have resulted in the death of several people and the devastation caused by the collapse of buildings.
There was a flood of houses, people were walking through the streets in the water to the knees, which normally only happens during the monsoon apogee.
There was also much rainfall in cities like Kalkuta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
Many homes have been destroyed as a result of long - term rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand.
Monsun also started late.
Many areas lacked water, so farmers were preparing for a possible drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain isn't normal this time of year.
“My vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot,” says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of a delayed and late-ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, an essential component of Indian food.
Onion, for which it was usually necessary to pay 20 rupees (0,23 UK pound), now costs 80 rupees (about 1 British pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and festivals are also at risk.
Another big festival is Dasar's festival on 8 October, during which Hindus build huge puppets like comic books, depicting Ravana, a figure with a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the "Ramajana" epic.
The burning of Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's likeness was made of paper, if the monsoon continues, it is Ravana who will laugh last.
Implementation of the Agreement for the sale of shares of Energosynergia Technologie Sp. z o.o. in restructuring
On 27 September 2019 the Fund's bank account received the price for the sale of 26,843 shares in Energosynergia Technologie Sp. z o.o. in the restructuring of PLN 100 000.
Thus the ownership of these shares was transferred to INDOS S.A. with its registered office in Chorzów.
The agreement to sell the shares was executed in connection with the waiver of the other shareholders from the right of priority of the acquisition of the shares and as a result of the consent to the divestment by the shareholders to whom such entitlement was granted.

Doodle celebrates Google's 21st birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we look for answers to all the questions that bother us.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are some of the favourite categories of Polish search.
According to the giant's data, last year we were happy to ask, among others, "Where is the storm?", "How to make asparagus?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How to get rid of fruit flies?", "How to eat kaki?".
Today the search engine is celebrating its twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and in Poland as many as 96 percent of people use "Google uncle" – are greeted today by a special Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthday, showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the bottom right corner a digital date was printed – as in the photo from the 1990s.
Synchronising folder
The search was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Its name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol, which means the number ten raised to the hundredth power.
It was also intended to reflect the company’s intention to index as many websites as possible from the world’s Internet resources.
Google Search was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than methods of simply segregating results based on the frequency of occurrence of a given phrase.
At first, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages that link to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon afterwards launched the famous google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" contains information about the extremely accurate results of Google's search.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, conquest of subsequent markets and increasing the value of the company.
Already in June 2000, Google's URL index has more than a billion positions, which makes Page and Brin's work become the largest web search engine in the world.
Currently, the company established by Page and Brina is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So, is there any further scope for development?
"The mission of Google is to organize global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made great progress in this area, we still have a very long way to go to achieve this goal", Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland provided in an interview with "Newsweek".
Frequent exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that exposure to highly concentrated plant protection products may result in a high risk of heart ailments in later years of life.
This was the case with a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, who had been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
"This study highlights the need to use personal protective equipment for exposure to pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical records contact with such products at work, as well as controlling standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease" - said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results are based on data from more than 6000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in Kuakini Honolulu's cardiology programme.
According to scientists, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their health effects can become known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez said: "After 34 years of observation of men, it turned out that the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant".
This was probably because more important factors related to aging were becoming, which masked the possible causal relationship between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelenski-Trump phone call: Poroshenko throws in his three cents
Washington politics is having a turbulent week of impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump.
Getting involved in a political scandal is a situation for the political debutante Volodymyr Zelenski, whom he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first one?
Almost at the start of the telephone call, Trump told Zelenski that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes disclosed by the White House are not complete, they describe in detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader and other leaders of European countries are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy was aroused by Zelenski's reply, which stated that he agrees with Trump not 100%, but 100%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decide to speak through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU's support in the course of "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, among others the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?".
Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked Zelenski to investigate not one but two cases: the first one concerning Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and the second one relating to hacking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on Democratic e-mail boxes during the elections in 2016.
It is not known whether this will damage European relations or break relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to speak ill of anyone...
We thank all those who help us" – he stated after publishing the recording of the call made by Zelenski in New York during the General Assembly of the United Nations.
Zelenski is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the Normandy Four, which is to take place in October.
Former Provincial Inspector legally acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of the alleged acts.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of the charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Provincial Trade Quality Inspectorate of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, on the charge of exceeding the powers.
The Lublin prosecution accused him that he was going to tell the then Marshal of the voivodship the date of the inspection in the factory producing food oil.
A final acquittal has recently been given in this case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12.
‘The court has maintained the acquittal judgment under appeal,’ confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, spokesman for the Industrial District Court.
It is the judgment of 14 February this year issued by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on his Facebook account: "It has been six years since the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin presented me with the alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of Podkarpackie Province on 30 April 2012.
The court made it clear that I was innocent and that I did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Region was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of events which the media outlined in 2013 by the Appeals Prosecutor's Office in Lublin missed the truth and caused irreparable damage to both the food producer's entrepreneur and the loss of the image of my person in my employers, among employees and also in the local community.
The indictment that was made against me in the Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, unreliable statements of legal bases, unconfirmed events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszów, everything was being done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately fired from my job and deprived of funds.
I've been on my wife's back for a long time."
Let me remind you.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the Provincial Inspector of the Commercial Quality of Agri-Food Products in the years 2009-2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin presented charges to him in 2013.
According to the investigators, in the telephone conversation he was supposed to tell the former Marshal of the Province (Mirosław Karakit was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the term of the inspection in the factory producing food oil belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of Podkarpackie.
This warning – as the prosecutors from Lublin claimed – was supposed to make the owner of the company know about the control and correct the labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of breach of his rights, which threatened him for up to 3 years in prison.
“I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of which is a final judgment acquitting me from the charges against me", comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide the recording of the conversation with Zelenski
In a written report released on Thursday, the whistleblower wrote that President Donald Trump, when talking to the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenski, sought interference of a foreign state in the election in the USA, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, the whistleblower, who is probably an intelligence officer, wrote: "As part of my duties, I was informed by many members of the US government that the President was using his function to demand foreign interference in the election in 2020 in the United States".
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
Specifically, he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president re-election in 2020", says the report quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
The Ukrainian leader was “understanded” that his contacts with Trump depended on whether he “shows his will to play” in matters that he was to be informed more specifically by the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the interview, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its content by “many White House officials who had direct information about it” and that their relationship coincided.
"The following days after this conversation I learned from many American officials that the high-ranking representatives of the White House intervened to “seal” all the archive records concerning this conversation, and especially the literal record that was written, as is usually done, in the White House's crisis room", we read further.
“The high-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers “ordered them to” remove electronic records from the IT system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," wrote the author of the report.
"In my opinion, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation", the signaler said.
According to the AP Agency, this document will probably speed up the investigation of the president's impeachment, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this report.
The recording of the conversation with the Zelenski White House, after the pressures of Congress, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of electronic recording, but on the basis of the relationships of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in the edited version, was revealed the following day by the Committee of Intelligence of the House of Representatives.
Also on Thursday, acting director of American intelligence, Joseph Maguire testified before the Committee of Intelligence of the House of Representatives and explained how he treated the report of an intelligence officer.
Maguire said that the whistleblower made the right choice and acted as the law dictates.
He also stressed that in his opinion the matter of talking to Zelenski is an event "without precedent".
Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the signaler's report to Congress; the intelligence director replied that he did not have the power to disclose its content, whose confidential nature is guaranteed by the so-called privilege of executive authority.
Part of Maguire's hearing by the committee was behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, in view of the suspicion that the President was exerting pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she estimated that Trump's record of his conversation with Zelenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken the election and security standards.
The U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
On Thursday, White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts and press clippings."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and false narrative promoted by mainstream media", she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The security prize was awarded in recognition of Ghana's highest number of aviation safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent for the temporary rate of effective implementation (EI).
This was the case when ICAO completed its ICVM audit on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency’s Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme.
The security award was evidence of recognition of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO's standards and protocols for security at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The prize programme was designed to support an ICAO initiative called No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety and security certificates have been awarded to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and security standards and 17 in the field of security.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, General Director of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa was present.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, stressed the need for Member States to maintain safety in the airspace.
He stated "it is important that we keep reminding ourselves that, even in the age of innovation, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our primary priorities".
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the efforts of the state, as they were a compliment to the hard work and perseverance of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry has great potential for the development of the country’s economy, saying: “Aeronautics has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but they are all due to the security and security that we have achieved."
He was tanking and running, and he stole his bike.
A 50-year-old from the commune of Zamość drove his Audi under the distributor, tanked and drove away without paying.
That way, he robbed gas stations several times.
A man a month ago also stole a bicycle from one of the Zamość offices.
The owners of petrol stations valued losses on almost PLN 1,000.
Owner of the stolen bike – for PLN 2 thousand.
Last Tuesday, one of the Zamość districts noticed an Audi on Wyszyński Street, the owner of which was suspected of theft.
There's a wanted 50-year-old man behind the wheel.
A man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard allegations of stealing fuel from four gas stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
Uniforms also found the stolen bike.
The one-track will return to the owner soon.
A thief's theft is punishable by a sentence of imprisonment up to five years old.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who is the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when testifying at the Senate Budgetary Subcommittee on National Security on the FEMA budget proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Capitol Hill in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, who is the deputy manager of FEMA, is the head of the agency that oversees the government’s response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has been operating without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March, when Brock Long released this position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under FEMA stated that Long was misusing government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough examination of his past revealed allegations that he was in a bar fight.
Gaynor was expected to be nominated for this post.
To approve his nomination for this role, a majority in the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before Gaynor became deputy administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, is considering a finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized over a distance of 1500 metres, winning the gold medal of the 2012 European Championship (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the vice-master of Europe for 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new condition and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the 2016 Olympics, but the pains returned and in this season became very intense.
Pain makes me put my foot differently, which in turn changes my body system, there are other unnatural loads and I start to feel pain in other places, for example in my hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for the World Cup, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I have difficulty wearing spikes – said the runner on the TV channel NRK.
Gjert Ingebrigtsen's father and coach admitted that after long discussions with their son, they had come to the conclusion that the only way to keep him from finishing his career and participating in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be to amputate.
It seems that this is the only solution, although the drastic solution and the decision has already been made.
"If part of the body hurts, you should get rid of it, and Henrik doesn't really need that finger, and in this situation you should forget about the cosmetic aspect", he explained.
Police are closing an illegal e-cigarette factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed the illegal e-cigarette factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
The office building on 9600 Telstar Avenue was raided around 16:37, while the police were searching for illegal cannabis-containing e-cigarettes for sale and where large jars containing butane hashic oil – cannabis concentrate were found.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police Department, officers also found a device that was used to supplement the vapo.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The ordinary electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the ignition of these fumes, causing not only a fire, but also due to concentration, even an explosion" - he says.
"If there are many jars and the like in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could wipe out the entire complex.
A task force was called to the office building to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant so that illegal activity was detected.
Investigators are still trying to find out who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person started business here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products are not on the street, given the recent articles on the harmfulness of vaping.
“People don’t really know what products they buy,” says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This could be a threat to our community and children, so we always warn them against reaching for these things.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF decided to take a treatment for thrush
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate has reported that the medicine has been withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat moulds and oral yeast infections, Gram-positive infections.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product has been withdrawn due to a non-compliant quality specification of the smell of the product and a decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenowy Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Each month, the GIF issues on average several decisions to withdraw individual product series from the market.
A series of medicinal products that are stopped on the market in Poland can be re-introduced after proof of the safety of their use.
This is not possible if the medicine is withdrawn.
19 zł banknote – where to buy a collector's banknote of this denomination?
It bears 19 zlotys and bears the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October a new collector's banknote will be put into circulation – said Narodowy Bank Polski.
It's another "Independence" banknote.
It is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Security Printing Works.
As described in the NBP release, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the banknote, January 25, 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the establishment of PWPW falls.
Also nominal value, PLN 19, refers to the year of creation of the Factory" - we read in the NBP release.
The watermark represents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
New is the holographic stripe placed on the ground window.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription "independent" a stylized image of the Order of the White Eagle was presented.
This inscription, reproduced from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is a logotype of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of regaining independence by Poland.
In the branch of Lorenzo, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angular effect was incorporated.
On the reverse side of the banknote there is an image of the factory building against the background of the panorama of contemporary Warsaw.
Next to it is built into the PWPW logotype SPARK Live protection and the opalizing strap, visible also in UV light in the form of repeated numbers "19" and abbreviation "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is expected to enter circulation on October 2 with up to 55 thousand units.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from special series, are legal tender in Poland.
However, their nominal value is much higher than that which can be achieved on the collector's market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, over two million, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded onto the barge.
That's where he swam 50 miles from here.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
PiS President Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosieńska in the upcoming elections.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński together with Małgorzata Gosieńska posed for the photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw's "three" boasted on social media that she would gain Kaczyński's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosieńska", we read on her Facebook page.
The head of the party pointed out that he is a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to provide help.
"I will cast my vote for Małgorzata Gosieńska and ask the same thing," she calls.
Gosiewska is a candidate for the Sejm from the district of 19. (Warsaw) and from the third place on the list.
The "One" is Kaczyński himself, and the second place is Mariusz Kamiński.
Here comes the Christmas Book Fair.
Meetings with popular writers and books are ahead of us at exceptional prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
People in Podkarpacie are told they don't read books.
We'll show that it's different," said Marta Heltorak at the press conference.
And who will support reading in Rzeszów this year?
As we heard, Sister Anastasia will appear at the fair, called the first cook of the Republic, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn in Millennium Hall there will be a great cultural event – on 22 and 23 November the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fair will be held in the shopping centre, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and bookkeeping offices from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be as many as 30 of them, including Agora, Sign, SQN, PWN and Black.
At their positions they will present their wide offer of publishing and hundreds of novelties, which participants of the fair will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, authors were invited to write about important issues and are not afraid to take on difficult topics, and they are also winners of prestigious awards and... they cook great.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, Łukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the policy passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best-selling "Loneliness in the Network", and the queen of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be Anastasia's sister, the author of several books (including cooks), which have sold over 4 million copies.
The exhibition of the lost dress of Elizabeth I at the Hampton Court Palace
The silver threaded dress made of the finest silk chamlot was craftyly decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Elera Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces exhibition, that meant only one thing.
The faded fabric that had been hanging for 100 years on the wall of a tiny village parish church, which she was looking at, could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn accidentally stumbled upon an lavish altar cloth in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's missing dress is due to go to an exhibition next month at Hampton Court Palace, close to the same rooms where the Tudor Queen could wear it over 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that only one more element of the 16th century dress survived from the entire collection of royal dresses.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silver", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the clothing belonged to the most outstanding of people.
The dress, when it was made, could have cost the equivalent of the Tudor mansion.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, or at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt a threat from other women outside and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fine fabrics," says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the community to look at the dress.
I was really glad that when they saw the dress, they also loved it and were practically convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long life of the dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the closest to Elizabeth, was a lady of the court who served the Queen for her long life and with which the local legends identified the fabric.
Although the dress was made after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parra family or parish in memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, of which four hundred have passed on the most delicate manual sewing with specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will be placed at the exhibition next to the portrait of "Rainbow Portrait" borrowed at the time of the exhibition by Hatfield House, one of the most famous paintings of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"When working with historical fabrics, it really begins to respect the craftsmanship of the people who made them," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation works, most of which took place in a converted greenhouse in Hampton Court Palace, the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapestrys.
“Looking at the embroidery from the front and the back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" exhibition will start on October 12 at Hampton Court Palace
Fitch has confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
The Fitch Agency confirmed on Friday a long-term foreign currency rating of Poland at the level of "A-", as stated in the Communication.
The rating outlook remains stable.
"The Fitch agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-diversified economy, which is supported by sound economic policies and strong banking sector", says the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the business cycle, and in the years 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
The Agency expects the general government deficit to remain below the 3 percent threshold between 2020 and 2021, 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.
"The debt ratio of the government and local government sector to GDP in 2019 is 50,5 per cent by the agency and will be lower in the following years (on average 48,3 per cent between 2020 and 2021)", we read.
Polish Rating
On 11 October, S&P and Moody's will conclude the autumn round of the Polish rating reviews.
Poland's rating in Fitch's assessment remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time the agency confirmed Poland's "A-" rating with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Moody's is the highest rated credit rating on the level "A2".
Polish rating according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects of all evaluations are stable.
What is a rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to assist investors in assessing the risk scale of their investment activities.
Rating is awarded to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit assessment.
On the basis of this, decisions are made about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests that it is best not to give any credit at all, because there is a high risk that the money will not be recovered.
A lower rating involves a higher risk.
A higher risk is a high interest rate on credit.
Each assessment must be justified and certified.
The ratings can be manipulated, but in this case the agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global market for rating services is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own evaluation system.
Confederation's Friday: First of all, 1000 plus
The Fifth Confederation, the main elements of the electoral programme, was presented on Friday in Koszalin by candidates for the Sejm from the district of 40 who were applying for a mandate from the KW list of the Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Koszalinska list to the Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the slogans of the "fives of the Confederation".
"First, the program 1000 plus for Poland, second, quick and fair courts, third, cultural voucher and educational voucher, fourth, national security, fifth, that is healthy life", said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "Poles must finally earn a decent income", which is why the Confederation wants to liquidate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the tax-free problem will be solved itself".
"Poles need to be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all", said the leader of the list about the assumptions of "program 1000 plus for Poland".
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadencka, who started from the second place of the list, referring to the program's slogan "healthy life", said that "food is increasingly poorer and in order to change it, we should "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", act for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederation also advocates the cessation of "stigmatisation of hemp".
Zadencka declared support to the Confederation for the "development of construction using natural resources".
She also said on behalf of her group for “voluntary vaccination”.
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
Another candidates to the Sejm from the Koszalin district stressed that the Confederation is in favour of "the implementation of a deep reform of the judiciary", which would include the judge's consideration of the case "day after day".
They also argued that education subsidies should go to schools without intermediation of local authorities, i.e. without additional costs associated with the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also in favour of "a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
According to them, we also need easier access to weapons.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gasify coal, we have large deposits of geothermal energy, we also need to consider a return to the idea of a nuclear power plant", said Piotr Karpiński on the fifth electoral list.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind a third of the drugs in the U.S.
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported a morning drug chase.
Brian McKnight of the DEA showed what was going on.
Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died of a drug overdose.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA is focused on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, simply known as El Mencho.
"He is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for federal executives in the United States", said Matthew Donahue, the chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The prize for El Mencho goes up to $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of drugs entering the United States by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
There's a $10 million reward for El Mencho's head.
Ironically, about 30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created the violent cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, 50-caliber weapons.
He basically has his own SWAT teams," added Donahue.
El Mencho unpunishedly protects his empire by using such measures as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab, a package of cocaine is called a smuggler's brand.
For more than a third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone's kid dies, Donahue says there's a "big chance" that drugs come from El Mencho.
Last year, over 67,000 Americans died of an overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the French President and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady," claims the French prosecutor.
The defendant assures us that he has documents compromising the president's couple.
He demanded from the head of state, among others, 300 thousand euro in the cookers.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work for the police in France claims to have received “exploded” documents from a person employed at the Elysian Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the president's couple, but that disclosure of them in their entirety could even jeopardise the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return he demanded 300,000 euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macro's daughters from a previous marriage.
According to the D.A.'s office, the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would give it to the media – but for now it is not known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during a search at that 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to a psychiatric examination, but the doctors did not find any serious disorder in him.
PS4 will be an old-school game – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the soon-to-be debuting game available exclusively on the PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, as part of a recent presentation by the State of Play, announced that the sequel to The Last of Us will be premiered in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
More details were revealed in the days after the loud premiere of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog go back to old-school climates in a lot of ways.
The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in an excellent interview given to The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The story is ambitious and complicated in aspects where the one was not" - he said.
It had to be so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the widest game, it just happened.
"There will be moments when you think that you are going to end, but you will realize that this is just the beginning and that a completely new chapter is beginning," Druckmann continues.
It's such an ambitious game that it doesn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
At another point, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggi with adult content (information provided by Gamestpot).
We will not spoil the surprise, but the appearing in the game of easter eggi refer to the old-school works of Naughty Dog.
You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on PS4 on 21 February 2020.
People with PS4 can prepare for the launch of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered by PlayStation Plus since October 2019, including the above mentioned production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to pre-order for a sequel, Sony has stated that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelets and a 30-centimeter figure of this iconic character.
Run, jerk and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the first-class Stomil will take Podbeskid and want to win.
Stomil players from three lines are undefeated.
Piotr Zajączkowski's subjects scored seven points at that time, because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match a goalless draw in Suwałki fell.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 6 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites for the promotion to Ekstraklasa.
Stomil's closest rivals take fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the Olsztyn team.
Podbeskid played six times this season and scored two wins, draws and defeats While Stomil feels very good at his facility – at the stadium at al. Piłsudskiego 69a the team of Piotr Zajączkowski won three times and lost once.
In total, in ten queues, the alschtynians collected 17 points and are at the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the competition, nothing announced it.
“Every change takes time to produce results,” explains Piotr Skiba.
"And finally, we got something, we believed in each other, and we can work under normal conditions.
All we've been focusing on is playing ball.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil players eliminated the Polish Movement of Chorzów from the Polish Cup, but they needed overtime and a series of penalty throws.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because coach Zajączkowski gave rest to these key players before Saturday's fight with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, Jakub Mosakowski, who returned after the injury, played in Chorzów, who finally scored his long-awaited goal.
“It’s always fun to score a goal, and I’m still at a point where we can continue to play in the cups (Mosakowski evened at 3:3 in the 119th minute - red).
My dad used to tease me a lot and laugh that I couldn't get the goal, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he wasn't expecting it."
Now Mosakowski hopes to return to the basic composition, especially because of yellow cards he cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
"That's why I run hard at practice so I can play in the first line up," says Mosakowski.
“In Chorzów, I did everything I could to present myself to the best of my ability.
However, whether I play or sit on the bench, I will support the team as much as I do.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
Surely we will have a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run out, pluck and fight."
Rafał Remisz, who recently also suffered injury, can still play in the middle of the Olsztyn defense, so whether he will perform, we will learn only on Saturday, especially as Coach Zajączkowski traditionally tries to keep the staff matters secret until the end.
A man raped and murdered his niece.
“You will never see the light of day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated where the body was hidden.
"How could someone do this to their niece?" asked Dejay Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," he said to Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to see her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our lives will never be the same again," added the devastated woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted he kidnapped, sexually abused, and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said that his client was raised in an "imperfect family".
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to be punished.
A man was sentenced to life without parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would hand over nearly $100 million of additional funds to the drought-stricken communities.
The scheme providing money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for allocating farm allowances will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million for the initiative to support the communities affected by drought, so that eligible farms can receive up to $3,000 in an emergency.
Each of the 13 local government areas under the Drought Communities Assistance Programme will receive up to $1 million of infrastructure subsidies and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to over $7 billion allocated by the government to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
Documentary: In China, the number of divorces has doubled in the last decade.
In general, third parties were the cause of this.
More and more men maintain an extramarital relationship, which has led to the development of a particular industry in this country – professional slayers of lovers who are meant to save the marriages of cheating wives.
Let's chant out loud, Ma-te-u!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister to Piekary Śląskie
A private general rehearsal was conducted before the electoral meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekary Śląskie.
"Dearly beloved, louder, louder, this way we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's chant out loud: Ma-te-u!", encouraged the leader.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic gerrey did not produce the desired result.
Election campaign in progress.
Politicians travel all over the country, convincing voters.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also runs an intensive campaign, which as the leader of the Silesian List of Law and Justice is a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including the appropriate setting.
This was also the case, or rather – it was supposed to be, in Piekary Śląskie.
You know – special guest should be especially greeted.
Before the meeting with the Prime Minister, the President of the Chamber decided to hold a general test.
Like a dry leader, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of the government.
"This will not be a welcome to me, but to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, my friends!", encouraged the enthusiastic.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not allow themselves to be fully kidnapped by the lead instigators and reluctantly answered "Ma-te-us", but the recording of the enthusiastic conductor makes a big deal on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the residence of the Stays on 9 July 2014, demanding the release of his wife, Melanie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys 13 and 4 and two girls 9 and 7 died when Haskell opened fire, according to Harris County Sheriff's Department.
Only one family member, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she recovered completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.
The jury will reconvene on Monday to issue a verdict.
Quantum Internet Getting Closer to Reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army research are pushing the quantum Internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of maintenance not available with a traditional approach to networking.
The Center for Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the Capacities of Combating the American Army was watched by researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of a state tangled between matter and light – 50 kilometres away with fiber optic cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as cubs.
When two cubs are tangled up and measured on one of them, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the other cub is physically distant.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows further away than was possible, and this is a feasible distance to the beginning of the construction of intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and a major researcher in the project, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, the Quantum Information section.
The long-distance quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of the physical networks of the cubites, which are intertwined despite the long physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dissipation of the confused state is essential for the creation of the quantum Internet.
"This demonstration is a big step forward in order to achieve a dissipated state of confusion on a large scale", said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-managing the military programme to support this research.
The quality of the confused state at the other end after the fibre travel is also high enough to meet some of the most demanding applications of quantum networks.
The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, researchers entered the quantum state into the ion, at the same time stimulating it to emit photon in which quantum information was stored.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were tangled.
The challenge is to send photon to the fiber optic cable.
"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the fiber optics," Lanyon said.
Therefore, his team initially sent a particle of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The wavelength of the photon has been converted into an optimal value from the point of view of transmission to long distances – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-kilometer fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and the particles of light were still tangled even after the wavelength had been transformed and the distance had passed.
"The choice of calcium means that this result sets a direct path for the creation of a tangled network of atomic clocks at long physical distances, because calcium can be co-imprisoned with a high-quality cup of "gar".
The army is very interested in tangled clock networks built on a large scale due to applications concerning precise positioning, precise navigation and timing," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
