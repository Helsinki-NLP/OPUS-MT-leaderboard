Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
Among some of the members of the National Assembly, there was a dismay. This is the result of a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament.
The idea was created in connection with plans to replace the assembly with the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can be mocked.
One Labour MP expressed concerns about his group, saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means feces.
One Plaid Cymru party politician stated that his group was "dissatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name. However, he pointed out that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The assembly committee, which is currently working on a bill amending the name, took the following position: "Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the conversion of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the assembly to the "Wales Member of Parliament", that is, the WMP in English, although the term "MWP" was the most popular among the public.
Members of the assembly offer alternative solutions. The difficulty of reaching consensus is a nuisance to Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, who should present a bill in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules for recalling members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the bill.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
In the next Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be named the Republic of North Macedonia.
A popular vote is intended to help put an end to a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that the change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells at St. Martin's New York church are silent over problems affecting churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at the moment".
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Currently, people are socializing in a different way," he noted.
"Bars have ceased to be a place of regular community meeting".
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that funds from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that "they will be at the starting point sooner or later".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the remaining surrounding temples.
As he said, "The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be of a white race. This will speed up the complete closure of churches as it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes."
Both churches were built by a gathering of white believers, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Martin joined the community a decade later).
The original White Methodist assembly left the district in the 1930s.
At that time, the African - American assembly took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the assembly led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against traders from 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the hiring or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, however John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell band.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carolion "the bells of the poor."
The expert, who rang the bells in July, described them in a different way, as "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carol in the world served by black music. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's church did not replace him.
In recent months there have been a number of complicated events involving architects and performers in St. Martin's Church. Some of them were brought to the place by secular church leaders and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a body managing a parish made up of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it "wants to transfer costs to the council", although the council did not participate in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the season for lobsters.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they approached the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he thought the boy was excited about catching a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!".
Upon reaching the site of the event, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin in the area of the clavicle.
“I started shouting to everyone to flee the water: “There is a shark in the water!” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The shark species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
In order to conduct the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's chain of shops plans to expand its business in the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws a glove to stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetic departments to its supermarkets referring style to department stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion and household industries, 11 stores belonging to the network will have larger shelves with cosmetic products. If the initiative is successful next year, the actions will be extended to further points.
The turn towards the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways of planning the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 articles. The assortment will first include goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees products will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its portfolio of Boutique make-up products. From now on, most articles will be vegan friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, perfume seller Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The universality of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets would increasingly resemble commodity houses because the network is trying to fight off discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's put Argos points in hundreds of stores and introduces a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing the sales of foodstuffs and increasing the profitability of investments.
The previous attempt to reorganise the departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals resulted in a failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots to try out. However, the cooperation ended following the conflict over the division of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four chain stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all the needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way we shop to date".
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den television show, was "angry" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was about to withdraw from the £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
A sudden decision to leave the successful lifestyle brand and focus on a new collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV made by Holly Willoughby enraged Peter Jones, star of the Dragons' Den show.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "angry" when a popular television presenter announced during a Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million he would not have time to devote himself to their brand offering accessories and household items Truly.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand. It was also expected to double Holly Willoughby's property estimated at £11 million.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave the True brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left Britain, going to one of his summer homes.
“ True’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby, ” reports the source.
She had a future with her and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all the persons involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In the Marlow Warehouse, goods are overdue for sale".
Experts believe that the resignation of presenter This Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows through candles to clothing and household items – as well as lead to a further delay in market entry.
It can also mean the end of long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship for ten years with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couples spent vacations together, and Jones included 40% of the share in the television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is expected to become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program at ITV station.
A source similar to Peter Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president was joking about the criticism of the media caused by the remark made, which some considered to be "an unattainable statesman", as well as a positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see an "analogous response" from the United States to early North Korea's efforts to disarm.
He noted that instead the United States maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un have brought positive results: they led to the conclusion of missile trials, helped free the hostages and returned the remaining American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach while discussing a relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to behave after the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a crowded stadium we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered directly in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of shelter by more than 10% of the residents of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition to accelerate the action of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not demanding international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain that international personnel will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
Faced with the constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh Province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu – despite issuing a warning – probably affected the number of fatalities.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is heading for the relief of earthquake victims to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and allocated a lot of funding to roads and railway lines.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration faces a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to ongoing religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died and tens of thousands of residents lost their homes as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.

The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
According to the Indonesian disaster agency on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country increased to 832.

Cromwell Memorial in front of the British Parliament last victim in the dispute over "writing history again"
Removing the monument would bring justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society described Jeremy Cricket's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Regarding the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell at Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The outrageous actions during the English civil wars were neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas the age had previously been decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell at the memorial shows how much this politician enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many people he is a figure that is still worth commemorating.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than at present – as the Parliament's defender against external pressures.
An assessment of how accurate this statement is is is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
On the other hand, it is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated".
In China, a pig fatally mauled a farmer
According to local media, a fatal attack on a farmer occurred at a market in the southwest of China.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloody and with a severed artery near a pigsty at a market site in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kuwait.
A pig farmer is preparing to perform vaccination in a pigsty, 30 May 2005, the town of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring Junnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of a man and noticed the open door to the nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on its face.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a nearly 250-kilogram pig that killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
On the surveillance footage, Yuan arrived at the market Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that for the time of the gathering of evidence by the police, the pig was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
There have been cases of pig attacks on humans before, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier in Wales, a 300-pound pig pinned a farmer to a tractor, and a man's wife managed to draw the animal away.
After eating a Oregon farmer by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told the CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, however the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa remains will cause intense rainfall in the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength by moving over cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa winds at a speed of nearly 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern Time, it was given a category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
According to the forecast, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of humid air northwards, to the southwest United States.
On Monday, it will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in the part of the Mexican territory.
In the following days, humid tropical air entering contact with the approaching thanem will cause heavy rainfall in the South West USA.
In some areas of rainfall between 2.5 and 10 cm in height will lead to sudden floods, the movement of pollutants and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even between 5 and 10 cm of rain is predicted in some parts of the Southwest of the United States, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical precipitation, sudden flooding and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is definitely not possible to walk in the desert.
The abundant rains can turn the canyons into a storm of rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusts of wind and displacement of dust.
Approaching than will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small movements of pollution and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. Monday afternoon and Tuesday precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur, but in the intertropical zone it will be warm.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example are the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri State) and Omaha (Nebraska State) and between St. Louis (Missouri State) and Des Moines (Iowa State) these differences are nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
The temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the North East.
On Tuesday in New York City, the temperature can reach a value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, or about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of overaverage temperatures occurring in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's auditions
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations discussing Thursday's hearing of a candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment occurring in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political stalemate on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly broadcast programs to inform of the sudden recovery: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a weekly prosecution investigation.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was groping her intoxicated and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional statement, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that Friday's number of viewers was even higher than the 20.4 million Nielsen company reported.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television stations.
However, figures were not yet available for other stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen tends to have difficulty measuring audiences among people in the workplace.
The given number is similar to the American football cup ratings or awards of the American Film Academy.
According to reports, Nielsen Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings of an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest in the subject remained high at the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure of Friday events.
In the morning, he was captured by the cameras of CNN and CBS stations after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the recording he yells at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on his way to the hearing of the judiciary committee.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN station.
"I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have the strength to face the infirmity of so many women" — he heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the committee hearing.
Later on, television stations continued to broadcast events pending a vote on passing Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew that the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, as the minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was persuaded in part to talk to his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview given to the weekly Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and questioning the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham (UK), 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside this portrayal of Theresa May on the title page, the former Foreign Minister in her government Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU could collect duties on their behalf, calling it "totally ridiculous".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player appearing in the colors of Louisiana State University (LSU).
According to reports from Baton Rouge Police Station, a 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was detained and placed in custody on suspicion of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a CBS-related WAFB station, police officers found these glasses at the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
Police reported after questioning Simpson that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
As the detainee's lawyer handed over, the amount of bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner's office released a preliminary report according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department expressed its thanks to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and nearby residents for helping with the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU sports director, thanked local law enforcement authorities for "working hard and pursuing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A man measuring 198 cm grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his final season he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disgusted" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is one of the things we are constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexican people to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center noted numerous bumps and shocks.
Photos published on social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico's districts, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano also known as Don Goyo has remained active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes of demonstrators supporting the independence of Catalonia with police preventive troops. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme emotion of the referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separation supporters threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust swept the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also occurred in the later part of the day. In order to stop the fighting, police forces used sticks.
For several hours, groups supporting independence chanted "We don't forget, we don't forgive" while opponents of the secession shouted "May Spain live".
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance due to minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, tensions have not slowed down. Although the Madrid authorities have declared them illegal, it is still a reason for celebration for the desired secession of Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, but the turnout was low due to the wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting at polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the region's independence decided to prevent a demonstration of supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope of Catalan independence anymore.
"Last year we experienced some of the most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck at a no-win point," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty continuing their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic recording a phone-backed protest supporting police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute fuel conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his willingness to launch in next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Candidate in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested in the wake of a multiple car hit a house in the city of Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 a.m. British Time (BST).
Chief of Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point a crossbow shot could also be fired towards the car.
Menga Gate ensures Livingston win over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
As of this season, the Livingston club has driven the Rangers into a daze, causing Steven Gerrard only a second defeat in his 18 games as club coach from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's gate turned out to be the winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table occupied with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains this season with no victory at the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the Hearts leader, to whom he loses eight points.
Earlier, as early as Thursday, the Rangers will be hosting their Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League.
Livingston extends a series of wins in his division to six games. Coach Holt has not experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miler as a position last month.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against indisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and fired the goal light, but failed to score the goal. Alan Lithgow then missed after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during the fixed portions of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal came down.
After the Rangers threw a free throw, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the Mende situation that scored a goal from the middle of the penalty field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, however they could not force the host's defense and did not cause much trouble to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos took one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal light from another permanent passage judged in favour of Livingston.
The Rangers continued the attacks in Livingston's penalty field, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty throws after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton's replacement and one hand play. In both cases, however, the rivals' grudges were rejected.
"Fenomenal" performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played a great game, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their return to the extraclass. However, we should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to play.
This match had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organised defense. Menga, however, made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they have great moments under Gerrard's leadership, in this match they did not uphold their standards.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once we managed to get through the host defense. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany. The visits aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union have led to disputes.
After the meeting Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This town has the largest number of Turks outside its homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt politics in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divisions caused by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died from car collision
The cyclist suffered death after a collision with a car in London.
An accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 British time (BST).
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle and paramedics arrived, despite the intervention, a man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, there was another fatal accident involving a cyclist on Childers Street (about a mile [1.5 km] from the site of the Saturday accident).
Metropolitan police have reported officers working to identify the deceased man and report the incident of family members.
Roads were closed and bus detours were organized, and drivers were instructed to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six officers were injured by riots
According to the authorities of the facility, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a men's detention facility with a higher level of security.
Riots at HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire began on Sunday around 9:30 British time (BST) and continue.
To riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant, a special unit "Tornado" was called upon.
Officers on the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
The company’s spokesman said: “Specially trained staff were involved in the HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our establishments. We are convinced that responsible persons will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the plant had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention troops were called to the plant due to a dangerous riot in which workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona, likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remains of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the South West, causing a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service Agency has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, on Tuesday Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. Monday afternoon the rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from Arizona state border".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast rainfall of 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm in height.
In the remaining desert areas of the South West – including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the precipitation is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside areas at risk of sudden flooding associated with Hurricane Rosa may be relieved because the region has been facing drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought conditions prevail.
U.S. Drrought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona's area faces severe droughts belonging to the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is now located at a distance of 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, resulting in its weakening.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
Weather.com reported that "the area from the California Peninsula to the northwest of the state of Sonora is expected to fall from 7 to 15 cm in height, although it can reach 25 cm".
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico northward in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early mornings, it will arrive at the Arizona state border as tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will travel to the southern part of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is a very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwest of the state of Sonora and in the southwest desert areas of the United States," states the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause life - threatening sudden flooding and pollution in the desert and mudslides in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested in attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, about 4:00 a.m. British time (BST).
The victim was transported to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, one 17-year-old, two eighteen-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
Officers are requesting contact with all persons who have footage of the incident.
Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh had "feared evil and anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote devoted to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous Democratic Party's conduct," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had "feared the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the congressional, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford's accusations, a woman claiming that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault on her.
Ford also testified during a hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans could see Kavanaugh's brilliance, class and courage."
"A voice devoted to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of support from one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, an expert in the law on great merits for the community," he stated in front of a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not explicitly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the half-presidential election.
“We are five weeks apart from the most important choices in our lives.
I am not in this election, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting for our great candidates."
Trump claims that Democrats are practicing a policy of "resistance and obstruction of activity".
As the CNN station said one of the assistants of the important Republican Party policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia.
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed – many of whom were kidnapped by high waves crashing into the beaches – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that invaded the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to participate in the festival held in the city. At dusk, waves hit the shore reaching up to 6 metres high, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When there was a threat yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to tsunami," he said at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency for natural disasters of the BNPD.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, kidnapping cars, logs, and homes,” reported Nugroho, adding that before reaching the shoreline, the element was moving at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city suffered secondary shocks.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy liberated by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the nuclear bomb energy dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that fatalities and damage could be larger along the shoreline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communications "were completely paralyzed", so there are no reports from Donggala Province.
“There are over 300 000 people living there,” read the Red Cross statement, adding that the workers and volunteers of the organization go to the places affected by the disaster.
"We can talk about tragedy now, although the situation may deteriorate considerably," says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to a lack of information about the tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities reported that the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video made available on social media shows a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about the upcoming tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall crashed to the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military began sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, however, people evacuated still very much need food and other basic necessities.
The airport located in the city opened exclusively for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is to visit centres for people evacuated in Palu.
Over 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseb T. Sinay, World Vision's national director, the staff of this organization arrived safely from Donggala Province to the city of Palu and found shelter in tents from the tarp placed in the courtyard of the office. Along the way, the workers passed many desolate areas.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to provide help, there have been criticisms that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, receiving funding, resources and staff from abroad can only be started after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start taking international aid, but this has not yet happened".
After two days of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders participating in the Asian Games completed this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandono told how, within hours of the arrival of information paragliders among the community about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages via the WhatsApp communicator to athletes attending the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing cash at the ATM at Newport mall on the Levee
According to a Newport police station's announcement, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning, who was replenishing cash at a Newport on the Levee mall.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published release.
Another man "runs from behind to a Brink employee" and steals a bag of cash to an ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police didn't tell us how many people were involved in the robbery.
All persons with information on the identity of thieves are asked to contact the Newport police station at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "A person previously known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old musician has used the alias Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before a visit to Saturday Night Live. During the performance, the artist is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who according to the creators resigned from participation "for emotional reasons".
West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but a religious significance.
“I think “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “You”, West said earlier in the year, discussing the album's title with a radio presenter called Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs known by the nicknames Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former associate, also wrote his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and capital letters.
Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the student demonstration, Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, in the Square of the Three Cultures of López Obrador promised "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire in the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance to learners as well as creating more free public colleges.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert on artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, with the increase in Chinese activity in this area, the United States should double its research expenditure in the field of SI.
This comment is related to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan to become the most innovative state in the area of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"First, the budget for research on SI needs to be doubled: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview given this week, CNBC also said that doubling funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Senovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of the most significant companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system that defeated the best then American player in the Othello game. He then held a management position in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of earlier technological initiatives of the American government, e.g. organized by the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Area (DARPA) of the competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the struggles, as he thought it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to try very hard to receive government subsidies.
"China is not the one taking away the best representatives of the academic community, but the corporations," said Lee.
For several years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to develop SI.
"I believe that people who are involved in artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctor's degree should automatically admit a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the American National Science Foundation and other government organizations that grant funds to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In the earlier period of that year, the United States Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science, while the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced that US$2 billion had been allocated to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over US$100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to create a national committee on the security of artificial intelligence has not moved a step forward in months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This movement would allow a ten-year dispute with Greece to be resolved, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory and has therefore vetoed the accession of the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said he would not participate in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether attendance would reach the minimum level of 50% required to declare the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young people in Macedonia could live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us all with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
A change of name requires the support of two thirds of the members of parliament.
The state electoral committee reported that no unusual events had been reported by 13 o'clock.
However, attendance at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary election. At that time 66% of the eligible people voted.
"I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, a Skopje voter.
On 30 September 2018, in the town of Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name to open the way to membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents spread by the boycotting people of the referendum.
"We support membership of NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with a head high rather than a back door," Kawardarkow said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, with unemployment rates of more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will advocate a change of name in a referendum, as 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after giving his vote.
He stated that the "yes" vote was a "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required attendance.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in a Sunday referendum.
70% of those surveyed said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, attendance must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government policy since taking power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home in a Saturday meeting ended with a 2:0 result for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The gate captured by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with a midfielder to the Argentine striker.
The footballer outbid three Brighton defenders.
Aguero then found himself among four Brighton players.
He first played one of them, and then overtakes the others and finds himself at the edge of Brighton's penalty field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for it.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in a penalty field that defeated goalkeeper Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the goal.
"Aguero faces foot injury," said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about how to play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, Sterling provided the blue first lead in a duel in the Premier League.
The gate in question fell in the 29th minute.
In the action of this Aguero he received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to a far pole.
Manchester City's attacker pointed the ball to the grid just before it fell on the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will be held at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the chances of the Rockies winning.
After the loss of a chance to participate in the play-off phase by the Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to perform in the first lineup.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to appear in a Sunday meeting against the Colorado Rockies, as long as the Rockies retain a chance to perform in the play-off phase. Currently the team has one victory more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to win their first divisional champion title.
“Despite playing “for nothing”, at least we will go out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to be in this meeting?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for the Sunday meeting. However, the team tends to put Scherzer in the first lineup.
It would be the thirty-fourth performance of Scherzer in the first line-up. The player took part in Thursday's pitch training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher of the Washington team scores 18–7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated batters and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds during the season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Trump did not explicitly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the half-presidentship of the election.
"In November, we put all our achievements on the line.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running, I remain very active. I am constantly defending our excellent candidates," he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, mean and mean.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control.
As he said, Democrats carry out the mission of "resistance and obstruction of activity".
"It has been very good to see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad, malicious, unpleasant and untrue."
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Committee, recalling by name the American Senator from the Danne Feinstein Democratic Party, what happened to the loud buzz on the part of the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak of the document?
«Uh, hello?
No... I mean... no». Her body speech was terrible. It was the worst body speech I had ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those who express their own opinions
When Momentum activists in my party voted to reprimand me, I was not surprised.
At the end of the day, I am a member of a group of Labour MPs who has recently been told that they are not welcome, and all this is because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion for reprimand resulted from a disagreement between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
Friday's announcement of the Labour Party parliamentarians meeting from Nottingham East district read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I have been a Labour Party MP for most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now going on differently, and the promise of a "heartier and milder" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views, each opinion being assessed in terms of compliance with the party's leadership.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took the position of President, and the colleagues who seemed to me that we had similar views began to expect me to change direction and take positions with which I would not agree before, and they concerned issues such as national security or the EU's single market.
After every public speech – regardless of content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for the removal of nominations, the condemnation of centrism or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is to move on to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every application for a "no confidence" and every change in the rules of choice, the party's worldview is narrowed down.
In the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I lay low and ignore certain issues. Then everything would be “okay”.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the disintegration of my school class, I try to ensure a better quality of public service for those in need – both as a local councillor and a minister.
I've never covered my convictions, including in the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East District knew my position and knew the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Leader in the face of the approaching Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to its constituents (both Labour Party members and others): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threats of withdrawal of appointments or ad hoc political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr again up
Two late touchdowns may have somehow warped the final score. However, there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win in this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga match.
The team placed first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was a distinctive defense and a better take advantage of the opportunities that led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie may have been pleased with his subjects.
"So far, games have been a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I am satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose's team stated: "Ayr players must be respected. They took advantage of the opportunities that we had."
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after the touchdown of Grant Anderson and the rise of Frazier Clim. However, a yellow card for the Rory Hughes Scot, who came to the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking out of the penalty kick just before finishing the first half. He first scored the touchdown and later took the chance to raise, scoring a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose well started the second half. The touchdown of Patrick Anderson raised by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
There was then a longer halt due to Ruaridha Knott's serious injury. The player was lifted from the field on the stretcher. After the resuming, Ayr increased the lead after the touchdown of Stafford McDowall and the increase of Clim.
After that, Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose reused its numbers: a touchdown with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clim without a ball. MacPherson scored a touchdown on the back of the upcoming defense.
Climo took the chance to raise the score again, then managed to raise the score just after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty shot and enabled wingman Gregor Henry to score a fifth touchdown for the hosts.
The star of the series Still Game begins his career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the series Still Game, seems to be starting up in the catering industry. Recently, it has been discovered that he has become the director of the restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC station sitcom. He performs and co-creates the series together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the history of the show. All indications are that Ford Kiernan is already planning a future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the subject, although the informant Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in a "developing catering industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the area of the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags fly from public buildings.
In the naval ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the following motto is: “The sea is ours by law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the unaccessible sea of Bolivia, the memory of a shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources from the 19th century is still alive.
This hope is perhaps the greatest in several decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's actions are gaining momentum. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and counting on a favorable verdict," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be jointly watching the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the Hague-based organisation will recognise Bolivia’s claim and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to enter into negotiations to grant the state independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who next year will face a controversial fight for re-election, also puts hope in a Monday ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore in late August.
Some analysts, however, claim that the chances of a favorable ruling for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the power to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also stated that it would not affect the findings of possible talks.
As said by Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments have been put forward.
Unfortunately, Bolivia's last four years may have distanced the country from its destination.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
Morales' relentless rhetoric stripped the Chileans of any remnants of good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors in both countries since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision-making process was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year period of dispute with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — had used the topic of access to the sea as an element of political gameplay.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an excellent opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past".
North Korean authorities say that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho states that his nation will never dispose of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at a time when US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after meeting North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unem in Singapore.
Ri claims that the “freak” is that the lack of abolition of sanctions and US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War has ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington refuses to agree to sign the declaration without Pjongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the decommissioning of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means to guarantee safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows announce the appearance of the latest line of great headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, oversized headgears in their 2019 summer collection, which dazzled with style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
The extremely impractical hats prevailed on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
Valentino's distinctive work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered roundabout flooding the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to warm their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of peculiar masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had their mouth sewn up and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and another looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with big fashion, you're lucky.
Style Watchers predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
Undersized hats follow the "La Bomba", a straw hat with a 61 cm wide roundabout that everyone had already worn — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which passed through social media, presented another great creation on the runway — a straw beach bag almost as big as a model wearing a bathing suit.
The tanned orange reef bag, finished with raffi tassels and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, said FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores the next summer — because the designer managed to exert such a great influence, it would be difficult not to use demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills necessary for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could boast further excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other social activities.
The schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) attended by more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland seek to provide the best level of service provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their career path and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a school-specific curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the final exam this year show that languages are ranked first in league rankings, with the highest rates of reporting occurring in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A rating.
Data from 74 SCIs member schools showed that 72 percent of students obtained a higher A rating in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also obtained an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as subjects of choice, is carried out in the same field as STEM learning (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that the reason for the difficulties in hiring employers in 17 percent accounted for the lack of language skills of candidates.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring knowledge of languages,
Life - long skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a great advantage in the future, regardless of the path of professional development.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to the 2013 YouGov poll, which involved over 4000 adults of the British, 75% of them were unable to speak in a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and the French language was the only language whose percentage of people spoke was double-digit, i.e. 15%.
That is why investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of its languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interest, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from that will be taught by teaching staff specialised in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a teaching environment that prepares their children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed — no matter what their future is.
At present, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a large choice, variety and level.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut on the Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut in the Los Angeles Lakers eventually came to an end.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James would play in a Sunday preseason match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one but less than 48", stated Walton on the Lakers team's official website.
Team reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would most likely play an incomplete number of minutes.
After training held early this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers preseason games.
"At this stage of my career I do not need to participate in pre-season games to get ready," he said.
Trump election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of the five Trump-planned election rallies to take place next week, along with stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his suspension of his election to hold a vacant post in the Trump Supreme Court, he seeks to build support in the upcoming elections at the halfway point of government, as Republicans may be threatened with losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump's election rally be held tonight in West Virginia, and where will it be seen on the Internet?
Trump's election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held today at 7:00 p.m., Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia will be possible to follow live via the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the envisaged vote in the Senate to suspend the election for a maximum of one week, pending an investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral rallies is to support Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus President Trump's campaign with five rallies next week aims to "mobilise volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's campaign spokesman, who refused to give his name to the Reuters.
Today's election rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia candidate to the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the fight, keeping hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could have been what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely imaginary sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, and most of all in competitions like these.
So what's their momentum at this point?
"They were leading by six points, and now they are leading by only four, so I think we have a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are twelve more to be scored.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy designs to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could boast of scoring three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
Screaming at the whole throat as a sign of excitement became louder during its round, sinking the key putt and winning the match as he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
"Just focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming pair of the European team won four out of four and was not wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who missed Bogey on Saturday afternoon but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine on Friday morning.
The way in which they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from a noisy crowd proves that they should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, a morning fourball hero when paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double double double on the front of the Nine dug a Spaniard and a Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a change of strategy can happen at one moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has a hard time fighting in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead on the final Ryder Cup day.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with a score of 10–6 Saturday fourball and foursome matches against the United States.
Inspired by the duo — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — he assumed a charge, bringing two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing his previous score on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US non-customs team in the morning's fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make up for losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points out of the 12 singles to be held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while with Molinari (this team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a great-style fourball format, they defeated the pumped-out Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau, scoring an even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, who overwrought himself by two Saturday games, occasionally showed flashes of genius, but had so far lost 19 out of 29 matches in the fourball and foursome formats, and it was seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with world ranking positions 1 and 3 respectively.
However, the European team did not go all the way on this pleasant, cool day in a field southwest of Paris.
The three-time lead winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with a score of 2&1 over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team make a four-point loss by starting singles, although the Furic team would only need a tie to keep the trophy.
However, two days before the second place, Sunday counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says "strongly no" to unilateral disarmament without trust.
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday during a speech at the United Nations that the lack of abolition of sanctions only exacerbates North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way that the country unilaterally resigns from nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and a commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any specific response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea".
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's reluctance to a "staged" approach to denucleation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradually taking action, his statement seemed significant as it did not reject unilateral denucleation as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, held on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the "denuculating of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean War (1950–1953), but the United States delegation announced that Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted calls to mitigate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearisation in the first place" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, even opposing the signing of the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is a dream of people who behave in an ignorant way toward us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of abolition of sanctions exacerbates our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed by the United States leader at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, after which he added: "If the party to the denucleation issue were South Korea and not the United States, then there was no impasse in the denucleation of the Korean Peninsula".
Mim this, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to the previous year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles in the United States was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump (Mr. Evil President Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (a man rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said that much work was still needed, and also stated that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue and be continuous until we find full, final and verified denuclearisation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, attempting to choke funding for Pjongjangu's nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which in a few hours North Korea condemned him for "making gangster demands".
North Korea undertook this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile testing site and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He stated that Kim Jong Un had told him that the "adequate measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed himself to in Singapore, and that he had taken steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course for a proper rest period
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all students with more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of learning by "all-night caffeine-driven students".
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basis for taking care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a course by giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
"When the speech was finished, one girl came to me and said, "why is it only now that I'm in my senior year?"
She stated that no one had ever told her the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleeping habits help to achieve good results in science and sport, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health service, said that the course was decided to introduce after it was stated that students had suffered severe sleep deprivation within a week.
An hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of the dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects sports results, as well as how important it is to preserve the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not cause an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as they all have the right to know what health effects smoking carries”, added Professor Cheisler
The culture of pride from “all-night learning” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Providing enough sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" of students combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, or even avoiding gaining weight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger mode, making the student constantly hungry," he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step according to him is to ask all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar program of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set an alarm reminding when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, which can upset the daily rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes out Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during the away fight in Livingston, when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, scoring a score of 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first win from the 4-1 triumph recorded in February over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing for his team a difference of eight points compared to Ladbrokes Premiership leader — Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Ranger squad showing lack of commitment did not look to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a drop in sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third — just behind the Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers' team may have further problems with the need to treat the head wound to the linear referee Calum Spence after he has been hit by an object thrown from the grandstands for guests.
Gerrard introduced eight changes to the team, allowing him to overtake Ayr and advance to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, in turn, went with the same 11 Livingston, who took a point from the Hearts team last week, being delighted by the way his well-trained team tormented his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored the goal in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitching of the ball allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the helper did not take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his friend Alan Lithgow playing as a defender could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter of an hour, but it looked like they had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he deserved a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson disbanded the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed to give only two good shots in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely concerned about the head of the Lassana Coulibala and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While a goal scored by Livingston in 34 minutes opening the match may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into getting it.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep fixed piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who remained calm, passing to Menga to simply finish the action.
Gerrard was busy on his break and traded Coulibally on Ryan Kent — the switch almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it by coming from his position.
The Livingston team continued to drag guests into the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long passes one after another.
Holt's team may have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor made a good bet in front of Jacobs, after which Lithgow dismissed the game from the corner.
The Ranger Reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a penalty kick when he became entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his gaze again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our release "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882 — 136 years ago... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now you can hear something!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method involves separating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein common to many cancers. Then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine teaching the immune system, the loss of ovarian cancer was observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results indicate that the vaccine is very promising".
HER2 "powers the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" their location of cancer cells worked to treat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-trump diatria on Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA cap on her head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was "exploded" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised United States President Donald Trump and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing his third piece titled Ghost Town that night, during which he had his cap on with the inscription "Make America Great", he conducted a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America by now," he said.
SNL's program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony made before the Senate Judicial Commission regarding allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's speech video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
"They're after me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're after me!
And then they say I have no choice," he said — Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You say I have no choice,” adding, “I will put on a supermen’s cape, so that you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Let's accept."
His words caused the audience to "wake" twice, and SNL crew members looked embarrassed, reports Variety. A person in the studio during these events: "There was a grave silence in the studio".
West was invited to the show in the replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of the song I Love it in disguise of a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted the following: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR THE MAFIA'S STATEMENT".
Karen Hunter's talk show on her Twitter said West was just "he was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I will NOT reward people (by buying her music or clothes or supporting her "art"), which I believe accepts and spreads an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we free," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, followed by an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder of stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear in Belfast on Monday in court.
The charges will be investigated by the D.A.'s office.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington addresses the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO television series "Game of Thrones".
A 31-year-old actor hit the macho hero's stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
While interviewing the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the Game of Thrones plan, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt “enough confident enough”, addressing the issue.
"I personally feel quite confident at this point — where have we made a mistake in the subject of manhood?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for television due to the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are natural and learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to stand on a particular side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can we do to change that?
Clearly, not everything is right with young men."
In an interview, he also confessed that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the end of the series the following year, saying that he had finished with battlefields and horses.
As of November, Kit will be playing the play "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is a story about the film producer and his brother — the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his wife Rose as the best thing that happened to him at the Game of Thrones.
"On the set I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emmy of the fantasy series Rose played Ygritte, an object of love interest to the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people affected by this problem are reported by healthcare professionals in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to one year.
The transmission of HIV by the sexes is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the country's conservative values, research estimates that 70–90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members has revealed the data of Republican Party Senators — these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory".
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's websites of the aforementioned legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party assured that these accusations were brought forward by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wings".
"Lies, lies, and even more vile lies," reported Waters in a statement on Twitter..
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
It was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on sexual misconduct charges against the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and published information regarding a member of the Waters team, as Hill says.
"This unsubstantiated charge is totally false and it is a hundred percent lie," continued Waters.
"A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated charge is totally false and it is a hundred percent lie."
The Waters statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
"This kind of denial is wrong," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He can't question the motives of the accuser.
For that, he must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exhibiting excessive anger during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a big deal if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her cabinet had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent accusations".
"The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to legal responsibility for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Review of the film Johnny English: Knockout — spy parody with weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British theme has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of action and comedy films "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will self-loathing satire about how hopeless we are become a new export product of the country?
In any case, always surprised, characterized by a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English again received a license to screw up — his name more than anything else signals that he is an elaborate, comical product designed for non-English-speaking viewers.
He is of course a silly secret agent who despite his bizarre tastes for smoothie glamour has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasio Bean and a hint of this guy adding one note to the theme tune of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world mystery man — Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's forgotten television commercials, in which he left behind chaos.
In the latest Johnny English series, there is one or two notable moments.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, while wearing medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by rotor blades.
On the screen you can clearly see Atkinson's gift to physically play comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially since currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be directed at children rather than adults — in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as creative and coherent as the gags in Atkinson's silent films about Jack Bean.
The ever-present assumption is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker penetrates the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents active in the field — to the terror of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's bitterness spell, which is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power by impersonating Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to expand her wings.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that due to the disclosure of the identities of all active spies she will have to reinstate one of the retired agents.
And that means the inept Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few good gags while giving English spying lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for a briefing, reuniting with his former Bough assistant, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the submarine commander — a cheerful but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of the party in Her Majesty's secret service return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously overwhelmed by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve UK computer problems — he is the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters, they set the French restaurant on fire; they bring chaos, sneaking aboard the luxury yacht Volta; and English wreak havoc when using a virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
In this final sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite a nice and loud performance, the whole film is very much like children's television.
Typical middleman.
As with other Johnny English films, I could not resist thinking: can the British film industry not give Rowaniv Atkinson a role that would really suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that provides for a four-day working week for the British, for which they will receive a salary for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party will consider introducing a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary for five days.
The party is reported to want the heads of companies to hand over the savings gained by the revolution associated with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an extra day off.
This would enable employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, gaining the same amount of pay.
Sources say that this idea "will enter" into the party's economic programme and plans to go out in front of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from a change of economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party in an interview with The Sunday Times said, "He expects a change of policy to be announced before the end of this year."
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is something that fits into the party's approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party undertook to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesperson said, "Four-day work week is not party policy and its introduction is not considered by it".
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from faceless "directors" and "speculators" in utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party government could make "offsettings" based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds in order to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond on the "60 Minutes" program to the question whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their attitude
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and caused the question whether the findings of the investigation office could have prompted Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview leading the 60 Minutes program, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that might lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina friend.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
I called him after the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, decisive and unambiguous."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change her, a strong charge is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the people he says could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival event and has it done to any extent to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held next Saturday in New York City, an annual musical event that can boast an impressive composition of stars and an equally impressive mission — to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of celebrities such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the most important goal of this event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, making a phone call or other significant activities to help raise awareness about the goal of eliminating poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast over the 12 years remaining to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting an entry on a tweeter?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different objectives.
He also argues that these actions helped to stimulate global leaders to declare commitments and regulations worth over $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British investor partnership and realtors involved in "helping children to reach their full potential", which promised to hand Rwanda $35 million to help with the elimination of malnutrition in the country, after members of Global Citizen sent over 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustice, such as malnutrition, into history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after implementing more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which read, "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?",
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the once great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing during this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to "block" Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy into the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government — was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is to want to mediate the energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, thanks to its Navy, has the opportunity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, comparing Russia to "a pony who knows one trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration continues its mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — which is much cheaper for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump's officials, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the implementation of this project is purely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with United States Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position sparked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the midterm elections she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix a corrupt government. This also applies to women who hold the highest position," she said, The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy for President".
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying she was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren expressed his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option "probably" said that the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other known names from the Democratic camp taken into consideration for potential candidacy in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said she would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) by Track Palin at Donald Trump's electoral rally
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September for the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he has to go through when he returns, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at Donald Trump's election rally in Tulsa City, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "a taboo theme", after which she said about her son and other war veterans: "they return a little changed, return toughened, return wondering if respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other military members have given their country."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, urging him to give false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an intoxicated state, as Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, stated.
18 States and District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for a new United States policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and district filed an amicus curiæ letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberty Union organization filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent sons from the gang" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances, and such prohibition violates this principle," as stated in the amicus curiæ letter.
Prosecutors further argued in their letter that a policy refusing immigrants entry harms the United States economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and “be the necessary labour force”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country of origin due to racial, religious, national or ethnic persecution or fear or because they belong to a particular social group or have such and not other political beliefs," said Sessions in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
The asylum was never intended to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts at Pal in a situation where the number of fatalities doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
‘Embulans bring bodies every minute.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching through things soaked in water and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, quickly overflowed.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and arm, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I've been squeezed into the ruins of the wall," Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family came to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and her voice went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Ambassador accuses China of "harassing" propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page commercial in an American journal commending the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the United States Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowance in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States Congress elections that will take place on 6 November — China denies this allegation.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the United States elections confirmed what American officials said to the Reuters agency that this is a new stage in Washington's escalation of the campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal that foreign governments place commercials promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington currently lead to an escalation of the trade war, which led to an increase in tariffs for reciprocal imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa State Governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has done harm to American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China "now with doubled force begins harassment, placing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"With its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the respected American tradition of free speech and free press, placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
But there will be no votes of opposition in the Beijing street kiosk and no real reflection of divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic direction, given that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate themselves before mid-term elections women with voting rights through the Kavanaugh scandal, warn analysts
While many leading Republicans support and defend the nominee for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court in the face of several sexual assault charges, an analyst warns that you members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions behind this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already want to vote officially.
"This cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon)'s efforts to conduct a last-minute investigation by the FBI were enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday — they won't forget it tomorrow and they won't forget it by November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "Nov is coming," demonstrating in the Senate lobby due to the Republicans' decision to remain in control of the Judicial Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic stated.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale," said one of Stu Rothenberg's news sites, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and it is true.
But it may be taller, especially among the indecisive women from the suburbs and younger voters aged between 18 and 29, who, though they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault directed at a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if Republicans had decided to approve the candidacy, this might have been a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with a lot of mess," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also the way the Republicans handled this situation and how they treated Ford," stated on one of Guy Cecil's news channels, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a slightly greater support being given to the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent stated that they definitely or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents stated that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during the deposition, while only 30% stated the same about Ford.
After Flake exerted pressure, the FBI launched an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during his admission at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web network plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the creation of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"An historic moment has come".
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own "webshop with personal data" or otherwise POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal power of attorney through data".
According to the company's president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project and a volunteer programmers community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
"I don't ask them for permission."
In a medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed a lot to the debate on net neutrality.
Calling to life the Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think of the next era in network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The distinction of the clergyman with the Victoria Cross during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman Church of England, who during World War I was awarded the Victoria Cross, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Reverend Bishop Bernard Vann was decorated on 29 September 1918 for attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly on the centenary of his grandfather's recognition was "a uniquely symbolic character."
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He then rushed into the line of fire and led it forward with “the greatest courage” and then single-handedly launched an attack on the field division, disposing of three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never face, but at the same time something humble."
Along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the end of the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to attend the parade" and added that "the courage of the true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans won't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, packed with emotions, and eventually not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change of program to Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they did not sleep until the early hours of the morning specifically to see this fight.
One Twitter fan described the switch to children's cartoon as a "some sick joke".
"Under the government regulation, the content of this type of content is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Bellator when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp's pig, yes".
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work out a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think of a rerun of the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
“But it is Sunday six o’clock in the morning, so that we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change of program there, we were covered with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to a standard quantity. We wanted to satisfy the fans too much and unfortunately we overreached.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
On the program Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this years-old program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on the show for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, "To this day, this sense of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something worth" so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT community activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he wanted to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give "hope" to others in this way.
Three times the world's champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — had "surprised him".
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, pointing out that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father's death due to cancer three years later," he said, "he found it difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple remained parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"Last year it was most important for me to win a gold medal," he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to have a front row seat.
“I couldn’t tell him, “you won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad”, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud performed by Heather Small — which accompanied him in preparation for the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing lack of Mickelson form on the bench during the Saturday Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form to keep his mark off.
Mickelson, playing for the twelfth time in the event held every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as often happened in his case on the United States team, a five-time major winner had to spend the day cheering the team and working on improving his game in the hope of fixing the reason for his bench referral.
A 48-year-old who has never given the simplest punches, even at the peak of his career, does not work well in the tightest field of Le Golf National, where the wrong strokes are ruthlessly punished by long cords.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday he must face the precision of the winner of the British Open — Francesca Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the start of 12 singles) start playing with a verve, Mickelson's match may prove extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — he could not have done anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, held me with his hand, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the fame gallery and has contributed a lot to the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it went down, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everybody else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws in his account, and Furyk said his presence brought a lot to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, mockery, and it's good to have him in the band's room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
His person brings much more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large scoring advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant scoring advantage before starting singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult gameplay.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in a match in the Valderrama field, where, along with the accompanying Vice Captain Sev Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest of possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget that we had a big advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the Valderrama field we won only by a hair," said Bjorn, in the picture, after winning 5–3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave the lead 10–6 on the Le Golf National field.
Time will tell me and all the team members that this is not over.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It won't be over until points appear on the board.
We have a purpose, which is to get the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
From the beginning I said I was focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the opposite side are – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: “I would not have done better.
But tomorrow is different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's another issue.
It's good to play with your partner when things go smoothly, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
This message that has to be conveyed to the players is to give it everything tomorrow.
The partner also has to do his best."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results on their own than when playing with their partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced large returns of the last day's action, being a member of the winning team in the Brookline field, after which he suffered a defeat after the European team had performed a “miraculous thing in the Medinah field”.
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we play 12 important games — you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this rush goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our lineup and set up the boys in a way that would enable us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the lead half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he can handle the whole game," Bjorn told Bjorn about his singles election.
New German warship again delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen at least next year due to defective systems and rising costs at an alarming rate, as reported by the local media.
The release of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, citing the words of a military spokesperson.
The ship should be included in the Navy in 2014, but as a result of the problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the 2007 Navy will replace the aging Bremen class fregates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions preventing detection, ensuring, among others, reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to exploit new frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported on a number of key "software and hardware faults" that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the size of the Bremen class's older frigate.
It also turned out that the ship was far too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility for the Navy to carry out future modernizations.
It is believed that the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7,000 tonnes is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering level of EUR 3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with putting new frigates into service are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings regarding the shrinking power of the German maritime fleet.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the navy "ends ships capable of using".
He also said that this problem had increased over time due to the decommissioning of old units without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the navy.
National Trust eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the estate in the Scottish Highlands area aims to show how bats use the landscape when gaining food.
Research results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to focus future efforts to protect them.
Research conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will concern common dwarfs and minor ones, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats in the family of redheaded nocturnes at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed in key locations around the estate for the full-season tracking of bat activity.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field studies using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how individual species behave.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape-scale behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the girdles and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly traps and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex technique of echolocation to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct tests, inspections of the grows, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland at the Three Estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says it is ideal for bats territory.
"Three has a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us to better understand what they need to develop."
It highlights the importance of bat control before proceeding with maintenance work in the estates, as the unintentional destruction of one gherkins can kill up to 400 females and young, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing, harassing, or disturbing them, and destroying their girdles is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in the case of many species we don't even know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges, while his lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves", using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday reports, Der Spiegel, the footballer was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the charges were announced, in an instagram live broadcast addressed to his 142 million followers described these reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said a five-time gold ball winner.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I am happy and everything is fine," added the footballer with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine in connection with allegations that they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would claim compensation for "moral harm in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident was scheduled to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
Following a meeting at Ronaldo and Mayorga's nightclub, they reportedly went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped a woman anally, as evidenced by documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that “99 percent is a good guy” who was deceived by this “one percent”.
According to Ronaldo's records, he confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she still can't forget the alleged incident.
During the alleged assault, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying a sum of EUR 100 million for him.
Brexit: Britain would "for all time regret" the departure of car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if, after leaving the European Union, it lost its status as a world leader in car production, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "disconcerned" when a representative of Toyota UK said in an interview with the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then production will be stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers say, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of UK leaving the European Union without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to its factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresy May plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border control".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will enable us not only to enjoy the current success but also allow us to make the most of the situation," said BBC Radio 4 today.
"The statements not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, show that we must be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient set of supply chains."
Toyota's representation was unable to determine how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the Unite Association's board of directors, said that the union members are becoming more and more concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are liquidated, they will never be reinstated again.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" due to an ongoing struggle for a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as stated on Sunday by the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who explores the possibility of Russian interference in elections, links between close collaborators Trump and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times newspaper reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wiretap to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from his post on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was going to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There was a postponement of the meeting to avoid interfering with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission during which the testimony was given by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News Station.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll let the press know."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders had not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The show's lead, Chris Wallace, asked about the cause of this.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by reluctance to "ostentatious" television journalists, and then added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentatious".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President conducts more "questions and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without providing evidence: "We've met with numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, said Sanders, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will yield places for such sessions, during which we will be able to talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or attend open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, acting too freely and sometimes bizarrely in front of the journalists gathered.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to express their thanks from the country and ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of processing applications for "sttled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations for Britain’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer, and the relevant decisions will be taken in the autumn of that year.
The British Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his nationality.
Friends from across the EU and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head injury
The charging Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match against Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a defeat of the Tennessee team with a score of 31-27, reported Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came up to the sideline, then slid to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then put him on a stretcher and carried him out for further research.
Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a sophomore student released from representing the college for a year to improve his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team following a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ended, he had five charge, which gives him 18 charge throughout the season.
Foreign purchasers will be charged a higher tax fee when purchasing real estate in the UK
According to the new tories plans, buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to offset Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting a young electorate.
The increase in tax fees will include those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury predicts that this will bring as much as £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax fee, and the additional funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to bridge Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden of more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and non-tax-absorbent companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
In addition to the current tax charge, including the higher second - house and rental rates introduced two years ago, the additional charge may be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to yield up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to an increase in prices and hindering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time outside the country, many prosperous regions — especially the capital — have evolved into “the city of spirits. ”
The new rules enter only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a tax reduction to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the site, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of low-cost housing in order to eliminate the "residential scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of eviction "for no reason".
It also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I would engage in rebuilding the British dream of making every next generation's life better than the previous generation.
This also means repairing our unstable housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work here and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here with equal ease as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very remote, but the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Selector of Scotland"
Sunderland team coach Jack Ross says that his "greatest ambition" is to become a Scotland selector at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scotsman is committed to working on the recovery of the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
It moved to Stadium of Light that summer after bringing St Mirren's club back to Scottish Premiership in the final season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a contender,
but I only managed to get to B-staff," said Ross in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched Scotland matches in Hampden with my father, and it always attracted me.
However, this possibility will come only if I succeed as club coach".
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's coaching position included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach claims he does not feel intimidated, taking on the role of such prominent figures in such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Currently, success will be measured for me by whether I will be able to bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and its facilities, it certainly belongs there," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have been successful here, only if I succeed."
Ross' coaching career has only lasted for three years. Before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts team coaching team.
He then helped Alloa get promoted again after being demoted to the third league, and in the following season he led the St Mirren team from the brink of decline to the championship title.
Jack Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point," he recalls when he took on the position of Coach Alloa.
“I really believed that running a team was much better for me than just playing.
It's gonna sound weird because as a player, I've done well, I've made good money, and I've achieved some quantifiable successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure of coaching, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others and now I'm doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life."

Research shows that the best time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave caused a sudden influx of customers to British pubs, but it bounced hiccups in restaurant chains.
Studies showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting company that compiled the data says: “The constant heat and longer than expected England's participation in the World Championships caused the July results to develop similar to June, when the pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant's earnings fell even more.
The 1.8% decrease in sales in restaurants recorded in June increased even more in July.
The pubs and bars offering drinks did their best — their sales growth surpassed the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food — dropped by three percent".
Paul Newman of RSM’s entertainment and tourism analysis firm says: “These results have been in line with the trend we have been following since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the volume of consumption 'outside home' remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments is not surprising, although the decline in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences, given the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and hot summer came at the least favorable moment for owners of food-service premises and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such a necessary respite."
The combined increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand development.

One in five kids has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents.
Studies have shown that one in five children — some aged only 11 — have secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents and teachers
A survey conducted among 20,000 students of secondary schools showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
These news heightened concerns that sexual content was published on them
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "main" account that they show their parents
One in five children — some only 11 years of age — set up social networking accounts that they do not reveal to adults.
A survey conducted among 20,000 students of secondary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to the Instagram site where you can share photos.
These news heightened concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted to running a concluded "main" account that shows their parents, and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who encouraged others to "rape her."
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to holding private accounts.
HMC's president, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
During the Scottish Athletics Executive General Meeting, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for people who manage the sport to benefit from her rich international experience she gained in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics communities, and we are confident that introducing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm very happy to be able to give the board the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really help with sports management in Scotland."
An American who, among his four Olympic gold medals, has victories in runs at 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now regularly performs in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell me if I was going to regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was a gruesome job, but I fully recovered, learned how to walk again and went back to training!
Thank you for all your support!"
Lactator advertising, which compares mothers to cows, creates extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactose company caused a storm on the Internet, publishing a commercial that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
In order to announce the launch of the world's first "silent lactator for wearing under clothing", its producer, Elvie, published a mocking commercial in the form of a music video that highlights the freedom it gives mothers.
It depicts four true mothers dancing in a hay-filled cowshed to a song where they hear the words, "Yes, I milk, but I can't see the tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it doesn't just change my tits."
Refren goes like this: "Pump them, pump them, feed them to the children, pump them, pump them, milk their ladies."
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, sparked major controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many say it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they must get pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their children are taken from them after a few days of birth," wrote one user.
Elvie Lactator can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is, of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactating for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely detached from reality.”
Others defend the clip — one of the women said that she thought the song was “funny”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was taking food away.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for the bottom line.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a funny commercial for mothers who pull out food (often at work or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactating women attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many nursing women feel like cows.
The Lactator Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be worn unnoticed under the bra for feeding, which gives women freedom to move, to hold children on their hands, or even to leave the house while pulling out the food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Lacator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a brave and provocative premiere.
When we put together feeding women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with food withdrawal, while also presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children with this product attached appeared on the runway during the Marty Jakubowski show.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detainees of immigrants is increasing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border every month does not exactly change. This is partly due to the fact that the strict rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration made it difficult for children to be placed in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually also undocumented immigrants who fear to be exposed to deportation if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the common farm would collect fingerprints, which would then be passed on to immigration offices.
Last week a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had volunteered as sponsors for children left unattended.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had not previously been listed.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally residing in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we are constantly pursuing them," Albence said.
The shelter workers say that, as part of their efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as has been the case according to previous standards.
Much will be posed through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legitimize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders found that these problems were even more serious for larger centres, such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to miss signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them the right time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in this country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces reside on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem claims that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to "conduct its holy battle until the territory of Syria is cleared" from both terrorist groups and from "any foreigner who is illegally present."
There are currently approximately 2,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in Syria, who are mainly involved in training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrians against President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in a war - destroyed country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused "some western countries" of "raising irrational fear" that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns," he said.
"They politicize matters that should have a purely human dimension".
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad enters into a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will receive no help to rebuild.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeframe", and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including militants from the Al-Qaeda-related Front of Defence of the Levant Peoples' Front, who would be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and opposition to draw up a draft of the postwar constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "verifying the current constitution's provisions" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected to a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency would have ended earlier in his removal from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far".
So far, there's no sign of spectator fatigue.
As of 2014, CNN's ratings in the prime time have doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's channels have nearly tripled, up to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average 2.4 million viewers are attracted at peak ratings, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast on MSNBC has achieved the highest performance among cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers of evening news shows.
"People fly like moths to fire — that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC's TV series "Designated Survivor" about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She recalls how she was taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has entertainment value".
Of course, reports from Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of joining immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Disengagement is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch the sixth hour panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of the secret informants while writing the book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket ("pretty charged clothing", as The Washington Post said) or about the implications of shocking descriptions of the details of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the way I used to.
"What he does, in part, resembles the reality show in that it delivers new content every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and daily twists of Trump's action (like an attack on NFL league players or the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're gonna be late.
When I met Mike Fleisch this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where it has its home, was beautiful, but he sat inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He could not get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was weighed down.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people were saying 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleisch told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

An inflow of money from outside to an election campaign for Congress
It is no wonder that after the reorganization of the constituencies, resulting in two current congressmen in the race, a river of cash flows into the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by the Democratic representative, Conor Lamb, who obtained his seat in another district during the special election of last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former district of the 12th in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new district of 17.
The district maps were corrected after the January ruling of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were designated unfairly, which gave the Republicans the advantage and was unconstitutional.
The race in the new district of the 17th began with the campaign struggle between the party's main funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee committees (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair in a widely commented election to the 18th constituency held in March.
This position has been a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump has won in this district by 20 points.
Policy experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from this idea
Diplomats have noted that Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and until his partners expelled Trump Organization's management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
Officials of the State Department decided to cancel the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to " recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan," as said in her statement of this month's department spokesman, Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions considered were only to be imposed on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million from the United States for, among other things, the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to cover the restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very severe for this Central American country, which faces high unemployment and high murder rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the conclusions of a similar assembly last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top-level officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now, at a conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to perform as a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the assembly.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
John Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who, subject to their anonymity, agreed to discuss internal talks.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be a report by a special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, the investigation by Robert Mueller also investigates whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him while preparing for a re-approach before the voters, and may even be tried in front of the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall — or those in equivalent positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how long this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The railways of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing the inevitable course of democracy.
There are several such turning points in front of the Americans now.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our newspaper that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly commissioned FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh proves incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed judge of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
Above all, will we elect to Congress in the middle of the presidential term those who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials, difficult times will come for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jewish, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light sabbas candles on that table marked with swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how could I not look to the future optimistically?"

Rangers club player, Graham Dorrans, is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna team match
The Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the awareness that the victory against the Austrians, obtained after the impressive draw with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until tied 2:2 with Villareal the knee injury prevented Assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that the result will work on the Rangers like a trampoline for greater success.
"We did well because Villarreal is in good shape," said a 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something — and we scored a point.
We may have been able to squeeze them at the end, but in general, a tie is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important night for Europe.
We hope that we can score three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent got a good score in his last match. However, I am sure that with the support of the fans we will pass this and we will win a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of retirement savings spends women's sleep in the eye
Although those who took part in the survey knew exactly how they wanted them to be taken care of, few talked to their family about it.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants stated that she had spoken to her spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's Life Insurance Company.
Where do I start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you express your will.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how you want to be looked after, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will be prevented by this court battle.
Appoint a trusted health care agent who will supervise it and ensure that the appropriate persons act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also hiring a proxy to handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all the information you need to get it ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who doctors are," asks Martin.
‘What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan at hand".
Man shot multiple times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a gun gun on his way home from an evening party.
Forty-kilkuletek was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police determined the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as "a random action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries we sustained do not endanger the life of a man, and the police are asking for witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the broken communication, rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupatene, which is located north of Palu, closer to the 7.5 degree earthquake epicentre.
After the Palu disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important information about the town of Palu and the kabupatena of Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island. As estimated in 2017, it was inhabited by 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupatene (administrative unit with a level below the province) extending along the northwest coast of the island over 300 km long.
It is estimated that there were 2,99,200 people residing in 2017.
The main sectors of the Middle Celebesi economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal cabupate of Donggala.
Another source of income for the province are the nickel mines, but they are mainly found in Morali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disaster Elimination Agency, the earthquakes and tsunamis have invaded Palu and Donggala several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in Western Donggala.
Indonesia is located on a seismicly active Pacific ring of fire, causing earthquakes to occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The major earthquake, which struck the western coast of Aceh Province in the north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: Towards the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off Sumatra coast.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, an earthquake of 6.8 degrees occurred, triggering a tsunami that entered the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jay's kabupaten in the Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction that brought the disastrous 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami wave, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and caused temporary problems for thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers originating in Wasilla, Alaska, a 29-year-old boy was arrested with domestic violence charges, obstruction of filing a report and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
KTUU station reports Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her information, last Saturday, he was brought to trial, where he stated in his defense speech that he was “certainly innocent.”
On Palina, there are three Class A misdemeanors, which means that he can receive even a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He was also accused of class B misconduct, for which he threatens to punish a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veteran Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of filing and possession of weapons intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked the aggressive behavior of her son to the PTSD he acquired during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people were killed by tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed as a result of the Friday earthquake that invaded the Indonesian island of Celebes.
An earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
An earthquake occurred near the central part of Celebes Island, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City.
Federal prosecutors from New York City are demanding the death penalty for Sayful Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City resulting in the deaths of eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for a federal offence since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a bike path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck that was run over by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification in the southern district of New York about the intention to demand the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment covering 22 positions, including eight counts of murder in illegal activity — which is usually followed by federal prosecutors in matters of organized crime — and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection". The way Saipov conducted it, they described it as "monster, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought harm, harm and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," states a notice of intent.
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina who stayed in New York City for tourism.
The last time a death penalty was filed in the southern district of New York City ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually in September 2009 he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they had been found guilty of conspiracy and espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which came from Uzbekistan, he showed no remorse within months of the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was comfortable with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
On the indictment of 22 counts, he answers that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov, said that they are "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after admitting guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought upon all the persons concerned," he said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory Parliamentary NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest, which took place during the Tories Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people."
Former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" beating from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage were Secretary of Brexit, "The United Kingdom would already be out of the Union".
However, the inclusion of tories opting to remain in the community for a separate protest against Brexit held in the city further highlighted the burden of reconciling its deeply divided ranks facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her compromise plan with the Chequers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite the opposition, she will pursue an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labourers to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to "pull the plan out of the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become a proxy, to whom responsibility for negotiations with Brussels should be transferred.
"If he was involved, we would be out of the Union now," he said.
Member of Wellingborough added, "I support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers plan."
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to create our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: "The thought that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay in the Union is completely untrue."
The demonstration also featured Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party, who told reporters: “I am just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who populate the streets and who chose us do not support it either.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a speech addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: "Premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage stated that politicians participating in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you do it'."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of betraying Brexit feel hot.
"We are mobilising an army of people of this country who gave us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
During this time, Brexit's opponents marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved "Torysi v Brexit" banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, ridiculed conservatives for security issues of party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can organize IT systems and all the technology to handle the Canada plus plan, the liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
‘It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will seriously consider running for president".
As reported by The Boston Globe, a Massachusetts Democrat representative spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is currently said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government — and she also means a woman on top.”
Arrest of the perpetrator of the fatal shooting in which the LSU team player, Wayde Sims, was killed
Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana reported on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in a Friday shooting in which a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims, was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson during a conference held at 11:00 East Time.
On Friday, a recording of the shooting was published asking for help in identifying the man seen on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed as a result of a gunshot wound near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with a firearm in his head and died as a result," said the media chief of police, Murphy J. Paul according to the service 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde.
After being detained, during which he did not resist, he was taken into custody at East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, with a total of 10 runs in the final season, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the dance floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's instructions enabled him to win with Sebastian Vetlel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would have a major impact on the race's outcome.
Bottas, who competed from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the service station first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the peleton's tail, which should decide the fate of the race.
Mercedes's racer drove into boxing in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after the wheel-in-the-wheel action, resulting in Ferrari's driver reluctantly leaving the inner section of the track, risking being pushed into the defensive after a double move of rival to defend his position in the third turn, Hamilton stepped out in the lead.
Max Verstappen competed at the end of the bet and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was ranked seventh.
He then led for a large part of the race because he did not change tires to perform a quick finish and take away Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he drove to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the remaining eight laps he failed to accelerate.
“It was a hard day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team gave their best to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
During the meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she had not revealed the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the nominee for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Christina Ford to the Justice Senate Committee. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the senate showed that people are “snatchery, malicious, and lying.”
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the senate that we have been witnessing for several days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, mean, malicious and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they say to us, 'Oh, I didn't do it'.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... have you revealed the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't," he added, mocking the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's innuendo, I didn't reveal her story," says Feinstein before the committee, as reported in The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to be discreet, and according to her request I did not reveal these contents."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I am telling you, it was a really bad speech of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of a candidate for Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use innuendos for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power by all means.
You can see the wickedness, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over and control," said the president according to Mediaite news.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match against Dundee club Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants team
The Dundee Stars club atone for his Friday loss in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants team, winning a rematch match at home 5:3 on Saturday.
The giants quickly scored a two-gate lead after shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie leveled the score, after which Dwyer re-learned the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard again leveled the score, scoring a goal for Dundee's team, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's wards, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won against Dundee's team in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met this season for the fourth time — the first three games won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaulla's ace. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's ace.
After an intense opening in 13:10 minutes Sullivan introduced the host team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt leveled the score in 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants' advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period of the evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard again leveled the score with a goal scored during the game in the lead at 27:37 a minute.
At the end of the second period, Cowne and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen provide the Dundee team with the first lead in this match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last period by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost four games for their last five games will play next Friday at their home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller dies by helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia was hailed a hero after he died, helping a plane safely take off with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were declared missing after a major earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area, and many people have been trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the rocked air control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air airliner (flight 6321), which was just on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from Australia's ABC News station, Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This message has torn our hearts apart," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands. The national disaster eradication agency informs that the opportunity to travel to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Six metres of tsunami waves destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said Sky News: “The ambulances keep bringing bodies.
It's starting to run out of drinking water.
Small shops are looted".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN reports.
This year Indonesia has already hit an earthquake that killed over 550 people on Lombok Island.
The plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines report that one person is missing after the plane crashes into the lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed on the lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, reports that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon they could not count one man who was traveling on a fernous plane.
They assured that they were trying to find him together with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport, local boats helped save the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the disaster, and the exact course of it is also unknown.
Air lines and the U.S. Navy claim that the aircraft landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
"This has helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said that he and other people managed to get through the striped water to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
According to him, cabin crew members panicked and shouted, and he himself sustained a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue was also helped by sailors who worked nearby to modernize the waterfront. They were able to transport people ashore with a blowboat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to data from Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in plane crashes registered in Papua New Guinea, but there are no Air Niugini among these lines.
Analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. ended presenting evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for many hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to the judges how using cell phone records he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had obtained location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis' ferocious evening was from Chambers. Thus he overturned his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that at a time when Quinton was scheduled to hang out with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was on Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that "he lied because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details, as well as text messages and calls from the phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The final speech of the defense is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed — What Is A Conscious Hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre by filling its music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed group of Bristol, today's hip-hop departed from the original political content and social issues.
Team members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal after a "racist" text.
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her from her racist work after receiving a mistakenly addressed text in which the child's mother complains that she is "another black person".
The couple denies being racists, comparing the lawsuit to "shangout".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly consternated when it turned out that the new sitter, Giselle Maurice, who was feuding on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
"NOEE, THE SAME NINE PERSON," she wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to reports from the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the blunder she had made, “feared” fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that a warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job badly and was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home to Uber.
She now demands from a couple compensation for a relief of $350 a day multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed with a residence, although she did not sign a contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do these things," said the Post newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified, because after they insulted her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
“Would you entrust your children to a person you have caused harm even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to "shant", Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blow something like this?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public quickly passed a few sentences on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that publishers of Paddington books feared that readers would not feel a connection with a talking bear
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It is hard to put herself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She claims that her father, who, before a little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year the 60th anniversary of the book's release seems "sweet-bitter".
About Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he did not boast," he adds.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you felt proud of him, although it was not your fault.
I think Paddington's success was more or less perceived in this way.
Although he invented it and created it, he always did the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“ Nad called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t make it, ” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly stopped working and were eliminated from her body.
She died a little earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit around and wait to know that it was all developing.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was with other people.
I had to really hang on."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the torment she had been through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
I felt like I needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards from women in mourning are meant to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to dissuade others from wanting to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on the Welsh bridge postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was depressed, and he took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he says.
The 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could brighten up any room with it."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really black place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people to talk to and talk to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't stay silent — talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, sad or anything," he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “This is tearing a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance because the FBI is launching an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — a limited time-limited and limited-scale investigation — perhaps we could achieve some unanimity," said Jeff Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "fall apart" into opposing camps, leading to a stalemate.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
All their aversion comes from the moment.
The elections to Congress are in a few weeks — November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly diminish.
George W. Bush had already picked up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of refugees from North Korea is decreasing.
According to South Korean legislature, since seven years ago Kim Jong Un took over, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South has fallen.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1127 escapes last year, and in 2011 — 2706.
According to him, more accurate border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human smugglers are key factors that have affected the situation.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are eventually proposed citizenship of South Korea.
According to the Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the border has illegally exceeded over 30,000 North Koreans.
Most escape through China, which have the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often force them back into the country.
The relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang, where they had talks about negotiations on denucleation that had previously become a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore. The result of this meeting is a general agreement to seek the purification of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not making progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech he gave to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and claims he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court
A minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "a hysteric" and said that he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think if a woman had acted like this, she would have been considered a 'hysteric'," Pelosi told Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh made to the Justice Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screamed and lost his speech as he discussed family issues and high school years.
He also explicitly chased Democrats from the committee, setting out the charges of "grotesque and coordinated assassination of reputation" organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because he exposed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by issuing these statements as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's dismissal from office if he had received the nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she fears possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh omitted questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person into court who expects us to say 'how wonderful it is'," Pelosi added.
And women must rule it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of raging rage, and she can't get it out of her mouth without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"That's pretty common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager at a company helped me enormously. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she made up a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she talks to 'You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an outlet of anger partly because they are in fact misunderstood.
One of my most prominent memories of one of the first jobs in an office dominated by men is how one day I started crying out of unspeakable rage. One elderly woman, a cool executive, whom I was always a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and led me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think they're sad, and they're glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, a then MP for Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a mistress on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the borders of Patricia realized that she might actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates for the election, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone described the situation as Snow White and seven dwarves."
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder was behind in raising funds and promised herself she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 had only 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discount?" she wondered.
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion — gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and rage at sexism — that her voice was tied in her throat.

What the benefits of the economic war between the United States and China can bring to Beijing
The volleys starting the economic war between the US and China were stunning and although the battle is still ongoing, in the long term the conflict between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing, say experts.
The first warning was fired this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariff rates on goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Each time Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike, and it does not appear that the second economy in the world is about to step down.
Obstructing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but a public bow before the United States would be too embarrassing for China's president, Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could strengthen China in the long term, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions to unleash economic chaos in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have so far admitted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher dealing with Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country ruined as a result of over seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been fulfilled so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can return voluntarily.
According to UN estimates, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid under conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seal the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has already lost sixth consecutively and since 1993 has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe regained its trophy when under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, gained 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, to whom most of the tournament did not go well, hit the football from the stand straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all rounds and became one of the four players to whom since 1979, when this tournament was first held in the current format, we managed to get a score of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a score of 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes in front of the last hole with Englishman Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the highest number of wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who had already taken part in eight such tournaments and gained 25,5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's the success of the whole team and I'm glad I could help," said moved Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He passes the baton to his countryman, John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2&1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has scores of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unusual statistic, for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and stepped down only to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played on a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance of the American lineup, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At one point this morning we pressed some Europeans.
We've retreated.
Hats off before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than we did."
Information about the flower — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota the density of plankton decreases
The latest Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission report shows an overall decline in plankton density in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of a grumpy flower was reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its densities were decreasing.
It extends about 209 kilometres [209 km] of the coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The blooms can be encountered about 16 kilometres from the Hillsborough County coast, but compared to the previous week in a smaller number of places.
The flower was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there was an average concentration of plankton off the coast and in Pinellas County waters, low to medium off the Hillsborough County coast, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high off the coast and Sarasota County waters, natural to medium in Charlotte County, natural to high off the coast and Lee County waters, and low in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week, however, they were not reported in northwestern Florida.
