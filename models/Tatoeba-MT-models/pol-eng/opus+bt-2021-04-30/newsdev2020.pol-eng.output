Bosnia and Herzegovina's plans for the landfill of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-western Bosnia in protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in Bosnian Novi Grad demanded Croatia to abandon plans to build a landfill in former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared to fight the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us", said that a radioactive waste dump could threaten the Unia River and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say no,
told the Miroslav Drljaca crowd, mayor of Novi Grad municipality.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT stated on Friday that it had not yet been decided in Croatia whether to build a landfill on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find a different location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why does Croatia say that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place in the area?” Drljac asked.
We can't let them humiliate us!

U.S. Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The U.S. Congress by statutory 15 days after the State Department approved the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multitasking fighters did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the purchase negotiations began.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After the State Department's approval of the sale, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior defense politician of the Washington, conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days before the signing of the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of arms to the NATO Member State, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if the transaction is finalized – will be the American defense company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of F-35A fighter engines for Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were made in May by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during a meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalized, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland's bid for the purchase was – without weapons and technical assistance – about $89.2 million.
According to PAP, American military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, such a price given in the initial negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated."
"Prices are dropping rapidly, now the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than it costs Eurofighter, which does not have the advantages that F-35 has", indicated Venable.
The PAP speakers expressed the hope that Poland's final negotiations on the purchase of American combat aircraft by Poland would end this year.
The potential participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – or offset – will be discussed directly with American fighter manufacturers F-35.
What is Münchhausen's replacement band referred to in the TV series Payton Hobart's Election on Netflix?
Caretakers and parents with the above disorders pretend that their healthy child eats sick.
The series "Payton Hobart's Elections" will be on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become President of the United States of America, but first has to become head of student self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, the creators of "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we will see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had a chance to see the show, he addresses the subject of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome – a mental illness occurring in caregivers who act as if a healthy person who has been affected by physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. Münchhausen syndrome, which causes symptoms of a particular disease.
Münchhausen's replacement syndrome consists in simulating that the person who remains in our care has some ailments.
It is also called an imaginary and induced disease, and is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms, so that it looks like his child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but the NHS points to the following examples:
Convincing medical personnel that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Overdosing or inventing symptoms.
Counterfeiting the results to make the child sick, e.g. giving glucose to urine samples to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Cause symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often does Münchhausen's replacement syndrome occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of the disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 indicated that over two years there were 89 cases of this disorder in 100,000 people.
What should be done if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?
Please contact the local branch of special services or call the NSPCC Children's Protection hotline by dialing 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid on school in Kaduna, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – Kaduna State Police Station raided Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal School yesterday, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi Local Government Area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were in highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities deny that.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a minister at school, said: “They do not tell the truth because all the children were there with the permission of their parents.
Before the children were admitted to school, the parents signed the form.
Every day, parents brought their children food and knew what the conditions were.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of all student food delivered by the parents before the school closed.
It's not fair, because parents can testify that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of childcare, had never had reservations.
He claimed that the children were studying the Quran and nothing else.
However, Public Relations Police Officer Yakubu Sabo felt that after the state government was handed over, the children would join their parents.
‘They were kept under dehumanizing conditions on behalf of the surrender or acquisition of kranical knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
That's why we're studying the school to meet its owner," he added.
Foreign talents important for China's development
Guangdong is a leader in the country in terms of attracting foreign talents largely due to the Belt and Trail Initiative (BRI), the Gulf Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group interviewed seven expatriates between the ages of 10 and 70 in Guangdong.
Originated in Singapore, Yash, born in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, said he would like to pursue his dream of becoming a scientist and doing a PhD in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandro, a Russian-Chinese student at Shenzhen MSU-BIT, said: “With the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
Together we can create new concepts and new ventures.
Rachel Rommeswinkel of the United States started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over a million fans on Bibilibi and Weibo.
She said that in her videos she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology.
Leticia de Lassus of France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI centres in Guangzhou agrees that “children's education is like wearing a jacket.
If you incorrectly button the first button, the rest will never come to the right place.
An American of Chinese origin Henry Xiao believes that in the very centre of the GBA area his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The producer of the culinary program "Nanta Show" Sean Choi of South Korea said that the Guangdong region's cuisine is known worldwide and the introduction of the "Nanta Show" program in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler of Switzerland working as Technical Director for Quality at Pearl River Pianos believes that the secret of high quality lies in the proper performance of simple works.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products, and strive for ever better results.
Survey: Poles want to resign Banasia
Most Poles want to resign the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasia, according to a poll by Kantar for TVN.
On the question "Should the chief of NIK Marian Banaś resign," 55% replied "yes" – including 34% indicated the option "yes" and 21% said "more or less so".
The answer "I don't know/difficult to say" was selected by 26 percent of the respondents, while the resignation was opposed by 19 percent – 8 percent indicated "decidedly not", and 11 percent said "not so".
Marian Banasia's resignation demands appeared after the release of the coverage "Przeczny Marian and hotel per hour" in the program "Superwizjer".
The material shows that the head of NIK was in the owner of a building in Krakow, where the hotel was to operate for hours, and the gangsters conducting it were to rent a tenement house for their business at a price lower than the market price.
Following the disclosure of the material Banaś announced that on September 27 he would go on free leave until the completion of the checks on his property statements conducted by the CBA.
The Kantar phone survey was carried out on 25–26 September 2019 on a nationwide representative sample of 1,005 people over 18 years of age.
The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.

Alisha Marie says that when you try to make contact with the brand there are simple messages.
The interest in the company and the desire to be its ambassador must be demonstrated.
What did Alisha write when she applied for her first co-operation with brands?
"I like your stuff.
Let me know if you are ever interested in cooperation" – a message about this content sent as a beginner influencer. "It was not professional, but it was mine," she said.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be President
"I think Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," says Tomasz Siemoniak.
Deputy Head of the Civic Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in an interview with Polsat News spoke of a scandal involving the NIK chief.
"This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become a minister of culture from some entertainment business, not the head of NIK or the minister of finance.
Not someone who is responsible for billions, taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about the candidacy of Claudia Jachira.
"Anthony Macierewicz is on the list of the Law and Justice.
A man who didn't just say things, he did them.
He accused former head of SKW of spying on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why does no one call for Antoni Macerewicz not to be on the list?", he asked.
“People younger than us have different aesthetics.
I think that Jachira, who for one of the things she's already apologized for, also feels that sometimes she's exaggerating.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

According to the office, it was not necessary to bring tourists ahead of time.

Thomas Cook GmbH owned a 100 percent stake in Neckermann Polska.
"Abominable" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
A man dressed in a masking outfit grabbed a 12-year-old girl going to school from behind and dragged her into a dense brush in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was issued at his house, where officers detained a number of relevant items for the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty with regard to seven charges related to the attack and to another three concerning the seduction and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim was walking along the path, and when she looked back, she saw him suddenly come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged "stop, stop, stop," he grabbed her by the neck and forced her to enter the bush.
The man said: “Quietly, don’t shout.
Don't yell, or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in her right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable bands, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut it off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man reached work around 9.30, not responding to several texts and calls from colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and carried traces of grass and trees, and he himself claimed to have been involved in an accident involving an attack of rage on the road during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the embankment.
The man's conviction will continue on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race for the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement is a threat of increasing social inequality if, from an ethical point of view, the common good is not taken into account.
Pope Francis gave these words at a conference in the Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethicalists.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
Technology achievements in the field of war and the future of work were discussed, with machines playing an increasingly important role, and a case study of the Christchurch bombing in New Zealand was discussed and decisions made by social media-owners companies in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that the machines saved workers dangerous and monotonous work at the beginning of the industrial revolution.
However, he warned that the increasing dependence on robotic devices to make profits was a risk of depriving people of their dignity as a result of their work.
"If technological progress became the cause of ever more visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of humanity were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to undesirable retroversion to some sort of barbarity dictated by the law of the strongest.
The conference organizers expressed their hope of taking advantage of the expert knowledge of the participants and identifying possible future advisors to the Catholic Church in matters related to high technologies.
Martin Odegaard, a player loaned out from Real Madrid, puts fans in a euphoria with his impressive assist.
Martin Odegaard noted an impressive assist on Mikel Oyarzabal's opening goal.
Winning 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed to the top of the La League table and continues the streak of being undefeated on its own field in this year's season.
However, despite the failure of a single defeat this season in La Liga Zinedane, Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to the turbulent preseason period and the public quarrel with the Welsh star, Gareth Bale.
The situation reached the boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedane Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal – to some of them the French currently have plans, to others they do not.
Vinícius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the band.
However, this Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, caused a great stir, including an incredible assist in the La League match.
During the meeting Real Sociedad of Alaves, Martin Odegaard made an impressive assist with opening goal for Mikel Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad eventually won 3:0 in front of his own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right side, Martin Odegaard manoeuvred the player from the opposing team, setting up a net for him, and then sent an amazing pass per centimeter between the two other players and his teammate remained only to add a leg.
Willian Jose's second goal and third in the performance of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time with a penalty kick, secured a decisive victory for Imanola's subjects before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid just as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet fans' expectations.
Now, at the age of 20, Norwegian footballer finally feels confident on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of the name Sharad Pawar on the fraud of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank
Anna Hazare stated: “The name Sharad Pawar did not appear on the list when the case was handed over to me”
A social activist, Anna Hazare, did not hide the surprise of the fact that the name Sharad Pawar, president of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with a multimillion-dollar fraud at the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank.
The Investigative Agency of the Executive Directorate, in short ED, brought a case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar – former Deputy Chief Minister of State Maharashtra – and others in connection with fraud.
The Executive Director's information report on the case, the equivalent of the FIR police report, was submitted by the central agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The basis of the case is the FIR report by the Mumbai police, which lists the names of the former bank president, Ajit Pawar, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, the name Sharad Pawar was nowhere to be seen.
"How did his name come up, who gave it, only they know these things," said Anna Hazare on Thursday when he was asked about the ED case and the alleged connection of Sharad Pawar to the fraud.
Anna Hazare, critically assessing Sharad Pawar, expressed hope that the truth would come out as a result of an ED detailed investigation into fraud.
"ED will learn where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the anti-corruption demonstration.
Sharad Pawar denies that he had committed a criminal act and claims that he was in no way affiliated with the bank, as well as questioning the fact that the case was filed a few weeks before the planned 21 October Assembly elections in Maharashta.
The former Minister of the Union assured that he would not submit to the majesty of Delhi, explicitly referring to the central government led by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the Executive Director's case as politically motivated.

Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, child death.
These are dramas that cause a great deal of suffering and are difficult to understand.
We say, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that “God wanted so.”
Is it the Creator who sends us misery and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the gym terrifiedly.
"My son has no arms or legs!" he shouted to the doctor.
Parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is a world-famous evangelizer and motivational speaker who converts many people.
"I am proof that God is never wrong," Nick emphasizes.
“When suffering touches us, it’s hard to understand.
We're looking for reasons.
We ask: «Why did this happen to us?».
If we believe that God is in control of the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises, whether it was He who sent us sickness, misfortune...".

PO MP Krzysztof Brejza is suing Caesar Gmyz
"In connection with the campaign of lies of the Script TV I appear with a lawsuit against Caesar Gmyz", tweeted MP Krzysztof Brejza.
The reason for the lawsuit is a statement by a journalist named Caesar Gmyz on the TVP's TV show "It's past 20".
One of the leading leaders of SokomzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has a lot of experience in the organization of the hate department.
"People who know very well Mariusz Kozak-Zagodza – the founder of the «Hejterski» profile – are Kierwiński, Budka and Gierty", said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are social sites and profiles with memes and political jokes.
According to the "Networks", behind the profile of this title stands PR-Owiect Mariusz Kozak-Zagodza.
"We managed to find out that since April this year Mariusz Kozak-Zagodda has been employed in the Warsaw city office, in the marketing office", wrote a weekly magazine.
"Confederation" in Oława
At the market square in Oława, its meeting was organised by the electoral committee "Confederation".
The program was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski number 5 on the list, and Halszek Bieleck number 9.
The announced list leader Krzysztof Tuduj did not arrive at the electoral rally.
The candidates raised many problems – from excessive fiscalism of the state to health care problems.
The issue of the economic zone, which should work for all entrepreneurs, rather than favour foreign capital, was also raised.

Boris Johnson addressed to police supervisory authority in connection with a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC Police Investigation Office will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister whether, in the course of his public office as Mayor of London, he has committed abuses that constitute a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) made a statement that its Supervisory Inspector had registered a "issue related to the conduct" of the Prime Minister in connection with allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri intended to result from their close relationship.
"The question of conduct can be referred to when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
That doesn't mean that it's proven somehow.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this case.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police services in England and Wales.
It was transferred to this police supervisor because Johnson was then the equivalent of a police commissioner and a criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.
He had earlier said that he would comply with the London City Council's order and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted that the Council "focused on the wrong problem."
The warrant is a consequence of the "The Sunday Times" report that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received £16,000 from budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, at which she was headed by then mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government had frozen a £100,000 grant to Arcuri-owned Hacker House pending the case.
The government is faced with troubling questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds are granted.
Digital Minister Matt Warman said in the House of Commons that the staff of his department "usually retained due diligence" and that the company has a British telephone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the call to the number was rerouted to an office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently to live.
The Prime Minister's close relationship with the businesswoman "was a secret to the staff of the polyshinel".
GLA's decision to refer the PM's case to the IOPC's independent police investigation office met with discontent at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of a higher-ranking government representative, it constitutes a "politically motivated attack", and its deadline, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference, is "clearly political".
"The Supervisor has not provided any evidence to support the allegations, and the Prime Minister has not received a chance to reply before publishing a press release late on Friday night," the source claims.
Neither citizens nor the media will fall for such a clear political bill.
Earlier today, journalists of "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businesswoman, who was assisted by the agency for tourism and promotion in London, was a "polyshinel mystery" for employees.
The London & Partners (L&P) agency's senior staff recalled that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's foreign business trips as mayor despite the fact that at the time its companies were not considered "reliable".
Third charged with drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – Due to last year's death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills treated with fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for "epidemia", which consumed several thousand human lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit was receiving drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who had been arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected to be Walter's "curier" who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly accused of manslaughter of Miller and none of them presented a line of defence in their case.
Walter, subject to a conditional release in the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months in prison for violation of the terms of the exemption.
The prosecutors on the case, first reported on Thursday by a website dedicated to the celebrities of TMZ, demand that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the defendant escaping.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine didn't come right away.
Pettit was charged with federal court charges on September 4, and his defenseman refused to comment.
The words of Miller's rhymed works are an honest conversation about his depression and the use of drugs, thus gaining fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
Originating from Pittsburgh Miller, who was really named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, he remained in a relationship for two years with singer Ariana Grande ending earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving film starring Miller and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the band 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of an overdose in 2016, and in his body was found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This article introduces a change: Walter's correct spelling is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games for mobile devices
A 9-year-old creates a fun hide-and-seek game using a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices using it.
Today's game features a bat that hides according to the program.
The player scores every time he catches a bat that comes out of the safe house.
I learned how to make games on an accelerated course.
"Now I make them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, Dad enrolled him on a five-day accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and received a scowl for spending all his time on games.
"One day he played the tablet, as usual, and was so consumed with it that I got upset," said the father.
Out of anger, I said, "You're still playing, can't you think about creating your own games so others can play them?"
Saying those words, I was upset and I didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning to create his own games, urged his parents to buy a laptop and save it for a course during which he learned the basics of creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his thunder titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were praised for using codes to create robots separating their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from a female high school in Ghana won the 2019 Robofest competition for programming robots to train boxes.
And thanks to growing investments by giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his peers are on their way to the career of coding stars.
Former Chairman of the Republican Party in North Carolina will confess to lying about corruption
According to court documents filed on Friday, the former chairman of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of a major political donor.
According to the wokanda, Robin Hayes is due to plead guilty next Wednesday.
A document containing the factual basis, prepared in the framework of a defense agreement and signed by lawyer Hayes shows that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense settlement has been sealed, and the factual basis does not indicate which Hayes' allegations will confess.
He was initially accused of collusion, corruption, and false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the insurance company's government plan to direct campaign donations to the country's main insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates were charged with attempting to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment company, being in recent years one of the main state political donors who has donated over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mainly supported the objectives and politicians of the Republican Party, however he also donated donations to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to a Friday e-mail requesting comment.
Defender Hayes Kearns Davis did not reply to Friday's email requesting comment.
According to court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about the state's insurance department employees.
According to a document containing the factual basis, Hayes actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request for changes in the personnel employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to April's indictment, Lindberg required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million to Causey's re-election campaign in 2020.
It appears from the indictment that the collusion also included a request to change the department official who controlled Lindberg's company.
As a Republican, Causey reported an alleged attempt at corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence on the case.
No charges were filed against him.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's associate ordered Hayes to donate $250,000 to the Causey campaign during a conversation where Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of that amount of money would attract attention, but, according to the prosecution, he eventually stepped down.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The U.S. Attorney's spokesperson did not respond to an e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.
The drivers will take the first episode of a new dig.
From Saturday, drivers will be able to use the first three mountain-built sections of the S7 expressway, the new Zakopaneka – from the Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój and the further two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
On Friday, the spokesman for the Kraków branch of the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) Iwona Mikrut stated, it is the first of three sections built S7 south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into service.
From more than a 6-kilometre stretch from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka over a third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, she was led on viaducts.
Seventeen of them were created, including the longest and highest, numbering a kilometer long and 50 m high, and four small objects on the drains at the Skomielna node.
From this junction there were exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to national road No. 28 and to the old course DK7.
From the next junction, Zabornia, you can take DK47 towards Nowy Targ and Zakopane and DK7 to Chyżny and the border of the state with Slovakia.
On Zbójecka Góra there was a place of service for ILO travellers.
The expressway ends with the Zabornia junction in Rabka Zdrój, to which approximately a kilometer two-way fragment of DK47 was added to Chabówka and there it was incorporated into the existing two-way Chabówka – Rudzawka.
S7 Skomielna Biała episode – Radka Zdrój and a new section of national road No. 47 of the accelerated main class (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment was approximately PLN 615 million.
The quality of the work performed will be guaranteed for 10 years.
Counting about 16.7 km, a fragment of the new Zakopaneka, including 15.8 km with expressway parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubień – Repair, Repair – skomielna Biała and skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first episode to enter the tunnel is performed by the Polish-Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section – the Italian company Astaldi, and the third one – the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is nearly PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over PLN 1.3 billion.
A total of 38 engineering objects (bridges, viaducts, estakades) and a two-chamber tunnel with a length of 2.06 km are created throughout this section.
According to the announcement of the road manager, a 7.6-kilometre section of Lubień – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7 will be available this year, which drivers will avoid the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – Komielna Biała with a length of about 3 km, drivers will travel in 2021, after the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of about 2.06 km.
Our goal is a state of prosperity.
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland", announced Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to persuade the vote for Councillor Dariusz Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
"The program of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the state of prosperity", said the minister.
“We want Poles to make much better money, so that their lives are on a higher level.
It is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that it committed to perform four years ago.
We said we'd put in place a 500-plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kopcz said it was impossible that this money just didn't exist.
We proved that the money was and was, only the PO did not care about those to whom they were to go."
Ziobro also recalled the expedition for children and the thirteenth pension – and that the 14th pension is also planned.
In addition to the "shrewd distribution of national income", the priorities of the Law and Justice are a fair state and economic development.
Money should not go down into the pockets of the chosen, who have good relations with the establishment and power, but should evenly reach the whole society," said the politician.

Part of Sopocka Street in Nisko after expansion
On Tuesday, September 24, an extensive Sopocka Street in Nisk was handed over to operate.
The total value of this task amounted to PLN 803 thousand, of which PLN 26 thousand was co-financing from the FDS, while the remaining amount was the own contribution from the Niżański District and the Municipality and the City of Nisko.

Facebook will hide the likes counter as a user’s concern
As part of the first experiment in the world to improve the well-being of users, some users of Facebook soon will not see a meter of likes, reactions and video views under other posts.
Likes will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, the privacy director of Facebook in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on well-being and the opinion of mental health professionals indicating that the like counter can lead to comparison with others.
"Many anti-harassment groups, as well as mental health organisations, have responded," said Garlick.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of content, not on the number of likes or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and will not be perceived as a rivalry," she said.
Garlick assured that companies that base their activities on Facebook would continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram, when the test included Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be permanently implemented.
"Users' initial comments on the new rules on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Speaking about the site of the global experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with meaningful opinions on whether or not the new experience is valuable for those using our services.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation from the curia for pilgrims
The Częstochowa curia does not comment on the appeal of the councillors to Archbishop Wencesław Depo there for the transfer of financial compensation for the operation of the waste economy during the pilgrimage season.
The city requests PLN 1 from a pilgrim.
The address addressed to the metropolitan was on Friday at a press conference attended, among others, by Spring Leader Robert Biedron, organized on Jasna Góra Częstochowa Avenue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Vice-President of the city council and candidate for Parliament Łukasz Kot.
Kot reported that the day before the local councillors of the SLD had voted on the appeal to Archbishop Wenceslaw Depo to hand over one golden city from each visitor to Czestochowa a pilgrim – to support the work of city services, municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean up after pilgrims, to prepare a city for pilgrims.
"We ask you to transfer a symbolic gold from every pilgrim to the city's budget.
This will enable the city to provide better conditions for their stay in Czestochowa," said Vice-President of the City Council.
Fr Mariusz Bakalarz, who was asked to comment, initially prepared a few responses, but then asked – as he signaled – to replace it with information about the content: "We do not refer to the case until we have received the official position of the city council".
According to the project on the pages of the Częstochowa Magistrate, the appeal to archbishop Depo concerns "the transmission of financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of handling the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, given the city's image among residents and residents, flower buds and doughnuts, we wish, within the framework of generally accepted canons, to take care of our common welfare, the small homeland of Czestochowa, to propose participation in the costs of handling the above-mentioned garbage system", is a fragment of the appeal.
"In order to maintain in proper condition the cleanness of the walking and road tracks which pilgrims move, while using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste baskets, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim", it is written.
"In addition, in connection with participation in annual costs which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and wishing to emphasise that such cooperation will bring benefits to all parties, we declare that 20% of the above-mentioned amount will be spent on improving tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available," declared the councillors.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial issues, their proposal stems from numerous objections made by residents about the cleanliness of the routes that pilgrims are travelling.
" Bearing in mind the cleanliness of our city and the positive effects of cooperation as possible, the City Council of Częstochowa calls on the Archbishop of the Metropolitan of Częstochowa Wencesław Depo to provide financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season", was repeated in the appeal.
According to information from the press office of Jasna Góra, 834 thousand people attended this sanctuary in 200 nationwide pilgrimages throughout the year.
About 124,000 faithful arrived in 255 pilgrimages of pedestrians.
Over 8.8,000 people came to Częstochowa in bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the sanctuary on horseback, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on roller skates.
"News" TVP omitted the Confederate when describing the poll
According to a study conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the Law and Justice Parliament he would gain 45 percent of the votes, KO 26 percent, Left 14 percent, PSL 7 percent, and Confederacy 5 percent.
The electoral threshold was even written on the "Super Express" portal for which the probe was conducted.
The main edition of "News", describing the same survey, presented the results of only the first four parties, completely ignoring the Confederacy.
Edyta Lewandowska, who was leading, made it clear that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and would have entered the Sejm.
TVP viewers were also shown the division of parliamentary seats without taking into account the votes cast by the Confederacy.
This would give the Law and Justice self-government.
Krzysztof Bosak, in a commentary on the situation as a whole, spoke of "public disgrace in the question of fairness to society".
"They started with slogans about the «moral revolution»", he recalled and stated that this case was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki tweeted that "«TVP News» in subsequent actions against the Confederacy embarrass Urban and Michnik".
He also pointed out the lack of reactions from right-wing journalists.
“But let us also look at those who acceptably remain silent.
These «right», «independent», «indebted».
In a few years they became a more primitive version of everything they supposedly fought," he added.
Ms Margaret Motylow Vice President of NIK
On Thursday 26 September, Speaker of the Sejm Elżbieta Witek handed Margaret Motylow the act of appointment as Vice President of the Supreme Chamber of Control on 27 September 2019.

"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Sejm, he was addressed to the Sejm Commission for State Control, which gave him a positive opinion on 26 September," recalls the communication.
"Also on September 26, 2019, NIK Vice-Presidents' positions were cancelled: Ewa Polkowska, Wojciech Kutyła and Mieczysław Łuczak", announces the announcement.
Earlier that day, requests for all these personal decisions were welcomed by the Parliamentary Commission on State Control, except that the vote on the opinion to dismiss Ewa Polkowska was carried out twice – in the first vote on the committee the same number of Members were in favour and against.
The new vice-president of NIK Małgorzata Motylow is from Chełm Lubelski.
Brother sentenced to life sentence for the murder of honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos published on social networking sites, was strangled in July 2016.
Brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment as the loudest "honor killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – polite according to Western standards, but in heavily misogynistic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and declared that he "obviously" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood passed on to the AFP that a court in the western town of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be acquitted by a higher court," he said.
Prior to that, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder came to the forefront of world news services and resumed calls for action against the epidemic of so-called honor killings, in which victims – usually women – are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for such offenses as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family “the shame” by demonstrating their own sexuality.
Murders are usually done by a close relative.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (bloody money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted new legislation introducing a life sentence for honor killings.
However, whether murder will be considered an honorary crime remains the discretion of the judge, which means that murderers may theoretically rely on another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first pressured their son in no way to show mercy.
However, they are devastated to think that they may also lose him, change their mind, and declare that they desire his acquittal.
The international outrage caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself heir along with its parents, thus forcing the case forward.
One of Baloch's more famous accomplishments is to offer stripping in front of the Pakistani cricket team and putting on a decolletted purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as breaking down restrictions in a country where posing as a character modeled as Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political move to empower women.
The roots of the "honorable" killing lie in tribal social norms, which continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular regulate the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from northwest Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations reported that increasing violence has caused the number of displaced people from north-western Nigeria to double to around 40,000 in the past four months.
The UN Refugee Agency has stated that unrest has created a "new emergency humanitarian situation" which requires an interagency effort to raise new funds of $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north of the country for a decade, was not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of the actions of organised armed groups.
"This paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told journalists on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders, and sexual assaults from attackers who also destroy homes and steal possessions.
The military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is detached from fighting Boko Haram and the Islamic State's branch in West Africa, which separated from its former group in 2016.
"Refugees do not come with the names of groups," he said.
But they come with terrible stories.
Refugees mostly enter neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that he expected more people to flee to Niger in the coming months with a deteriorating security situation, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for a man accused of killing a woman and two children.
A new date of trial was planned for a Guatemalan man accused of killing a resident of the State of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Polk County District Court file, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under, as authorities say, a false name he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to police, he fatally shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
The court file shows that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials claim Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson in the face of a cabinet mutiny wanting to lower brexit demands and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country in the presence of the Prime Minister, there is growing concern that he will not have enough time to achieve more important concessions.
Boris Johnson faces a risk of mutiny from a cabinet wishing to lower demands in relation to the brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The negotiations had a deadlock on the new customs system to replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels identified proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "not feasible".
The Crown Ministers expect EU decision-makers, headed by German head Angela Merkel, to offer the criticized Tories leader a compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
"The Sun" journalists spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual tories conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominic Cummings, consisting in attempts to use bluffs against the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then accept the last-minute offer made by the Union.
One cabinet minister defined the devastating verdict of the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday to end the suspension of parliament as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way we leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of an agreement.
We will never overcome arithmetic in the House of Commons, which works against us.
The Prime Minister must now bow down and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious Cummings' plan burned down.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister undertook to hand Johnson over to try to push through the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else failed.
The minister said, "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-present in the House of Commons the agreement proposed by Theresa May."
There are many chances that she will be voted on, and everyone is very keen on ending the subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a nibbled speech, the first Tory Minister said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he wrestles with bulls in Scotland, checks eggs in Wales and fights with citizens on the main streets of cities – everything in front of the world, as if the election campaign had already lasted for good."
A spokesman for the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still distant, and added: "No one should be deceived: to ensure an agreement a very long way."
However, the spokesperson also said that the Benna Act implementing the brexit postponement by three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said, "There is no doubt that this bill is making it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and her colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how the zone works for all of Ireland for food and food.
A noseless dog with no nose and leg is winning Instagram.
Perfectly Unperfect
The mutt was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal at first sight.
"Initially, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt, because we had three dogs already," she said.
The woman made a decision that she would take care of the bitch until someone didn't adopt her.
Still no one came forward.
“The fact that no one wanted it made me want to take care of it more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Eventually, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
“Our Bonnie is perfectly unperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, that's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a star of social media over time.
More than 14,000 netizens are watching her on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career on television
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV executives said that due to an accent from Glasgow he would "never make a career" as a presenter.
Reminiscing her 35-year career in the television industry Kelly, age 59, admitted that before her first appearance on the screen she felt "a lot of anger."
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a search and checking specialist, the chief of chiefs said that by my accent with Glasgow I would never succeed on television.
I went to London to meet the entire TV-am team and watch the show before I took over my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget an interview with star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to stay.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV-am correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then began running programs such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to later launch with her morning program "Lorraine", which he took by her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will mark a special program during which she will remember her best-remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret to her long experience on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiousness", adding: "You have to work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was “very difficult” for her to report the Dunblane bombing.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children watched our show live from Dunblane the day after the terrible killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting during which we talked for hours at her house.
The whole meeting was held quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral where I attended.
She added that the "extraordinarily difficult" was the interview with Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in 2007 and that she "really admired their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they do not know what happened to their beloved daughter, and also endure the most horrible comments of online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The program for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television will start at 8:30 on Monday, 30 September at ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
A senior state official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the offer made by the late President Robert Mugabe at the height of the coup as he feared imprisonment to confirm the takeover of power by the military in November 2017.
As reported by "The Zimbabwe Independent" last week, Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga the presidency during his negotiations with the military as part of the coup.
However, a senior state official stated on social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer out of fear, but because he reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during the coup.
In a Twitter post which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga, not President Emerson Mnangagwa, Jamwand 2, on which state officials confirmed that he was a senior state official at the President's Office and Council of Ministers, it was claimed that intensive negotiations were taking place at the time.
State officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was slipping from his hands.
Mediations between military authorities and the deceased former president, according to a senior state official, had three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was President George Charamba's spokesman, the person who was then the head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nhepera and a clergyman representing Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe bank, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to pass on the offer of Chiwenga's presidency, which was head of Zimbabwe's Defense Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death even more than he was considered an icon of Africa, tried in vain to get the AU to condemn military action, trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) of Chiwenga, was not by choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took off dangerously fast pace, removing some of the deceased's family," wrote an official (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation with which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-democratic way.
It is sufficient to recall that the commanders have declared that they have not overturned and overturned the constitutional order, which would have caused their conflict with the AU's stance on the coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, abruptly interrupting the leaders' claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the AU, which, by the way, was still highly confused by the whole situation and the way it fits into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in that spirit that the offer was made with such confidence.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defensive forces were no longer showing readiness to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the strongman that he was risking a Gaddafi-style lynching.
The military chiefs told him that they would not return the rifles against the citizens if they moved to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, that is to save his family and prove that the military took over," added the official.
At the time, the SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The Emissary (Gono) carrying this desperate message was given to the understanding – through a powerful metaphor – that the isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the sect of camouflage, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we compete with each other at political level, claimed a senior state official.
State officials say that the military notified military commanders in the area via attaché, who were in Zimbabwe, that they were not going to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the "criminalists" surrounding it.
Mugabe attempted to use the same strategy to tempt Mnangagwa again to return from a short exile in South Africa so they could talk about a coup and succession.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The people of South Africa, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma was President of Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the military invaded Mugabe's house, as many times threatened in the background, South Africa's troops would immediately arrive in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said a certain whistleblower.
China needs strong leadership or it will "break up" as stated in the policy document
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, or the country will fall apart," stated the government in a policy document issued on Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The press office of the Chinese government reported in the White Paper that the country's successes since the Communists took power 70 years ago came down to the party's leadership.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, and there are few difficulties of administration here.
The document mentions that without a unified and strong leadership, China will move towards division and decay, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long applied a hard-handed policy in solving problems, as in the case of suppression of pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, the strong-armed president, who will be at the forefront of the anniversary of the world's second-largest economy on Tuesday, has further tightened the party's rule and sanctioned those who may question power since his office at the end of 2012.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation program that has upset the region.
The document states that China is not trying to export its development model or to import any foreign models, seeking only peace rather than "hegemony".
The Chinese do not have other nations or world domination in their genes.
In modern times China was oppressed by the great powers, and wars and unrest left a deep mark on them as a result of the sufferings suffered; China will never inflict on others the sufferings they themselves suffered.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country embroiled in a bitter trade war against the United States and facing challenges due to the slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in China's subordinate Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to a solution to the problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market location and a strong economic growth rate.
The document adds that "trade wars will never weaken it".
China is sure to be able to face difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should rationally look at China's development as China does not intend to challenge the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop China's development.
The reduction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
Jack Pałkiewicz's World: Dubai, the Real Face
The Dubai emirat is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, religious Islamic radicalism and progressive extremism.
This trend-setting leader of world tourism stimulates imagination and desires, engulfing the vanity of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting fortune-seeking investors and merchants with the status of a tax paradise.
Websites infect this city with the enthusiasm of dreams, an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentrate of 21st century architecture in one.
Created on oil-rich sands, the emirat has become Eden for those who love excesses, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many delight in the ubiquitous here, appreciate the creative hyperactivism and the hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto is to “surprise, stun and charm.”
Almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, "the full extremes and contradictions of the metropolis took on the dimension of a tacky grotesque".
It has evolved into a futuristic nightmare, entirely dominated by the "Book of Guinness Records", the unofficial constitution of the emirate.
Because everything here has to be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
But among the excess and ostentatious excesses, there is something missing that may not be transparent in old Europe, but important to the quality of life.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid everyone feels like they are in their home.
And not in Dubai.
Running away from the world of witchcraft, I broke his golden mask, revealing the second face of artificial paradise.
A face you don't talk about and write about.
I show the poverty of the Asians contrasting with the fairy tale living conditions of the divine ethnic caste of the Dubaians, the grandchildren of the illiterate Bedouins.
I go to a place of extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where under cruel conditions there is an army of Asian workers.
They were the ones who built Manhattan's desert sky under slave conditions in one generation.
They came here in good money and the ability to provide a decent life for their families, and there was a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai over the years.
Increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labour a highly cumbersome issue for the emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team banned diet talks from her home after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls team admitted that there was a ban on diet in her home after she herself struggled with eating disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
Sports Spice for years did not eat and "obsessively practice" due to the pressure associated with being a member of the world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences affect how she is raising her daughter Scarlet, which is why she “does not allow diets to be spoken of in her home.”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am starting to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one positive experience of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak in front of it.
Using a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with the magazine Women's Health Mel, who gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that during the days before the rise of social media involved in the press "disturbing" comments about her caused complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain groups of food products, practicing increasingly obsessively until I was underweighted," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A Picture That Shocked the World
A Polish girl and an American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
“Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", began his radio documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic days of September 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His account echoed widely in the West.
Warsaw President Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe, and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be anywhere where the Warsawers were.
400 aircraft and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan immortalized death, suffering, struggle to survive in the ruins of the city.
Just before his surrender, he and the embassy staff took the negatives out of the ocean.
He kept talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London, and even New York."
His shocking chronicles were watched by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the U.S. began preparing for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They made movies glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," said Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
A grand jury trial against former athlete accused of numerous rapes
There's a rape trial pending in front of the jury for the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, charged with numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, members of the jury proceeded to settle the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who turned 21 claims Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after these two acquaintances on Bumble's meeting page and the man sent the photo to the woman in which he presented himself naked.
The woman is one of six accusing Conaway of sexual assault in 2013–2018.
According to the accusers, hugging, which the woman agreed to, turned into rape, which was the case with her opposition.
Defenders cite conflicting relationships between women and memory gaps, and claim that the woman probably regretted that there was an intimate intimacy.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million PLN
The gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys could be viewed at the 10th edition at the Kielce International Bike Fair BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz has just received an Oscar for him at the World Exhibition of Custom Bikes in Las Vegas.
An unusual piece made a rave at the fair. - The bike is covered with gold chrome spray, underneath it is the highest silver sample.
It's an unusual shell made by a friend of mine from Żor.
"There's a seat, there's pedals, there's a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bicycle," his designer explains.
‘The bicycle caroster was printed on a 3D printer.
It's a cube forming a kind of vortex.
I came up with an idea for this model on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a card and hid it deep in the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was created for three years", added Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside there are batteries, wires, elements forming the structure.
It is hidden under the bodyline soaked in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's an engine hidden there, too.
The steering wheel for this bike was created a week before I left for the United States for the World Bike Show.
I couldn't quite figure out what that steering wheel was supposed to be.
She's making up for transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he concludes.
The gold-covered bike was appreciated in Las Vegas for the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
The Bay of Sydney surrounded by an opera building, the port of Circular Quay, the Luna Park theme park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge makes its significant contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, pumped annually into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
However, under the bridge lies the ugly truth.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country to which the volume of pollutants is affected annually equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools.
These horrifying statistics make one of our greatest tourist assets one of our dirtiest waters at the same time.
According to a new film material entitled "Sydney Bay – on top and bottom", the waters in the area of Australia's most popular city are full of cigarette butts, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay along with rain drains.
However, the largest component of our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a video published on September 27, with the publication of this film deliberately coincides with World Tourism Day.
It looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated escape rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that about 1560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and most of it flows into the bay through a storm drain.
"After such a powerful fall in the bay... it looks rather tragic," Dr. Dafforn said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, as 70% of plastic entering the ocean goes to the bottom of the sea.
"To me, unless you spend time underwater, you can't really realize what's in there," said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water themselves every year.
I think that if more people knew (what is under the water), they would just be terrified.
It's overwhelming... over half of what we find at the bottom is plastic mesh.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all that other trash we're pulling right out from under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways in which people – both locals and tourists – could help reduce the amount of plastic and residues entering our waterways.
"It must start at its source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better recover materials and be more aware of what we discharge in the sewers that eventually go to the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we are doomed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our food source.
But we can sort out this bay and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
Film material, funded by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its wider efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that often enter the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey conducted among 546 children aged 12 to 18 determined that 82% of respondents feel helpless against plastic waste, and 25% blame adults for the problem with waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans were increasing.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to ecological anxiety.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after volleyball match in semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy game.
Slovenians had a natural audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish volleyball players.
There was also much controversy among the judges who did not count four rebounds on the side of the hosts in one of the actions.
This happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen's subjects had a chance to bounce off rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and Poles eventually had to acknowledge the superiority of the rival, who would play in the tournament final after winning 3–1.
Ghana: Kaneshie merchants support Accra Psychiatric Hospital
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated 30 000 GH worth of food to the asylum in Accra yesterday during a brief ceremony held in Accra.
It is part of the activities of the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
The donations included, among others, various food items, fruit, soft drinks, biscuits, clothing, yams, paradise bananas, manioc and water bags.
During the visit, the group also spoke to several patients of the facility.
The event was attended by members of Accra Markets Limited management staff, association directors and queens of the mother.
Presenting the items, Mrs Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, president of the Women's Market Association of the Great Accra Region, announced that the donation is part of the group's regular charity activities within the framework of social responsibility.
She noted that supporting care for patients of the facility was necessary to show them love and to let them feel part of society.
Mrs Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow this gesture.
While accepting presents, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the hospital director, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be used well for the benefit of patients.
She appealed to other organizations for hospital support.
Google creates a cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the Operator of the National Cloud, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
Digitalisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions which were the basis of the project of creating the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, shareholders of this company.
The partnership between the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we set up less than a year ago, announcing the appointment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – digitization of the Polish economy and dynamics of its growth.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional sophisticated tools to implement it.
Using them, they increase their chances of getting promoted to the World League, which we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining them today strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and companies.
"The investment in the National Cloud Operator fits perfectly into the PFR strategy, as an important element of the country's digitisation.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it", added Paweł Boris, president of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland in the service portfolio will find all the key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", says Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
He adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for computing power necessary to process huge data sets.
VI National Senior Parade
At midday, on August 24, 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the 6th Seniors Parade "Matured Great" and the Generation Picnic, events organized by the Zaczyn Foundation, began.
According to Przemysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation: “Parade is a global phenomenon.
It has already passed through the center of Warsaw for the sixth time to show how large and diverse the community is.
Through the Parade we counter harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity".
The parade was led by a special two-story coach serving as a musical mobile scene, on which the traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wika appeared.
Participants in a joyful corvoda, at the second known Warsaw and world hits, passed the Jerozolimskie Avenues, Krucza Street to the Warsaw Insurgency Square, Mazowiecka Street to J. Piłsudski Square and Królewski and Krakowskie Przedmieście Street to the Warsaw University Main Campus.
During the march, which was attended by several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organizations from all over Poland, the colorful delegations were greeted with applause by numerous people gathered on the march route, Warsawers and tourists.
Two organized groups in the company's yellow and blue shirts took part in the parade from Legionowa.
The first representing the University of the 3rd Century and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name SAGA, i.e. the Senior Active Animator Group.
On the campus, the organizers prepared, among others, food stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering older people services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the stand of the Senior Style Seniors from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrwa, you could get tips and information about current trends in fashion 60+.
The stand also offered a workshop to learn how to move around the stage and pose for photos.
The culmination was a fashion show of Style Seniors.
On the stand of the National Voice of Senior there was the latest edition of the magazine and material concerning the campaign "Stop Manipulation – Don't buy at the presentation!".
The next stands offered beauty, movement, artistic and artistic workshops.
Several of them could be studied and consulted with specialists on health and nutrition issues.
Discussion panels with the participation of Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadli, Mariola Boyarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow or Robert Janowski were also organized.
The picnic did not lack vocal and musical attractions.
On the stage there was a legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was an intergenerational dancing which led DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have the key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way to mask some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treating oncological patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treating fatal tumors within the face threatening the future of the threatened Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way of masking some cancer cells in both humans and margarines, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which disables a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This can be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and a type of skin cancer called Merkla cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance, we may be able to reverse the process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed towards re-incorporating markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
"This potentially has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And perhaps we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat tumors of the face of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
"So far, it has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian devil tumors.
But if medicines acting in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists astounded by the fact that there is a very large planet orbiting a really small star
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of the solar system 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the formation of planets, because in this system a large planet similar to Jupiter orbits a small star called a red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of the planet type gas giant GJ 3512b circulating around the central star being a red dwarf, published on September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 represents about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, or the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute for Space Research at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, which headed the research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of the formation of solar systems suggest that low mass stars usually become parent stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a gas-type planet similar to Jupiter orbiting a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full lap lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately under 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they're reddish," Morales said.
"There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet may have been ejected from the star system in the past, which may explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," Morales stated.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar gas and dust disc that gives birth to the star around which the planet is orbiting.
According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the model of the accretion, the object initially emerges from particles in the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet in the early stage of development allows the formation of an atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual arrangement can be explained by a competitive model called the gravitational instability model.
"In such a case, the protoplanetary disc around the young star may be a little more massive than we expect, and it may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to disk stability impairment, and thus some denser areas may appear.
These masses can grow until the planet collapses and forms.
Delicates employee accused of administering bean dip co-workers containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's Office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, for administering a bean dip co-workers containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, a 38-year-old from Albany, Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of providing methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The prosecution was based on a September 9 event held at a Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a statement made under oath by the OregonLive.com portal indicating the likelihood of guilt a 27-year-old suspect co-worker told the deputy sheriff of Marion County that during the lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez do the bean dip, which she then gave her.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she told the investigators, had never taken meth, said that "she thought that one piece she ate tasted strangely, but it did not raise any suspicions about it."
When she returned to work, she felt that she had a stomach upset and that she could not stand still.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital where it was established that bean dip could contain methamphetamine.
Based on reports from The Smoking Gun portal according to police, another employee of the Thriftway network said Medina-Hernandez "has told her that she will add drugs to the food," while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message claiming that methamphetamine had gone into the bean dip by accident.
OregonLive's website announces a surveillance footage from the deliites, which allegedly shows how the back of Medina-Hernandez's camera pulls something out of the bra, stands behind the microwave and bends.
It then straightens, wipes its nose, approaches the table and puts the dip bean in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
The Oregon newspaper Statesman-Journal reports that the sheriff's office employees claim that there is currently no suspicion that the customers will be given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in prison in Marion County – the designated bail is $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun portal, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, providing meth, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of unauthorised weapons.
Johnson strikes a blow in the adjournment confusion.
Boris Johnson's journey to the United Nations General Assembly was inelegantly interrupted by the historic ruling of the Supreme Court.
However, his devastating speech in the House of Commons did not betray any shame or remorse.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": castings for Jamie New's role at West End
Another big West End star is waiting to be discovered, though she doesn't know it yet.
Producers of the musical "Everybody's Talking About Jamie" are looking for another Jamie New and holding open auditions
The current star Layton Williams embarks with the musical on a UK tour, so the producers in his place are looking for "a uniquely talented, undiscovered young performer".
Hearings in London will take place on October 10 at Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 bars of the song opening "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CV and portrait photo.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and the following week before the producers there will be people invited to the presentation again.
Producer Nica Burns said, "We are happy to say that thanks to our fantastic audience, the musical will be played for another third year at Apollo."
We found some fantastic young performers to join Layton Williams and Shane Richie on tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical, we open up opportunities for unknown talents that will join the current young professionals.
Williams, who played the role of Jamie New in February and thus replaced John McCre's original role, encouraged on Twitter " ALL Boys to send their tapes":
The tour of this musical will start in February, and West End performances were extended until 29 August 2020.
The musical depicts the fate of 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the graduation ball in a dress.
He doesn't know what the future holds, but he's sure he'll be a star.
With the help of her mother and local legend of the Loco Chanelle drag community, she begins to discover her identity, resist prejudice and career in the light of flashes.
The music in this play was inspired by a BBC documentary entitled "Jamie. Drag Queen at 16" by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and lyrics by Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval acquires a commission in the natural gas industry worth SEK 110 million
Alfa Laval – a global leader in heating, centrifugal separation and liquid transport – has obtained an order to supply air cooler installations to a gas processing plant in the US. This order is worth about 110 million Swedish krona and has been registered in the Welded Heat Exchanger Department in the power sector and the deliveries are planned for 2020.
The order includes the installation of Alfa Laval Niagara air coolers, which will be used as part of the refrigeration systems for separating natural gas into individual streams of its pure components – ethane, propane and butane.
Safety is crucial in all industrial processes and is extremely important for demanding applications related to natural gas treatment.
"Our reliable systems of air coolers are appreciated because of their safe work, which provides peace of mind for natural gas customers," says Susanne Pahlen Aklundh, President of the Energy Department.
Did you know that... ethane, propane and butane can be extracted from natural gas and then used for example as input material for petrochemical installations, house heating or as fuel for vehicles?

What's the KAS doing about the NIK chief?
Renting property for an amount below the market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasia.
We asked about what the IRS is doing in the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in a coverage for TVN's "Superwizjer" presented doubts about the property statements made by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasia.
They've been investigated by the Central Anti-corruption Bureau for months.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banaś was to rent a 400-square-foot tenement house and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received PLN 65.7 thousand a year.
The report "Superwizjer" revealed that the hotel rented by him was housed for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on state television why he only charged just over PLN 5 thousand per month for renting the property.
"Gazeta Wyborcza", citing experts in property valuation, estimated that it should be PLN 15,000 per month for the building itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I made a preliminary agreement and it was precisely that the tenant was to buy this tenement that caused me to agree to a lower rent, that the remaining receivables would be settled when selling the tenement," Banas argued.
However, doubts arose as to whether such proceedings constituted a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a press spokesman for the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow, stated in an interview with TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"All such questions please address the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "the actions are carried out by the National Tax Administration".
Ministry of Finance press secretary Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Tax Administration itself monitors many cases that may raise some concerns.
"National Revenue Administration works in such a way that it has its own information, as well as based in a sense on those information that is available to the public.
On this basis, he decides whether or not to conduct any specific case,” explained the MF spokesman.
"However, due to the fact that we are all bound in the entire finance department by a tax secret, we never speak because we cannot speak on individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," he stressed when asked about the case of Marian Banasia.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "tax offices do not provide such news to the public".
"It is known that the entire treasury apparatus deals with a number of similar cases across the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the Royal Family: Surprising guests often flying a royal plane were revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world throughout their lives.
This is usually facilitated by a royal aircraft – a private machine that carries the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.
It is no surprise that having your own plane involves privileges.
Royal family members do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, their baggage limits do not apply, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests aboard – including really unusual ones.
According to the recently released Channel 5 documentary film, not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel in a royal plane.
During the program entitled "Secrets of King's flights", former air navigator of the Queen's flights revealed that furry guests often flew along with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes along with our very important royal guests could fly very important royal dogs."
It is not surprising that the queen may have wished that her beloved favorites accompany her on her journeys, as she is known for her deep attachment to corgi-bred dogs.
From an early age, Queen Elizabeth was a lover of these quadruped creatures, and it has been said that since the coronation she had owned more than 30 corgis.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corgi: Monty, Emma, Linneta, Willowa and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs being the cross between the dachshund and the corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the royal plane certainly had their hands full.
A royal household worker was seen walking dogs and asking them to settle their needs before taking them on board the plane," Shields continues.
It's nice to say there's never been an incident.
The program also reveals the shocking number of baggage that the Queen takes with her on board while travelling as part of her duties.
The film's narrator stated: "In 1953, the queen on her journey of 70,000 kilometres took baggage weighing 12 tons."
In order to better picture it, it's more or less the same as two giant elephants.
However, the Queen is not the only one with a weakness for fashion.
It is said that the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own tastes for carrying her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dresses has a separate seat.
The new bill is coming into force.
In the event of accidents, they will receive pensions
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that those seriously injured in the event of further payment of the pension,” informs the Financial Ombudsman.
It is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of victims in case the guarantee amount established under the provisions in force before 1 January 2006 is exhausted.
It concerns those who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the time there were considerably lower guarantee amounts than now, so in some cases insurers have already stopped paying out their pensions.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has been seeking for many years to create a mechanism that will allow the seriously injured to provide a guarantee of financial support from the insurance of the OC or OC of the farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount," says Aleksander Daszewski, legal advisor in the office of the Financial Ombudsman.
In the opinion of the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary, because it is often very tragic for people in very poor health who, due to accidents, cannot work, and at the same time bear significant costs after the accident of rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensation and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of so-called guarantee sums on OC policies.
Some of them threatened to do so in the coming years.
Until 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurer were significantly lower than the current limits.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years was most often affected by those who suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantee amounts were very low at the time, and economic conditions caused price increases.
"We have also noticed that this problem has also affected a number of young people who have suffered damage at a time when the sum was EUR 350 000 for each victim in the accident.
It is currently EUR 5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of victims.
So this is a huge difference compared to earlier periods, hence the problem required the intervention of the legislator", reminds Aleksander Daszewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee amount is increasing from time to time, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of the application for the pension to the Fund.
This rule shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay annuity on the basis of a court ruling fixing the amount of the guarantee sum other than that laid down in the OC insurance contract.
This is the case in the case of an increase in the guarantee amount by way of court pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing liability ratio.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to those who have asked us to intervene in the past.
We inform them about the new powers and, of course, we ensure that we can provide further support if any problems arise," says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off her boyfriend's penis
The case concerns events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed his friends the sex tape that was made in their bedroom.
A 28-year-old girl, who is an architect, explained to the court that the partner had thus ruined her life and treated her like a "trophy" to be commended to her friends.
“He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
Córdoba's apartment has decided to bring justice to itself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
With a velvet band, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the shears and cut off his penis.
“I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled up my pants, and I grabbed a cell phone to call 911," the victim testified.
“I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by revealing sex tape, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said towards the jury.
Eventually, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama State Congressman Jack Edwards died at 91
On Friday, a retired Alabama state congressman named for the Republican Party Jack Edwards, who served for his 10th term and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
Family spokesman said Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after fighting pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from Alabama State in the Deep South due to the party gaining supporters here.
He served ten terms in Congress.
According to a statement made by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its great-grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like the courtesy of returning.
"I hope that my great-grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will grow up in a country where kindness will return to the common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said, according to a family statement.
Alabama State Governor Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of integrity.
She added that in his honor the flags at Alabama State Capitol would be abandoned to half the mast.
"He was the personification of a true state official and was Alabama's best statesman.
Our state lost one of the most excellent politicians," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world a better one."
Princess and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether meeting Obama Foundation leaders @ObamaFoundation or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, posting a photo depicting smiling Meghan posing with the Foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September release of British Vogue, guest-edited by the former actress of the series "Suits".
In an honest conversation, there was a first lady talking about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means getting into the mastery of letting go," Obama said in an interview.
“My motherhood taught me that most of the time my job is to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want them to be, or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in their heart.
Obama, who in her experience knows the pressure of being on a candlestick, shared with the Duchess of the Council during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – imposed by yourself and others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
“My advice is therefore to slow down and not rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughter, making sure that they were doing well at school and making new friends before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think we need that, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains a permit to sell alcohol despite complaints about the owner's disposition
WARINGTON (AP) – The D.C. Alcohol Drink Control Commission has rejected the request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its licence to sell alcohol due to the owner's disposition.
The agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis was unfounded because most of them do not live in the district or have real estate in it.
"The Washington Post" states that for the second time these plaintiffs have sought to revoke the hotel's permission to sell alcohol, citing a provision in force in the district that states that applicants for a permit to sell alcohol must show a "good disposition".
In the initial complaint filed last summer, it was claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and accusations of assault and repeated cases of fraud were cited.
The complaint was dismissed as the permit was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the permit.
"The Sun": A crushing report finds Cleveland Police Service scandals the worst in the UK
Inspectors considered the police's compromised actions to be the worst in the United Kingdom.
In a crushing report, they assessed the Cleveland police work as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's chief police inspectorate claims that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in Cleveland police services.
There have been new calls for the dissolution of police services, led by five chieftains in six years.
According to the report, police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Inspectorate of Police said: "Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards."
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious", albeit undisclosed, allegations of his conduct.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared in front of the Offences Commission for equipping coworkers to engage in sexual activities.
He's out of the service.
Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen, on behalf of the Tories, said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time the Home Office department intervened now."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said, "After improvements I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces through changes."
We've got skatepark visuals!
Will young ones finally get there?
Older residents are disturbed by young enthusiasts of scooters and skateboards, and they complain that there is no place for them in Oława.
For years, young people have been asking for a place to skate, skateboard, scooters, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our cracks.
We have been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Lately, it's gotten a little bit loud about the lack of skatepark.
That's why we come back to this again and ask the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago there was a woman who was disturbed by young people driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the residents of the block at Piłsudski Square, so that one can be interested in the situation of Oławska youth", he writes to the editorial board of Małgorzata.
"The block's residents called the City Guard repeatedly unsuccessfully.
In proof of such everyday situations in connection, I send pictures".
We've asked the others what they think about it.
Most clearly state that young people simply have nowhere to go in the city and have been unsuccessfully demanding a place for themselves for years.
Under the Facebook post, there was an avalanche of comments.
As early as July, we wrote that there was a chance for skatepark to be built on the Oławski Town.
The mayor reported that the city requested funding for the construction of the skatepark.
"The young people are consulted on the project and the permits are ready.
On 28 March, a request was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding of the task entitled «Building Skatepark in Oława» as part of the Sportowa Polska programme", we were told at the office.
Total project value: PLN 798 306.00.
Subsidy requested: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we asked again at what stage the case was.
"We do not yet have information on the decisions concerning the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism", says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the Department of European Funds of Oława.
"The information obtained from the Ministry's staff shows that ultimately the selection of all tasks under the Sport Programme should take place in October".
We also asked for visualization of the Oławski skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editorial board that next Saturday (September 28th) they would collect signatures under the petition for the construction of a skatepark in Oława.
"The rebellious youth saw the last Facebook post and concluded that they would organize a fund-raiser," writes Santa.
The petition signatures will be collected from 12.00 in the area of Lidl Market.
2019/20 Polish Cup: 1/16 final draw.
We know couples, a hit from years ago.
It was one of the fiercest rivalries in the extra class.
The biggest legend grew a memorable match from the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, the Legion took up an old Łazienkowska Łazienkowska Łazienkowska Łazienkowska Łazienkowska Łazienkowska team in the penultimate line.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, Widzew gave the second consecutive Polish championship a point.
By 87th minute the Legion led 2:0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the Lodz club was getting into more and more trouble, until it stopped counting in the championship fight and fell from the top-class gameplay.
For the last time, both teams met at this level during the 2013/2014 season.
The Legion – on its way to the title – won two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 away.
Back to the elite
Today, Łódźmen are fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least one year, as in previous games they were one of the favorites they were unable to advance to the back of the extraclass.
As a result of this failure in summer, there was a staff revolution at the club.
The authorities have changed, eventually put on coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy, Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdzyń are supposed to help the league fighters.
For now Widzew is fourth in the 2nd league table, but in the Polish Cup he defeated the runner-up of the Śląski Wrocław 2:0 on Tuesday.
The Legion in the same sizes won at the departure of the Niepołomice Forest.
Extraclass start
The only pair made up of representatives of the highest class in the 1/16 finals are her benyons ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, the 1/8 final is scheduled to be played (3–5 December).
The final is scheduled to take place on 2 May at PGE Narodowy in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "rebellied" and an impeachment investigation must be on his way
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are participating in an attempt to conceal the facts of an attempt to conceal the facts, and the investigation may take time," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN at Hill Hill of Capitol.
"They will do the work they have started by sticking to the facts and the time necessary to find them," she added.
The protocol released this week by the White House shows that Trump asked the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenski to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on this matter, as the protocol shows.
Trump denied he had done anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that National Security Lawyers from the Justice Department had notified a complaint by the whistleblower concerning Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving a complaint as a complaint from officials at Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice stated that Trump's phone call did not provide criminal investigation into campaign financing.
When asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi stated that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call as a witness.
However, she added that in her opinion Barr "rebellied".
It's been like this for a long time.
"Barra is mentioned in all this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's reference to her Attorney General during a conference in July with the leader of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions about how the complaint was handled.
Pelosi stated that she was “very afraid” of whistleblowers, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past spies had been treated differently.
I think the President's words go beyond responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in discovering – exposing violations in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The President's words about people who can provide information signally seriously undermine the integrity of the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historic step in announcing a formal investigation into an illegal act based on allegations of attempts to exert pressure on the leader of a foreign state in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in a complaint published on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his power to "conquer Ukraine to interfere" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers had officials remove the record of the conversation from the computer system in which they are stored for the needs of officials of the Council of Ministers, and put it in a system designed for sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving for excessive speed for Crystal Palace club striker Christiana Benteke
The Premier League stars Christian Benteke, who has been caught speeding twice in the last two months, threatens to ban driving.
Crystal Palace's attacker, 28, admitted to driving a Bentley car at 80 miles per hour in an area with a limit of up to 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond, southwest London on January 20.
Then in March, Putney photoradiators in southwest London registered Belga driving at 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Benteke of Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to go to the Peace Court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He confessed to both offences in early July as part of a simplified procedure whereby lighter crimes are judged at a sitting held by a single judge of the room.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and club representative Sekondi Hasaacas, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming election to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The verification committee should consist of neutral external persons who show no link with any member and who have not previously shown an interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer regarding a 10 percent payment.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he has an interest in this," he claimed.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, were to appear before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President due to his association with the club, while suggesting that if he was to Palmer before the Commission, he would be subject to prejudice and bias.
As expected, the members of the Commission were to start work from yesterday, after being sworn in at a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and finish it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and her members are the Corporate Governance Consultant and Mrs Marian Barnor's lawyer and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on a government of unity
The two major parties of Israel, the Blue-White and Likud alliance, continued negotiations on Friday to establish a government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the president entrusted the mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not yield results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanjah as Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli newspaper "Haarec" writes, there was no approximation of views.
Talks will resume on Sunday.
The central Blue-White alliance reported in the Communication that it had put forward preliminary demands.
He accuses the right-wing Likud of having "found himself in his position", demanding that his leader and the current Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and in the cabinet's composition – formerly members of ultraorthodox politicians.
"From the very beginning it was clear that Blue-Whites would not agree to these conditions," says the message they published.
Likud, acting solely in the interests of Netanyahu, wants to "bring Israel to the second round of elections".
Blue-White Leader Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanyahu would lead as long as he is charged with participating in three corruption scandals on the basis of which the prosecution could formally prosecute him after a Wednesday meeting.
"Likud and Blue and White have obtained a sufficient majority in the September 17 elections, which would allow them to rule together as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate which neither party wanted," writes the EFE agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin sought to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed the establishment of a "rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take the position if the accusations against Netanjah were sustained and formalised.
There's no shortage of Israeli analysts who think things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll published by public television on Friday, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under rotational leadership alternately of Netanjah and Gantz.
This solution is supported by 50.6% of Israelis, 32.1 percent of those surveyed object to this solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – the question of who should be the first to take the lead in the cabinet, 41.8 percent of respondents advocate Netanyahu, and 40% advocate Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63%, 60% opposed to the new elections, which would be third this year.
In the early September 17 parliamentary elections, Gantz's alliance won, winning 33 seats in 120-seat Kneset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 tickets.
Netanjahu with his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 MPs, while Gantz – at 54.
None of the parties collected the 61 mandates necessary to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final match against the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that “it’s time to test yourself” when Wales faces the final gameplay with Australia as part of the World Cup that can shape their fate in the tournament.
Wales's victory over the "kangaroos" would put this team in the position of a certain favorite to win Group D and guarantee its participation in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be promptly sent off to take off with England as part of the one-eighth final.
"Let's be clear, both teams want to try to get through it and get at the head of the group," said Welsh ripper Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last fall it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they will be eager to take away this victory from us, and we are determined to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big fight.
And now we're here, and it's really time to prove ourselves.
Wales won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history – and this happened 32 years ago in a third place match when they defeated the "cangures".
And their total record under head coach Warren Gatland shows only seven wins in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the Southern Hemisphere.
Wales stopped a string of thirteen losing test matches at Australia's hands last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of this 9–6 win who would run for the stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric asked if the team had experienced a mental block before this victory, he added: “It is hard to say.
These games are so even that maybe... people are expecting some kind of mental block, I don't know.
At the end of the game, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks like a much smaller advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then the fight of Tipuric against the beloved Australian duo from the third mill line Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the stop and collapse will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 matches in the colors of the team and met both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's ahead of him.
"These are the players playing in the seventh absolutely world-class position," he said.
When playing against world-class players of the third line of the mill, it is always known that there will be a difficult match to play.
These two are constantly performing with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you'd expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and challenge each other than to face the third line of a mill that is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and by struggling with these two, you must surely be in peak form.
I wouldn't say Sunday's almost the final of the cup, but for us it's an important game in this World Cup.
The momentum is an important element of it.
When we build strength and constantly put great effort, we will fly like wings and it will be hard to defeat us.

"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were to be an elite organization of "gentlemen's race".
They accepted into their ranks those whom they despised.
Can a crime connect more than a national identity?
In your hands we don't give up another book on the subject of war or military.
We are giving a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different countries of Europe have analysed the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, reminded them of their activities and watched recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish troops differ from the French troops?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a branch composed of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative of collaboration in individual European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among these questions is the book "Waffen-SS" based on solid research material.
We sought to present a subtler and more balanced, closer truth picture of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological limits of the history and period of history by presenting trials by researchers from different countries. (...) While the fate of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, Slavic population - is sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are examined essentially from a national perspective (as far as they are done).
"Total panic" when the White House struggles to find arguments about impeachment
White House officials struggle to figure out how to repel the pressures on impeachment resumed on Thursday, and one of the interviewers familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This seems to exacerbate "anxiety, uncertainty and concern" – one of the people associated with the White House thus describes the mood in the western wing – that the informant's allegations could seriously harm the president and the people around him.
The person said, "There is not much certainty that nothing is hidden there."
White House officials were still uncertain how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of effectively avoiding controversy used by the president in the past may not work. "This does not seem to be something that will pass away with the arrival of the next cycle of message headers," the person joked.
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as a "state of shock" accompanied by increasing distrust that with the protracted investigation of impeachment the likelihood of the President responding irresponsiblely and becoming "difficult to master".
This fear is shared by another interviewer claiming that people around the president expect that he will display a more "continuous" behavior, and the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase every day of the impeachment investigation.
This creates concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behavior and explode in an unexpected way – this is in the context of the election year, both from the point of view of the presidency and the elections.
Faced with the greatest threat in the presidency so far, Trump circled from attack to defense, again reaching for a strategy he judged to be effective during the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He attempted to downplay his own request to the Ukrainian president for assistance in conducting an investigation into his political rivals in order to distract and direct it to the actions of Democrat and Democratic candidate Joe Biden and discredit the informant as a party-driven motive.
But while many people in the White House are trained in combat after Mueller's investigation, something has changed this time – said advisors and consultants.
The President, whose hallmark is strength, showed the press conference on Wednesday as defeated – stated one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine," they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informant did not have firsthand knowledge of the aforementioned controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski – which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as often happens when the president is the subject of attacks, this fact is raised alive by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House points out that the results of the support polls for the president are sky high, and the impeachment will not affect the acquisition of new sympathizers too much.
"There is no advantage in the need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if this makes his legislative agenda more difficult and prevails in the new cycle of news headlines.
Another interviewer says that those who claimed that the impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worried White House officials sought assistance from advisors, completing a response team to impeachment.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it is unclear whether any initiative in the style of the command centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leader able to launch a PR attack that is a repost for the publication of a virulent signal report and aimed at stopping the momentum of democrats on the impeachment given by the disclosure of the report.
An interviewer familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they had no intention of revealing a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no way out and that the document had to be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than in the course of Robert Mueller's investigation, who usually kept his mouth shut and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in developing an answer to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, the man from Trump's dirty work and former chief of the electoral staff – said the person associated with the case.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it was not true to suggest that he would lead the action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his program," he said, but I have not participated in any talks with the President or his team about joining the team in order to resist the false narrative about impeachment."
Donald Trump's private attorney from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in the impeachment activities.
"We respond to things right," Sekulow responded when he was asked by NBC News for comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, does not have that kind of experience.
A talker familiar with the White House strategy stated that generally officials did not plan to involve people at any point or create a command center, but admitted that there was a need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could lead a political struggle.
Excursion Explorer of the Seas Royal Caribbean line underwent renovation for £89 million
The explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will embark this summer on a cruise, presenting a completely new look.
After a renewal that took on an impressive $110 million (£89 million), the ship delights with a wide selection of culinary delicacies from around the world and a rich entertainment offer for the whole family.
This summer, Explorer will stop at the finest ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land comes to an end, the crew of the ship promises an unforgettable experience at sea.
With a satisfactory offer for everyone, Explorer after a renovation costing $110 million, or about £89 million, turned into a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the entire family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surfing simulators or watch their favorite family film, using the charms of the weather, as part of outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which allow indoor cabin passengers to admire ocean views without the need to board.
Water lovers will delight the newly designed deck by the pool combining the style of the Caribbean resort with the charms of the water park.
The swimming pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and sun loungers ideal for lying in the sun, and the two modernized slides are within reach of people who are thirsty for strong impressions on board.
The trip attractive to passengers of all ages impresses the number of activities at guests' disposal while travelling to destinations.
Created for toddlers, the Adventure Ocean for children is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and an exclusive place to spend their free time for teenagers offers super games and a music zone prepared for people over the age of 12.
If this is not enough, the whole family in the "Studio B" on the ship can face the laser tag game with the effect of glowing in the dark, which can also be impressively used as a skating rink.
During the Mediterranean cruise, guests will also have the opportunity to explore exotic tastes from all over the world, going to conquer restaurants on board.
Modernized Asian cuisine is offered on board in the restaurant Izumi, and in the freshly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is served excellent food inspired by an innovative look at traditional Italian cuisine.
The rest of the catering points on board include the American restaurant serving Chops Grille steaks, the Latino bar Boleros, Schooner Bar and the express bar Johnny Rockets.
The cruise, with an option of a seven- or nine-day tour, departs from Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship to be part of the Royal Caribbean line, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has also recently undergone an incredible renovation.
After the 58-day Allure metamorphosis, a total costing a gigantic $165 million, the cruise operator offered guests who had previously made a reservation, a $300 voucher to be released on board the ship.
The tour operator stated: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship to undergo transformation as part of the modernization of the Royal Amplified fleet."
The program, which requires investment of over $1 billion, covering 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unique attractions and gastronomic experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding "naked pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of the state of California apparently can't stand the naked truth about President Donald Trump being investigated.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused Democrats of wanting naked photos of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Commission, made the above allegation in the course of a preliminary statement during a hearing following a complaint by the whistleblower that Trump had asked Ukraine to assist in the initiation of an investigation against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque portrayal" of the left and their "medial ace" before stating that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the negligee.
"Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people who they thought were Ukrainians to receive naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the President on trial when they have their chance next year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimands, a political reporter on HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to check whether Democrats were really trying to... discover it.
So far, only Connecticut's representative, Jim Himes, has responded, although we suspect that his response is a naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
Mediaite.com portal suspects Nunes' naked comments referred to "certain more lewd and unconfirmed information" that likely appears in Steele's controversial files,
This is infamous, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that supposedly shows him watching a urinating prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be eluded by renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that allows renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Department of Agriculture, Life Sciences and the Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
His laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fatty waste such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from lower quality oils in production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than oil fuels, as well as using waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is intended to mimic hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," Bressler said, is [totally creating] hydrocarbons, which are identical molecules as in diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilize at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat for aircraft flying at high altitudes.
"The aviation fuel problem is a bit of a vicious wheel," Bressler said.
It's actually less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking at two options for producing aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spatter company formed by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to commercialise the product as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies increase investment in renewable option.
"They are able to imagine times when the situation may be reversed and a carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will constitute a contingency plan.
Currently Forge operates a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support a $25 million construction facility that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the assumed coal reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further coal reduction.
“As a technology specialist,” Bressler said –
I am tasked with developing options that allow informed decisions and many options to choose."
SURVEILLANCE: Another cheating on your granddaughter
PLN 8,000 and EUR 750 lost Zamość's resident thinking she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday the son of a defrauded marauder.
"A woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
The senior woman, wishing to help her grandson, donated PLN 8,000 and EUR 750 to a fake police officer who came to her house", reports Asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubiło from the Zamość police force.
Police are looking for the perpetrator, and once again they call for caution:
‘Any call for financial assistance shall be verified.
You should not act under the influence of emotion and in haste.
Remember, police officers don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling 911.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's tell them how cheaters work.
Let's ask for caution and not to trust people who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's covenants warn that in the event of the withdrawal of Britain's brexit they threaten ROOMS such as in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace of mind
One of the chief cabinet ministers said last night that the country is threatened with "violent social unrest" if the initial result is contested by the outcome of the second referendum.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister's covenants from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatening social unrest on the scale of the protests of "yellow vests" in France due to social inequality and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a "settling mood" during a tumultuous argument about the language of politics, but emphasized that he would not stop using the word "giving up."
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times": "There have never been protests in this country such as demonstrations of "gilets jaunes" ("yellow vests") or riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – guilets jaunes – they use encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate pickets, and to push people to protest enough unfriendly populist leaders.
The Los Angeles riots broke out after a jury acquitted four white police officers who beat black cabbie Rodney King in 1992.
This year anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow retro-reflective vests – gilet jaunes – have been ravaged and devastated the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the House of Commons and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people will vote, and 66% of them will vote in favour of the UK remaining in the European Union, ten million citizens will remain unhappy," said the minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their MP and who will not give up.
Much does not need to be seen soon on the street several tens of thousands of people.
One of the main cabinet ministers added that the country is threatened with "violent social unrest" if the outcome of the first referendum is called into question by the outcome of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would settle the fate of the brexit.
According to reports, the Prime Minister is facing a risk of mutiny in the cabinet to lower demands for brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Hołównia, Czubówna and Krosny were delighted in Krakow.
We're behind Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants listened to 11 inspiring speakers on Thursday (September 26), including Simon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Broadening the horizons, discussing ideas worthy of publicity, and joint discussions that can be an impetus for further development.
This was the goal of the talk'N'Roll conference organizers, inviting 11 outstanding speakers to the stage, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among them people known from the media - Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The slogan of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and just around the creation of the future were the speeches of guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the managing director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told about how the brand, which is being built around him, can affect our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the audience's perception of the rejection phenomenon, claiming that it should be accepted if you want to create a future, and Chris Badura undertook the subject of empathy in an era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help in career management and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right balance between work and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, which spoke, among other things, about how the profession of a lecturer in Poland has changed over the years.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that – thanks to the development of technology – today anyone can work with this profession.
However, he does not think that in the next few years a man in the position of a speaker will be completely replaced by technology.
Right after it, Piotr Nabielec addressed the problem of living in times of informational, emotional or overdosage in the matter of choice, giving valuable guidance to the audience on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech spoke about what another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
♪ Playing, teaching, teaching fun ♪
The conference organizers also took care of the artistic impressions, inviting the magician, Daniel Onlyk, to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first entertained the audience with a pantonim and then – on the example of his own career – told how he tried to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and private life.
Szymon Hołownia also kidnapped the participants with his speech, emphasising the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes could radically change the situation, and you have to be ready to use that time.
In addition, the Holovnia shared its thoughts on the surrounding reality, recalling anecdotes that could have sparked a smile on viewers' faces.
Then Adrian Tworuszka appeared on the stage, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
In conclusion, Marcin Słowiak, on the example of Rubik's ankle, talked about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to the great commitment of the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all those who could not participate in the event personally, and recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, posing a threat to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the tripartition of power," he writes in a report published on Thursday by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.
The "Governments of Law Instead of Rule of Law" report documents, among other things, changes in the justice system and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled “Governments of Law Instead of Rule of Law.
Threats for the Protection of Human Rights in Poland in 2015–2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the biggest regression in the area of human rights protection in Poland was recorded after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, posing a threat to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of tripartition of power.
By adapting the right to political goals, the rule of law was replaced by the rule of law," writes the HFPC experts.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the judiciary, independent institutions (such as public media or the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"For the first time in the last four years and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to carry out particular party interests.
This translated into an ongoing crisis of the rule of law, and also to weaken the whole system of human rights protection in Poland", stressed attorney Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years have been "a period of systemic change both in the country" and "in the area of the protection of human rights".
Over the last four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 legal acts that are crucial for the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often adopted in a hurry, without public consultation and despite the reservations of the legal community, the Ombudsman or international organisations," explained lawyer Małgorzata Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years are: "weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), disregarding the binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening the guarantees of the protection of human rights".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs found "these situations in which the authorities did not react or directly ignored the occurrence of aggression".
Foundation experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the State's activity in limiting the rule of law is due to ongoing dispute between Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law entities.
"The failure to implement these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as the leader of democratic transformations in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to responsibility for violation of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights", the report states.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life imprisonment for honor killing
Women's rights experts say that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail and the blurring of matters in public awareness.
"It's been so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, the women's rights defender and founder of the first gender faculty in Pakistan at the university, and adds that even the widely publicized Baloch murder case has been settled for over three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to determine according to women's rights groups, the Pakistani Human Rights Committee in 2018 identified at least 300 cases of so-called honorary killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and a network promoting awareness of crimes from honorary motives estimates that Pakistan reaches about one fifth of the 5,000 honorary killings committed each year worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the messages to the country are decreasing because many emigrants stay outside Poland permanently – says Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
According to the latest Euro-Tax report, the average earnings of Poles working in other countries of Europe amounted to over PLN 8.6 thousand in 2018, which means that it increased by almost a thousand zlotys, which is almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish economic migrants in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year ago", we read.
Director of the Centre for Migration Research at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better at the international labour market, where they use various options available.
"There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who are moving from country to country in search of ever better conditions, as are employees of international corporations," says the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, e.g. the UK and Germany.
"It is in Germany in 2018 that the total earnings of Polish expatriates increased by 11 percent (to nearly PLN 27 billion).
However, Poles made the most money in the Islands – almost PLN 35 billion", we read further.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic migrants does not decrease.
The saxons in the West and the North of Europe (leading Norway) are often a chance for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
"And even at the minimum rates in a given country, which in Germany, for example, amounts to EUR 9.5-11.7 per hour", the journal reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" states that Poles remain not only because of higher earnings, but also because they settled abroad.
Many Poles grow roots abroad, which is also seen from decreasing remittances to the country.
These last year were the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Chrzyscicki reminds, as the period of stay abroad is extended, a group of people transferring money to the country is decreasing and their amount is decreasing.
"Emigrants bring their loved ones together," we read in Friday's "Rzeczpospolita".
Prolonged monsoons cause flooding and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended by almost a month, and unusual rainfall causes death due to buildings slipping and many crops rotting.
Usually in northern India, monsoon subsides at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the norm by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon for decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unusual – recently in Pune, a western India, Wednesday and Thursday heavy rains have resulted in several deaths and desolations due to the collapse of buildings.
Houses were flooded, people were walking through the streets in the water to the knees, which normally occurs only during the monsoon apogee.
There was also a lot of rainfall in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of prolonged rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many homes were destroyed.
Monsoon also started late.
There was a lack of water in many areas, so farmers were preparing for a possible drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
"My vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of a delayed and late-ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, an essential component of Indian food.
Onion, for which you usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pound British), now costs 80 rupees (about 1 pound British) per kilo in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival is Dasara's 8 October festival, during which Hindus erect huge puppets like from a comic book, depicting Ravana, a figure with a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the epic "Ramajana".
The burning of Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's likenesses are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, it is Ravana who will laugh last.

Doodle celebrates Google's 21st birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we look for answers to all the questions that bother us.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are some of the favourite categories searched by Poles.
According to the giant's data, last year we were happy to ask, among others, "Where is the storm?", "How to make asparagus?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How to get rid of fruit fly?", "How to eat kaki?".
Today the search engine celebrates its twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and in Poland as many as 96 percent of people use "Google uncle" – are greeted today by a special Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthday, showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner printed a digital date – as in the photo from the 1990s.
Synchronising folder
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Its name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning the number ten raised to the hundredth power.
This name was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as many pages as possible from the world's Internet resources.
The Google search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the methods of simple segregation of results based on the frequency of occurrence of a given phrase.
At first, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linked to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon afterwards launched the famous google.com website today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" reports an extremely accurate Google search results.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, conquering subsequent markets and increasing the value of the company.
As early as June 2000, Google's URL index has more than a billion positions, making Page and Brin's work the largest web search engine in the world.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So, is there any more field for development?
"The mission of Google is to organize global information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made great progress in this area, we still have a very long way to go to achieve this goal," Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland assured in his interview with "Newsweek".
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that exposure to highly concentrated plant protection products may translate into a high risk of heart ailments in later years of life.
This was the case for a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, who had been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment for exposure to pesticides at work and the importance of recording in the medical records of contact with such agents at work, as well as controlling standard factors increasing the incidence of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results were based on data on more than 6000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in Kuakini Honolulu's cardiology program.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as it concerned only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their health effects can become known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez stated: "After 34 years of observation of men, it turned out that the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant".
This was probably because more important factors related to aging were becoming, which masked possible causal relations between exposure to pesticides and circulatory diseases in later years of life.
Researchers have not discovered a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zełenski-Trump phone call: Poroshenko throws in his three cents
Washington politics are having a stormy week with the launch of an impeachment procedure against U.S. President Donald Trump
Involvement in the political scandal is a situation for the political debutant Volodymyr Zelenski, who he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first one?
Almost at the outset of Trump's phone conversation, he told Zelenski that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not full, they describe in detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader and other leaders of European countries engage in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy was caused by Zelenski's response, which stated that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 100%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decide to speak via social networking sites.
Petro Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, tweeted that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU's support given in the course of "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?".
Trump then mentioned military aid and asked Zelenski to investigate not one but two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son – Hunter – and the second relating to hacking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on Democrats' e-mail boxes during the 2016 election.
It is not known whether this will damage European relations or break relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who help us," he stated after the publication of Zełenski's telephone call in New York during the General Assembly of the United Nations.
Zelenski is scheduled to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the "Normandish Four" to be held in October.
Former Provincial Inspector Affiliated
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of his alleged actions.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of the charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Provincial Trade Quality Inspectorate of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, on the charge of exceeding the powers.
The Lublin D.A. accused him of betraying the term of control in a food oil plant to the then marshal of the province.
A final acquittal has recently been filed in this case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12.
"The court has maintained the acquittal judgment under appeal," confirms Judge Margaret Reizer, spokesman for the Industrial District Court.
It is a judgment of 14 February this year issued by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on him on Facebook: “It has been six years since the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin presented me with the alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of Podkarpackie Voivodeship on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and did not violate the applicable law at the time.
I was convinced that my phone conversation at the time with the Marshal of Podkarpackie Province was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of events which the media, drawn up in 2013 by the Lublin Appeals Prosecutor's Office, missed the truth and caused irreparable damage to both the food producer's entrepreneur and the loss of my image to my employers, to employees and to the local community.
The indictment that was made against me in the Opinion of the Court of First Instance contained a number of errors, false facts, unreliable terms of legal bases, unconfirmed events in reality.
With the help of the CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately discharged from my job and stripped of my financial resources.
I stayed for a long time to support my wife."
Let's recap.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the Provincial Inspector of the Quality of Agricultural and Food Products from 2009 to 2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin presented charges to him in 2013.
According to investigators, he was supposed to tell the then marshal of the voivodship (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the time limit of the inspection in the plant producing food oil belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of Podkarpackie.
This warning, as the prosecutors from Lublin claimed, was supposed to make the company's owner aware of the control and correct labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of breach of rights, which threatened him for up to 3 years in prison.
“I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now finally confirmed by a final judgment acquittaling me from the charges I was charged with," comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide the recording of the conversation with Zelenski
In a Thursday-released report, the whistleblower wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenski, was seeking foreign state interference in the US elections, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated August 12, the whistleblower, who is probably an intelligence worker, wrote: "As part of my official duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the President had used his function to demand foreign country interference in the 2020 elections in the United States."
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
More specifically, he tried to push the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president re-election in 2020," says the report, quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
The Ukrainian leader was "understanded" that his contacts with Trump depended on whether he "shows the will to play" in matters more specifically about which he was to be informed by President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but points out that he was informed in detail about its content by “many White House officials who had direct information about it” and their accounts overlapped.
"The following days after this conversation I learned from many U.S. officials that high-ranking White House representatives intervened to “seal” all archival records concerning this conversation, and especially the literal record that was drawn up, as usual, in the White House crisis room," we read further.
“High-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers “ordered them to” remove electronic records from the IT system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," wrote the report's author.
"In my opinion, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the signaler said.
As the AP agency comments, this document will probably speed up the investigation of a possible impeachment of the President, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The recording of the conversation with the Zelenski White House, after the pressures of Congress, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of electronic recording, but on the basis of the accounts of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in a edited version, was revealed the following day by the House of Representatives' intelligence committee.
Also on Thursday, acting director of American intelligence, Joseph Maguire testified before the House of Representatives' intelligence committee and provided explanations on the way he treated the intelligence worker's report.
Maguire said the signaler made the right choice and acted as required by the law.
He also stressed that in his opinion the matter of talking to Zelenski is an event "without precedent".
Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the signal report to Congress; the intelligence director replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, whose confidential nature was guaranteed by the so-called executive privilege.
Part of Maguire's hearing by the committee was behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi reported that due to suspicion that the President was exerting pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she assessed that Trump's record of his conversation with Zelenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken standards regarding elections and security.
U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts and press clippings glued together."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and false narrative promoted by mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the ongoing 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security prize was awarded in recognition of Ghana's highest number of aviation safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 percent on the temporary rate of effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM audit on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Security Agency's Universal Audit Programme.
The security award was evidence of recognition of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO's recommended security standards and protocols at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme was designed to provide support to an ICAO initiative called No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety and security certificates have been awarded to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and security standards and 17 in the field of security.
At the awards ceremony for Ghana was the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need for Member States to maintain safety in the air space.
He stated "it is important that we keep reminding ourselves that even in the age of innovation, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our primary priorities".
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the efforts of the state, as they were a compliment to the hard work and perseverance of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has great potential for the development of the country’s economy, saying “aircraft has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
They are socio-economic benefits, but they are all due to the security and security that we have achieved."
PROTECTION: He was tanking and running, and he stole a bike.
A 50-year-old from the municipality of Zamość was driving up his Audi under a distributor, refueling and leaving without paying.
That's how he robbed gas stations several times.
A month ago, a man also stole a bicycle from one of the foreign offices.
The owners of the gas stations valued losses at almost PLN 1,000.
Owner of a stolen bike – for PLN 2000.
Last Tuesday, one of the Zamość neighborhoods noticed an Audi on Wyszyński Street, the owner of which was suspected of stealing.
There was a 50-year-old man behind the wheel.
A man was detained in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard allegations of stealing fuel from four gas stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
Uniforms also found the stolen bike.
The unisignor will return to the owner soon.
The theft of a thief is punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting as administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when testifying at a meeting of the Senate Budgetary Subcommittee on National Security on the FEMA budget proposal for the 2020 financial year at the Capitol Hill in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday American President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, who is the deputy administrator of FEMA, acts as the head of the agency, who oversees a government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency operated without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March, when Brock Long released this post.
Long resigned after the United States Department of Homeland Security, under FEMA, stated that Long had improperly used government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this post, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier that month when a thorough examination of his past revealed allegations that he was in a bar fight.
Gaynor's appointment was expected for this post.
To approve his nomination for this role, a majority in the Senate will be required.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became a deputy FEMA administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in the state of Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, is considering a finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized at a distance of 1,500 metres, winning the 2012 gold medal of the European Championship (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also a runner-up to Europe at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the 2016 Olympics, but the pains returned and in this season became very severe.
The pain makes me put my foot differently, which in turn changes my body's layout, there are other unnatural loads and I start to feel pain in other places, like my hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for the world championship, and for two weeks the pain has been so severe that I have difficulty wearing spikes," said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
Gjert Ingebrigtsen's father and coach admitted that after lengthy discussions with their son, they had come to the conclusion that the only solution not to finish his career and participate in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only, although drastic solution and the decision has actually been made.
"If a part of the body hurts, you should get rid of it, and in total Henrik does not need that finger so much and in this situation you should forget about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close the illegal e-cigarette plant with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-cigarette plant with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
The office building at 9600 Telstar Avenue was raided at approximately 16:37 p.m., during which police sought illegal cannabis-containing e-cigarettes for sale and during which large jars of butane hashish oil – cannabis concentrate were found.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, officers also found a device that was used to supplement the vaping contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," Cano says.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The ordinary electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the ignition of these fumes, causing not only the fire, but because of the concentration, even the explosion," he says.
“If there are many jars and things in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could wipe out the entire complex.
A task force was called to the office building to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant so they could detect illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to find out who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person set up a business here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to make sure that illegal products have not hit the street, given recent articles on the harmfulness of vapping.
"People don't really know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This could be a threat to our community and to our children, which is why we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF decided to take a medicine for thrush
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate reported withdrawal from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat moulds and mouth yeast infections, Gram-positive infections.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to a non-compliance with the requirements of the product quality specification and a decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Each month, the GIF issues on average several decisions to withdraw individual product series from the market.
A series of medicinal products that have been discontinued in Poland can be re-introduced after the presentation of evidence of safety.
If the medicine is withdrawn, it is not possible.
19 zł banknote – where to buy a collectible banknote about this denomination?
It bears a face value of 19 zlotys and bears the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski on it.
In early October a new collector's banknote will be put into circulation – the National Bank of Poland reported.
It's another banknote from the Independence series.
It is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Polish Security Printing Works.
As described in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the banknote, January 25, 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the founding of PWPW falls.
Also nominal value, PLN 19, refers to the year of creation of the Factory" - we read in the NBP release.
The watermark shows the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
New is the holographic stripe placed on the window in the ground.
The front page presents a portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription "independent" a stylized image of the Order of the White Eagle was presented.
This inscription, reproduced from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is a logotype of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of regaining independence by Poland.
In the branch of Lorenzo, symbolizing fraternity and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angular effect, was incorporated.
On the reverse side of the banknote there is an image of the factory building against the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
Next to it is built into the PWPW logotype SPARK Live protection and the burn bar, also visible in UV light in the form of repeated numbers "19" and abbreviation "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is scheduled to enter circulation on October 2 with up to 55 thousand units.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by the NBP, including those from the special series, are legal tender in Poland.
However, their nominal value is much higher than that which can be achieved on the collector's market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, or over two million zlotys, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded onto the barge.
From there, he sailed 50 miles across the river.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
PiS President Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska in the upcoming election.
"I'm asking the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński together with Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for the photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" praised on social media that she would gain Kaczyński's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska", we read on her Facebook page.
The head of the party pointed out that he was a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to bring help.
"I will cast my vote on Margaret Gosiewska and ask the same thing," she calls.
Gosiewska is a candidate for the Sejm from the District of 19. (Warsaw) and from the third place on the list.
The "One" is Kaczyński himself, and the second place is Mariusz Kamiński.
The Christmas Book Fair is coming.
We have meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpacie are said to not read books.
We'll show that it's different," said Marta Heltorak during the press conference.
And who will support reading in Rzeszów this year?
As we heard, Sister Anastasia will appear at the fair, hailed as the first cook of the Republic, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn, a great cultural event will be held at Millennium Hall – on 22 and 23 November, the 3rd edition of the Book Fair will be held at the shopping centre.
The most interesting publishing and bookkeeping offices from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be as many as 30 of them, including Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book novelties, which participants of the fair will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, authors were invited to write about important matters and are not afraid to take on difficult topics, and are also winners of prestigious awards and... they cook great.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, Łukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the policy passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best-selling "Loneliness in the Network", and the queen of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bond herself, confirmed the participation in the fair.
The star of this year's fair will be Sister Anastasia, the author of several books (including cookbooks), which sold in over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the Lost Dress of Elizabeth I at Hampton Court Palace
The silver threaded dress made of the finest silk camlot was craftyly decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation exhibition, this meant only one thing.
The faded cloth that had been hanging for 100 years on the wall of the tiny rural parish church that she was looking at could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn accidentally stumbled upon an lavish altar cloth in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's missing dress is due to be held next month at Hampton Court Palace, close to the same premises where the Tudor dynasty queen could wear it more than 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dresses only one more element of the 16th-century dress survived.
Although there is no conclusive proof that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silver", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved exclusively for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bear, indicates that the dress belonged to the most outstanding of people.
The dress, at the time it was made, could have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, or at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt a threat on the part of other women outside and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fine fabrics," says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the community to look at the dress.
I was really happy to see the dress, and they were delighted with it, and they were practically convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long, renewed life of the dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark St Faith church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the closest to Elizabeth the lady of the manor who served the queen throughout her long life, and with which in local legends the said fabric was identified.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or parish in memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, of which four hundred have passed on the most delicate hand-made sewing using specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar cloth will enter the exhibition next to the portrait of "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous paintings depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress, rented at the time of the exhibition by Hatfield House Palace.
"While working with historical fabrics, the craftsmanship of the people who made them begins to be truly respected," said Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in a converted greenhouse in Hampton Court Palace, the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapestrys.
“Looking at the embroidery from the front and the back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition entitled "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will start on October 12 at Hampton Court Palace
The Fitch Agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
The Fitch Agency confirmed on Friday a long-term foreign currency rating of Poland at the level of "A-" – as stated in the communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"Fitch agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well diversified economy, which is supported by a sensible economic policy and a strong banking sector", says the Ministry of Finance's Communication.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the economic cycle, and between 2019 and 2021 the real growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the general government deficit to GDP will remain below the 3 per cent threshold between 2020 and 2021, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The debt ratio of the government and self-government sector to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent by agency, and in subsequent years it will be lower (on average 48.3 percent between 2020 and 2021)", we read.
Polish Rating
The autumn round of reviews of Poland's ratings on 11 October will end with S&P and Moody's.
Poland's rating in the Fitch agency's assessment remains the same as it was released in late March 2019.
At the time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the level of "A-" with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Moody's highest rating of Poland is "A2".
Rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects of all evaluations are stable.
What is a rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to assist investors in assessing the risk scale of their investment activities.
Rating is awarded to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit rating.
On the basis of this, decisions are made about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests who best not to give any credit at all, because there is a considerable risk that the money will not be recovered.
A lower rating involves a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on credit.
Any assessment must be justified and certified.
Rating can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the world market for rating services is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own evaluation system.
"The Fifth Confederation": First 1000 plus
The "Friday of the Confederacy", the main assumptions of the electoral programme, were presented on Friday in Koszalin by candidates to the Sejm from district 40 seeking a mandate from the KW list of the Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Koskolinska list to the Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the slogans of the "five of the Confederacy".
"First, the program 1000 plus for Poland, second, quick and fair courts, third, cultural voucher and educational voucher, fourth, national security, fifth, that is healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "Poles must finally start earning decently", which is why the Confederate wants to liquidate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the tax-free amount problem will solve itself".
"Poles need to be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all", said the list leader about the assumptions of the "1000 plus programme for Poland".
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadencka, from the second place of the list, referring to the program's slogan "healthy life", said that "food is increasingly poorer and to change this, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy also advocates the cessation of "stigmatisation of hemp".
Zadencka declared support to the Confederacy for "the development of buildings using natural resources".
She also advocated voluntary vaccinations on behalf of her group.
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
Another candidates to the Seym from the Kostaklin district stressed that the Confederacy was in favour of a "deep reform of the judiciary", which would include the judge's "day after day" examination of the case.
They also argued that education subsidies should go to schools without intermediation of local governments, i.e. without additional costs associated with the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also in favour of "a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the army's numbers.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gasify coal, we have large deposits of geothermal energy, we also need to consider returning to the idea of a nuclear power plant," said Piotr Karpiński, fifth on the electoral list.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind a third of the drugs in the U.S.
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported a morning drug chase.
Brian McKnight of the Drug Enforcement Office (DEA) showed in full light what was going on.
Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight stated "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago originated in Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord, Nemesio Cervantes, simply known as El Mencho.
"He is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for federal executive bodies in the United States," stated Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The award for El Mencho amounts to $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs placed in the jungle.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of the drugs reaching the US by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
A $10 million prize awaits El Mencho's head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created the violent cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.
He basically owns his own SWAT teams," added Donahue.
El Mencho unpunishedly protects his empire by using measures such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that you can't deal with them without protective equipment.
In a lab, a packet of cocaine is called a smuggler's brand.
For over a third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," stated Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue says there's a "big chance" that drugs come from the El Mencho organization.
Last year, over 67,000 Americans died of an overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed French president and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady," claims the French prosecutor.
The defendant assures us that he has documents compromising the president's couple.
He demanded from the head of state, among others, EUR 300 000 in the cookery.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police, claims to have received "exploded" documents from a person employed at the Elysée Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the president's couple, but that revealing them in their entirety could even compromise Macron's safety and the First Lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded EUR 300 000 – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macro's daughters from a previous marriage in this case.
According to the D.A.'s office, the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would give it to the media – but for now it is not known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the search at the 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was undergoing psychiatric examinations, but the doctors did not find any serious disorders in him.
PS4 game will be oldschool – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the soon-to-be debut game available exclusively on the PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, as part of a recent presentation by the State of Play, announced that The Last of Us sequel premiered in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new episode of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
More details were revealed in the days after the loud premiere of the gameplay episode The Last of Us 2.
And it seems that Sony and Naughty Dog go to old-school climates in many ways.
The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several plates.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a sensational interview given to The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel had grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The plot is ambitious and intricate in aspects where the one was not in," he said.
She had to be so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the widest game, it just happened.
"There will be moments when you think that you are going to end, but you will realize that this is only the beginning and that a completely new chapter is beginning," Druckmann continues.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggi of adult content (information provided by Gamestpot).
We will not spoil the surprise, but appearing in the game of easter eggi refer to the old-school works of Naughty Dog.
You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on February 21, 2020 exclusively on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the release of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony has recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place a pre-prime order for the sequel, Sony has stated that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelets and a 30-centimeter figure of this iconic character.
Run, jerk and fight - Sport
On Saturday, First League Stomil will take Podbeskid and he wants to win.
Stomil footballers from three lines are undefeated.
Piotr Zajączkowski's subjects scored seven points at that time, because they won against Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match a goalless draw in Suwałki fell.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 6 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to the Extraclass.
Stomil's closest rivals take fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskid on trips this season played six times and scored two wins, draws and defeats While Stomil feels very good at his facility – at the stadium at al. Piłsudski 69a the team of Piotr Zajączkowski won three times and lost once.
In total, in ten queues, the ossitarians collected 17 points and are at the forefront of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the game, nothing announced it.
"Every change takes time to produce results," explains Piotr Skiba.
“And finally, we got something, we believed in each other, and we can work under normal conditions.
We just focused on playing ball.
They are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff".
On Tuesday, Stomil footballers eliminated the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed overtime and a series of penalty kicks.
To the south of Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go, because coach Zajączkowski gave rest to these key players before Saturday's skirmish with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, Jakub Mosakowski played in Chorzów after injury, who finally scored his long-awaited goal.
"It's always fun to score a goal, and I hit a point where we can continue to play in the cup (Mosakowski leveled at 3:3 in the 119th minute - ed.).
My dad used to bite me a lot and laugh that I couldn't score a goal, and I always told him I'd shoot at a point when he wasn't expecting."
Now Mosakowski hopes to return to the basic lineup, especially because of yellow cards he cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
"That's why I work hard at training so I can play first lineup," Mosakowski says.
“In Chorzów, I did everything I could to present myself to the best of my ability.
However, whether I play or sit on the bench, I will support the team as much as you do.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in a match against Podbeskid.
Surely we have a difficult meeting ahead of us, in which victory will have to run, pluck and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who has also recently suffered injury, so whether he will perform, we will learn only on Saturday, especially as coach Zajączkowski traditionally tries to keep the staff secret until the end.
A man raped and murdered his niece
“You will never see the light of day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and vile that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated the location of the body's cover.
"How could someone do this to their own niece?" asked Dejay Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," he said to Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our lives will never be the same again," added a devastated woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted that he had kidnapped, sexually abused, and murdered a girl.
A man's attorney stated that his client was raised in a "imperfect family".
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to suffer punishment.
A man was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of seeking parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would hand over nearly $100 million of additional funds to the drought-stricken communities.
The scheme providing money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for allocating farm allowances will be simplified.
The aid package includes nearly $34 million for a support initiative for drought-stricken communities, so eligible farms can receive up to $3,000 in an emergency.
Each of the 13 local local areas under the drought-stricken communities aid scheme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure grants and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to over $7 billion allocated by the government to the drought fund.

Betrayals of the Chinese (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)
Documentary: In China, divorce rates have doubled in the last decade.
This was generally due to third parties.
More and more men maintain extramarital relationships, resulting in a particular industry developing in this country – professional slaying of mistresses, which are intended to save the marriages of cheating wives.
Let's go out loud, Ma-te-u!
Attempt to welcome Prime Minister in Piekary Śląski
A personal general test was carried out before the electoral meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekary Śląski.
"Dearly beloved, louder, louder, this way we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-u!", encouraged the leader.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic gerrey did not produce the desired result.
Electoral campaign in progress.
Politicians travel all over the country, convincing voters.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also runs an intensive campaign, which is a frequent guest in the region as the leader of the Silesian List of Law and Justice.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including a suitable setting.
This was also the case, or rather – it was supposed to be, in the Silesian Bakery.
We know – special guest should be especially greeted.
Prior to the meeting with the Prime Minister, the speaker decided to conduct a general test.
Like a dry leader, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a welcome to me, but to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, my dears!", he encouraged enthusiastically.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not fully caught up in the lead's hot words and reluctantly responded to "Ma-te-usz", but the recording of the enthusiastic conductor makes the network hot.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay's house on 9 July 2014, demanding the release of his wife, Melanie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, according to Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one member of the family survived, a 15-year-old Cassidy Stay at the time.
The authorities claimed she was badly injured, but she recovered completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.
The jury will reconvene on Monday to issue a conviction.
Quantum Internet Getting Closer to Reality – ScienceDaily
The U.S. Army research results are moving the quantum internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of maintenance not available with a traditional approach to networking.
The Center for the Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the Opportunities of the American Army watched researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state entangled between matter and light – over a distance of 50 kilometres using fiber optic cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as cubs.
When two cubs are tangled and one of them is measured, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the other cub is physically distant.
"These [50 km] are two rows of magnitude farther than possible before, and it is a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and a major researcher in the project, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, the Quantum Information section.
The intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of the physical networks of the cubites, which are intertwined despite a long physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dispersal of the entangled state is essential for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a big step forward in order to achieve a distributed state of confusion on a large scale," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-managing a military program supporting this research.
The quality of the state tangled at the other end after the fiber travel is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult quantum network applications.
The research team began the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, researchers entered the quantum state into the ion, at the same time generating it to emit photon, in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were tangled.
The challenge is to send photon to a fiber optic cable.
"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the fiber optic," Lanyon said.
Therefore, his team initially sent a particle of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The wavelength of the photon has been converted into an optimal value from the point of view of transmission to long distances – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometre fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and the particles of light were still entangled even after the wavelength had been transformed and the distance traveled.
"The decision to choose calcium means that this result sets a direct path for the creation of a tangled network of atomic clocks at long physical distances, as calcium can be co-imprisoned with a high-quality cup of "a clock".
The Army is very keenly interested in tangled clock networks built on a large scale due to applications concerning precise positioning, precise navigation and timing," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
