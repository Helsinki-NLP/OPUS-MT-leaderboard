Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
For his Masses to be released and healed, the crowds are drawn.
He was several years old when things began to happen in his life.
Today, through a Franciscan, others experience it.
The Masses for the release and healing of Fr Witko bring crowds
He was once approached by the parents of a seven-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was rushed to the hospital for surgery.
Astounded doctors said: "Operation is not needed, the decline is just 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying out of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s spiritual remarkable actions began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment," he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, couldn't get a voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
That's when God told him to save him.
"In the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to the human form..." he says.
He hasn't told anyone about these strange experiences.
His calling was ripe.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted to talk more than just about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease participate in Masses about healing celebrated by their father Witko.
But the clergyman emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not fleshly healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th this afternoon) Kolping's FRAC team deservedly submitted to its current Polish champion Dartom Bogori Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
Jarosławs in such a personal ranking as they presented with the grodziszczans have little chance of winning with the league's sovereigns.
He clearly showed this duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called team leader Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the lineup the Yaroslavians would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown up to win against such places as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, i.e. Marek Badowski.
The Hellada player was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski and Daniel Górak after an emotional five hundredth battle – Pavl Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
One could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han failed Badowski.
There won't be any more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive research for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group had been badly selected.
"These activities may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to increasing difficulties in access to NFZ benefits and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive test results", it says.
The department's decision is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we predicted the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then they'll go to a doctor later, which is absurd, because it's about making it happen that prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"It is hard for me to imagine that experts say, Let's not study, because there will be longer queues at the doctor's, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that this is the state of health care," added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all the agreements we have made.
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreement concluded with Israel if the future government of this country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will arise, begins to implement this plan, we will nullify all the signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he announced.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all of our rights with all possible means – not important what the consequences will be – by fully engaging in action for the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," stated the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, after the September 17 elections, was again given the mission of forming a government.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won them, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements, which the United States was patronizing.
84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold general elections on Palestinian soils.
The last one was held in 2006.
"When I return to the country I will call upon the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the solemnly Palestinian President.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to exercise the powers of "full-fledged members of the UN and of all its bodies and institutions."
The Palestinian leader concluded the speech with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations provisions with full respect".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "will focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership."
However, Danon, as noted by the agencies, did not refer to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
Paramedics want defibrillators at the critical points of Przemysl
History from the border crossing shows that an AED automatic defibrillator can save lives.
The Provincial Emergency Service in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in the city's sensitive points.
For their attitude, officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicator Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. Customs and Tax Service Officer noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died of torture in custody.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
To Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, the secretary of the Communist party from her native village called on September 23 to inform that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
At Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who didn't get close to Wang."
Police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband had been severely ill and died due to a "unhappy accident".
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost 105 million PLN of funding will be awarded to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of GameINN on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR was the development of a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine creating a real world map together with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test and training platform to verify practical skills at work and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0 – given in the NCBR release sent on Friday to PAP.
The objective of the GameINN Sector Programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game industry is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the already PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme provide an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev", reads the release.
The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs to invest in innovation, such as R & D reliefs, competence improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes carried out by the NCBR drive innovation activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market", says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R & D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
"The amount of the deducted costs related to R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave over PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN", emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
A huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of proposals submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"In particular, it welcomes the fact that the selected projects – as in previous editions – include projects on solutions for not only entertainment but also industry-related 4.0", he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time the competition was announced was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded nearly PLN 105 million of co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Operational Programme Smart Development.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to the theft of Kasper Dolberg's watch
The incident occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who in late August went from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any, it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the beginning.
Football players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is being monitored.
According to the AFP agency, Diaby-Fadig finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch to the Dane.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a thirteen-year-old to make his debut in the first band three years later.
This season, he made seven appearances.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the L'Equipe newspaper reported, the club is likely to resolve it with immediate effect.
For now, he has initiated disciplinary action against his fighter.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30–40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
Yet most of us wash them less!
All it takes is warm water and simple soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them against it).
By washing, we rub not only the bottoms and the tops of the hand, but also: finger tips (attached or individually) – rub them with circular motions on the inside of the second hand, the spaces between the fingers (strip your hands, rubbing your fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb we hold the other hand and in such a embrace we spin it a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you cannot wash your hands) we should wipe our hands with a wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the hand-washed handles or doors (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
Iran's president says he turned down the U.S. call, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not engage with the American side during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, despite the Americans' offer to abolish sanctions," stated Iran's President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he refused to do.
According to Iran's President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed the abolition of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for entering into negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.
Rowhani: Iran will not make talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to take these talks due to the "toxic atmosphere".
He stated that he had met with American diplomats because he had submitted to the teachings of France, Germany and Great Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US, and the European parties to the nuclear agreement had abandoned favouring American sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a prerequisite that does not allow" dialogue to be established.
If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the past week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the request of the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no," tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with an atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tensions between Washington and Tehran to save in some form the 2015 deal with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It stated that in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapons programme and that the nuclear sector would be subject to control by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, its remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
Nothing's worked out so far.
Washington uses the tactics of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if it did not receive a licence to export raw material, it would limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking of the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday for ruling by the NSA.
Reason: no disciplinary action has been initiated against him, so there is no reason to maintain the order of WSA president Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt in late August, but it has not so far turned into an investigation against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must address the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its issue.
In this situation, a judge who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who, due to suspicion of participation in a hate group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He claims there's no evidence other than the fake screens and the words of his wife he's divorcing.
That's exactly what the other judges associated with the caste say: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll be on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't lift a finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, he's also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which the phone stopped in June on another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of the people whom, as persecutors, Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out in a February report.
There is no evidence – there is no case of Szmydt, there is no case of "Kasta".
There is also no case of NIK chief Marian Banas about renting the tenement house to sutners and hiding income.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check when he does.
The Committee on the Ethics of the Members will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control somehow gathered to make a curiosity decision to dismiss Banasian's deputies and appoint his lawyer as p.o., although the law of such a bizarre combination does not foresee).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American novel, I think, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated that she can't utter a word.
She's standing in the door, she's speechless, and at the time, the lover jumps out of bed quickly, dresses and leaves.
And my husband made the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and yells, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
It's just that there's a parody of the state in the case of Cast or Banasia.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the jump finals up
Previously returning this season to compete after a maternity break, the 2017 bronze medalist of the 2017 London World Championships, in the first attempt defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1,94 it was only possible to obtain it in the third approach.
‘I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically", she admitted in front of the Eurosport Lićwinko camera.
In the eliminations, the best turned out to be American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik – after 1.94.
Both players were the only ones who did not knock down any height.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
The beginning at 19.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in heavy condition
He went to the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
It must be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will turn out that he will win again.
We are all praying that he will recover," said an anonymous close person of Kornel Morawiecki in a conversation with journalists of "Super Express".
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My closest family and politics keep me alive," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave journalists "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to research at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
"I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I'm jaundiced.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father handed it over.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major surgery at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki told, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The surgery lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't think I'm metastasized.
I don't know if I'm going through chemo yet.
I turn myself in to doctors of specialists who are rather optimistic.
For now, after this heavy surgery, I need to get back to some sort of utility state.
I hope everything will be all right," Kornel Morawiecki pointed out in January in a conversation with "SE".
"If I had been tested too late, it would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to that padola...", he added.

The last time she was seen, she was wearing a sweatshirt, gray pants and shoes.

The power of the ominous leaps.
The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon on 15 September on a hippodrome at Oleandra Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.
For to the true power the road is far away, but this is what one of the kinds of horse competition is called...
The competition for the power of jumps is to overcome more and more obstacles by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two metres.
It is worth adding that the long and still unbeaten record of the world, established in 1949, by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
This high in Oława, of course, no one jumped, but the score of the best local amazons of 135 cm also does not belong to the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists "In the saddle" were a show part of the "Red equestrian competitions" that were previously played on page 22 of this issue.
Eight amazons, training riding in Oławski JKS, entered the competition.
Four of them competed on the ponies, and four on the big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szłodra was best suited, riding the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but dynamic rumac began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with a top beam distanced from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three consecutive refusals he was removed by the jury from further competition.
The second place in the ponies' jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famas", and the third by Lena Borun on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles to the small mares "Carmen".
Even greater emotions were accompanied by starting amazons and spectators during the competition with participation of large horses.
The dangerous looking downs were passed by Paulina Szewczyk, who was on the "Declarations" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the "Airplane".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazons nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mares "Wineta" to the parker had a lot of problems with the riding her Weronika Łuczkiewicz.
It was either a coach's assist or another horse to a couple, followed by a little crazy "Winet".
After the obstacle was completed, Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a bit of scared spectators, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska was great on the parker, sitting on the beautifully presented "Whisky".
This dignified mare, coupled with an experienced amazon, behind the second approach in the final phase were the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at that point.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also ranked the same height on the "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on the "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on the "Aircraft".
To decorate the flora and after receiving material awards in the form of equestrian equipment, all these players left together, and at the end together with the amazons on the ponies in the bar of the Radecki march performed an impressive honor round, ending with it these interesting and exciting competitions.

Max Kolonko cuts off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters about right-wing views.
Prior to the election Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and KWW itself The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko could not even collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko tweeted that he had completed his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution by Max Kolonko.
"I will expect the above-mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask not to associate my person with the above mentioned entity," he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.
For now it is not known whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On 4 July, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who resides in the United States, reported the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, on which he comments on events in Poland and in the world.
“We have had enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur rule.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and rule for the sake of the Nation," Kolonko said.
The party's agenda included issues relating to the judiciary (should be elected in the general election), tax changes (alignment of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to NATO's eastern flank states, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the holding of arms, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-mandate constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered into talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions eventually happened.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro course will remain close to the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets", says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy support the stabilization of gold quotations at the current ceiling," the specialist says in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its feet in an environment in which a large majority of central banks mitigate policies.
"As long as the gold is properly valued – the euro quotations should remain close to the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months – the Polish bonds are not attractive in his opinion.
Much more favourable profitability than Polish paper offers emerging market bonds," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets in the company of UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the economic downturn in the world.
"The global slowdown may get worse, but there should not be a severe recession, but at most a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero", says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should underestimate global actions that may harm the lack of prospects for resolving the trade conflict on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be relatively least behaved," according to the latest letter to investors by UBS Chief Manager Wealth Management Marek Haefele.
"The shares in the euro area countries should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fear of slowing down," says the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bonds markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of the German 10-year-old even to a minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, the long-term viability of long-term, but only short-term, should no longer decline by mitigating the monetary policy of banks.
The largest field of foot reduction has the Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the horizon of the following years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is the USD 1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19% potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further cuts in Fed's feet, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"To maintain the power of the dollar in the long term may not allow deficits in the current and budgetary accounts," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehra is losing his weapon.
Confidential report from the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition – according to a confidential list drawn up in the Ministry of Defence of the West Germany.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group EditorialsNewnerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Secretary of State's Office in the MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 pieces of ammunition have so far been re-traceable.
Among the military equipment that remains still missing are six universal machine guns MG3, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
Also missing 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns.
Concerned about the situation was expressed by Vice-President of the Left Party, Martina Renner.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "terrifying".
All the more so, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that it was not clear from the list whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a heavy act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the Act governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations on leading German politicians with extreme right-wing and racist motives.
His "black list" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutors, included, among others, the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally into possession of four firearms, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and over 50 explosives.
Crying children on the plane.
How do we avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for those for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the aircraft.
If a given connection travels to a minor until the age of two, the "child icon" appears on a specific, reserved by parents or carers seat.
Thus, the person using the carrier’s services has the option of choosing a place away from the one occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.
As expected, the idea divided the netizens.
Some Twitter users indicate that travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be kids.
"We must learn to tolerate because soon we will need a map of sitting places for breathing mouths, drooling or drunks," wrote user G Sundar.
Another of the Internet users noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca counts the losses after the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook
Over 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
On Friday, according to the representative of the autonomous Balearic Government Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand holidaymakers who will not be able to take October leave in Majorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons claims, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Island during November-April, the losses to the local economy will be reduced.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already begun negotiations with international operators on the "entry into the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to estimates from the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca", over 1,000 people will lose their jobs due to the tourism crisis in Majorca in October.
About 800 are fired employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook at many Majorca hotels, the property owners demanded guests to pay an additional fee for the accommodation.
Several dozen tourists from Poland, among others, experienced this situation.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had stopped operating at least until the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy and its cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the Friday newspaper "Diario de Ibiza" indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which have collaborated with the Thomas Cook group, are not intended to close the facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this balearic island, a British bankrupt man co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are located in Majorca.
According to the Balearic Government data, Thomas Cook owes local tourist companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of the July-September 2019 contracts of approximately EUR 5 million.
Women's FIFA Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the head of
The women's representation of Poland ranks 29th in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, Miłosz Stępiński's team was ranked in the previous July ranking.
Weak team games.
What's it gonna be in October?
The leaders remained American women who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by the German women, and the third remained Dutch women.
Polish people are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start with an away match with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of opponents, it was postponed by one year.
In this situation, Poles will inaugurate their qualifications with a meeting with Spaniards on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, "White-Red" will play two social games – on 3 October on a trip with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, Polish rivals are representations of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the groups and the top three teams from the second places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barracks by three final passes to the European championship.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog crushed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air programme are slim, and coal furnaces will kick as if nothing had happened this winter," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
"So far, 82 000 applications have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme for co-financing of a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 000 decisions have been positive.
Accepted applications amount to over PLN 915 million in total", says "Rz", citing data from the spokesman of the Minister of the Environment.
According to the newspaper, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the hype-pronounced program are judged to be "moderate".
Local governments, as quoted by the "Rz", see the failure of "Clean Air" among others in too large bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic declaration, sending invoices by post, possible random implementation checks.
This would improve the operation," says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation less than 1% of the intended purpose of replacing 3 million mounding boilers was realized.
According to "Rz", although the programme budget is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, only PLN 1.4 billion is reserved", we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now the price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favourable price," added the Polish minister.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish air force is to power 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September Poland agreed to sell them to the U.S. Department of State.
The Communication stresses that the investment will support national security and the foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department's information, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department indicated that the contract would also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics support and programme support elements and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter manufactured by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine multi-purpose fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombings and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, F-35 fighters purchased Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with an ageing F-16.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also to consider the purchase of U.S. combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie's manufacturer has placed a series of sexually neutral dolls on the market.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer launched a series of sexually neutral dolls
Next to Barbie of different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced a gender-neutral doll to the sale.
The toys in the Creative World series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys with girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
The emphasis on gender characteristics was also abandoned – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a thin waist or, in the case of Ken, broad arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have imposed sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit the ambition of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
Barbie's doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high heels shoes, has in the past been criticised many times for promoting "unhealthy women's stereotypes", such as for example an unnatural proportion of the body.
The company reacted to criticism and has already introduced dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: Circle or Club Together may have several MPs
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the letter was launched by candidates for the SLD, Spring and Left-wing Sejm Together, running with the common logo "Left"), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by hope that the Left is not only right but also strong," he noted.
According to Zandberg, it follows that the left may have 60–80 MPs.
"This may mean that a circle or club together will have several MPs.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how this is going to happen," he said.
When asked if the Left would have a separate wheel, Zandberg replied: “We are set to be diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by Poles because we showed that, by different ways, we were able to agree on a common programme."
When asked if the largest beneficiary of the joint start was SLD leader Vladimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he thought the largest beneficiaries were centroleft and left-wing voters.
In turn to note that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that "the goal of the political party is to represent its constituents."
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to the Sejm he would vote for himself.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is varied and there are candidates and candidates in this offer, to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further," he said.
"I will tell you very honestly and clearly that if I were in district 44 of the senate, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district," stressed the politician.
"I don't think I'd be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate)", he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski the leader of the Polish Citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The facility was built by the Mouride fraternity, belonging to the Sufi mainstream of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, donated by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan (the Paths to Paradise) is derived from the poem by Sheik Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century fraternity founder, venerated by his followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with marble carrarian and has five minarets.
The highest one is 78 metres.
The mosque in the middle holds 15,000 believers, and the other one can stay on the outside esplanad.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gold-plated dome, giant chandeliers and hand-crafted decorations by workers from Morocco.
Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 believers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was funded by private donations.
In addition to land, the government has provided lighting, sanitation and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, it's us.
A streak of eight league games without a victory the Crown footballers will try to break in Friday's meeting with the runner-up of the Śląski Extraclass.
"Our problem is not to return, but to ourselves, we have to work on what we are playing," stressed Kieelczan Mirosław Smyła.
The Crown footballers last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first line, when they defeated a 1:0 bonus of the competitions of Raków Częstochowa on the way out.
Later, the Kielczań noted two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
"It gives me optimism that in the final seconds of the cup match footballers were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the last whistle did not result from a breakdown, only it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smila.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," added the coach.
In Friday's game in the Crown, there will certainly not be a pause for the excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, and there will also be no injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
The builder, on the other hand, is reporting in a cup match of several players eager to play.
"We have a headache, recently it seemed that he would be gone, and now he is," said Smily.
Crown defender Daniel Strangel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break streaks of eight league games in a row without victory, while in the extraclass anyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the field, but there will come a moment when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," said the footballer.
After nine queues of extraclass Crown with a score of five points it takes 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks second.
The Friday match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42 percent of the tree species making up the state of Europe is at risk", warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.
The list is headed by chestnuts and raspberries.
The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by experts who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid expansion of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
In terms of typical European stands, according to IUCN specialists 58 percent of species are at risk, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the operation of the stand, accelerated urbanisation, too intensive logging, and subsequent forest fires and changes in the European eco-stistem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, moss and lichens is also heavily threatened.
"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of species of European plants and create the risk of the extinction of important and undervalued varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them freedom to publish on loan, which will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PiS is pic".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken".
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than the Kaczyński party.
"Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than PiS supporters, a party who has defied the values preached, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the Chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic principles of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing that data will be taken away, but the direction for the future must be determined, because the Law and Justice Office deals solely with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurial".
Schetyna explains that there is a project in the program KO, among others, which will give the least earnable Poles more by 614 PLN per hand and more by earners – also several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for publishing.
Like he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid on the publishing opposition until the financial collapse of the country finally occurred," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview with "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Pride walks before the fall.
Kaczyński is as statesman as Banas is crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether he would seek to chair the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors of the Great
Six large condors were found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condoms have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten toxic carcasses.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adult.
"This is a major loss to the environment, as the Condor must reach 10–15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we're losing a protected species, a endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental protection organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life-forms, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun to grant the head of the state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's law firm – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
According to the newspaper, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignium officially called during the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain can hit the arms of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on the amendment of the Orders and Awards Act in order to restore it.
The journal says it is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of the state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost with one vote.
This time, the work is quick.
In early August, Senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would seek the opinion of the President's Chancellery.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition," wrote then presidential minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the case was continued by the senate committee and again devoted little time to the case.
"The President's Chancellery responded briefly: he is in favour of bringing it back," said committee chief Robert Mamątow of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He applied for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Al. Cieplinski and Al. Piłsudski.
Uniform activities are related, in effect, to recent complaints by the city authorities on drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive action in Rzeszów "Modern Crossroads".
The aim is to eliminate obstacles in traffic: to enter a junction without the possibility of descent, not to comply with traffic signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we are making life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, Vice President of the city a few days ago.
His words were delivered at a city hall press conference, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate traffic of cars at intersections, resulting in traffic jams.
At the time, the president appealed to travellers for reasonableness on the road and, among others, faster starting on lights or not writing text messages while driving.
The subject was taken over by the Soviet police officers, who are starting the "Modern Crossroads" action from now on.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of congestion at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to increasing traffic and traffic congestion.
It is threatened by a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late departure from the signals, slow crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will action be carried out?
M.a. on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Al. Piłsudski Street; Targowa Street from Piłsudski Street; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw Uprising.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacia will be carried out on the following Fridays of October.
They checked the waste disposal company from Chaika.
"Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Volominski County Old Town and the Regional Construction Supervision Inspectorate inspected the installation in the municipality of Zielonka on Friday, where waste from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is being disposed of", said the spokesman for the old-age of Volomina Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors from the old-age Volomina conducted a check at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The Private Commercial and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under the contract with the Capital Waste Treatment Plant "Cchajka" performs waste-sewage management services.
"The installation was inspected and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business," said Szyszko.
He added that the post-control report would be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw during the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and tests of groundwater, and did not have the results of the tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant "Cchajka".
After the audit of Dariusz Saturday was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Dariusz Saturday is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludges from the "Czajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste at the excavation site, waste of up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Waterworks and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUŚ was decommissioned, which was related to the damage to one of the appliances incinerators.
According to the MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walesa supported Margaret Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," said Lech Wałęsa to Margaret Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr President, these are very important words for me," replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition to the Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now "just a retired fan".
Margaret Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
The son of Wałęsa – Jarosław – also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You took on a difficult task," he said after Lech Wałęsa met.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, the great hope that as a woman you can cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible," said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is," she said.
“Let us show that we can do another, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
You did so with your revolution, and we want to change Poland this way", emphasized Kidawa-Błońska.
Retired fan
Wałęsa in an interview with journalists said that he is now "just a retired fan".
"Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The tripartition of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are needed.
And all this needs to be cleared, all this needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, we have a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
"That is why it is so important that Poles go to elections, think about it and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing," added Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that with a card we will improve the state of affairs as it is in Poland," the former president replied.
"We must build the foundation again"
When asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the three divisions of power do not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it a reality and so that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move forward."
ME volleyball players: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
On hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European championship.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The "White-Red" have lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment the Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important government officials and the flights of the most important persons in the state.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Act on the property of families of government officials – without amendments – and 14 were against, three abstained.
The Senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to "civilise" and limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adopted to cases where children remain in a common household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important public officials whose project was created at the Prime Minister's office was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The rules assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons who are at the head of other state institutions, will be required to include in their declaration the personal assets of spouses, children and persons who remain in common life.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the Act on flights of the most important persons in the state.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who may be on board government aircraft along with the most important persons in the state.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Flight Register.
The bill – without amendments – was favoured by 55 senators, 12 opposed, four abstained.
According to the Act, every flight of the President will be a flight "executed in an official mission".
On flights, the President will be able to accompany family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the official Prime Minister and Speakers of the Sejm and the Senate will only fly "to perform tasks directly related to the function."
The Act also specifies a list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to regulations, members of the delegation may be on board – invited MPs, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; technical, medical or organisational staff; as well as journalists.
In accordance with the Act, in the event of any doubts about the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their clarification.
If such doubts are not resolved within the prescribed time limit, the Head of the NRPM will be required to notify the Heads of the Sejm or the Senate of the failure to organise such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, Poles are waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in a bronze medal match on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's subjects on the way to winning the title closed Thursday's defeat with the Slovenes 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their problems with the trip to this duel.
This time there were no such problems – on Friday mornings they went with the Slovenes charter to Paris, and a few hours later they took training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the report of those present in the class, the trainer of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of volleyball elements.
"We went to the hall, but it was definitely the time for the band.
The point was to spend more time together than to train.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We have been brutally brought to earth.
No doubt we're disappointed.
We always believed we'd get back to that game.
We were discussing this match between the two of us at the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point to ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situation balls.
Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.
In his opinion, "White-Red" did not stand in the way of stress, associated with a performance against the popular and numerous audiences of co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions might have slightly put the smooth road to the semi-finals to sleep.
"Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group phase, we would have studied this lesson more quickly and would have played differently later in the tournament.
But it's just a guess," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday defeat of Poles will be able to turn into aggression in a bronze match.
“I hope that we will show our true face.
There's something to fight for.
Recently we won the ME medal in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group phase meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and in the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: punishment severe but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week start ban and a fine of $25,000 – in a six-month suspension – for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
A summary of the offences of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but however both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which the unruly athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been upsetting for a long time and has earned a specific tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and alongside him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting judge and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match against Karen Chachanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $133,000.
In the US Open 2019 he did not play long either, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the said verdict on suspension of launches and another fine.
However, the words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the guilty one and learning the context of the statement.
However, in their justification, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour for the entire past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence a high punishment.
ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering that several conditions be fulfilled in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of the professional tennis players in force, in particular, it can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the audience, nor any other manner of conduct indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments, and also outside the season he consulted people specialising in solving the problems of athletes who did not cope with proper behavior.
The first comment (on social media) by Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have a break of at least two weeks, as his shoulder injury became worse in the Lavera Cup, so he had to give up his upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13).
In the ATP ranking Kyrgios ranks 27th.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he made over $1.3 million, so even after the fines, he will have a lot left.
Central Statistical Office: Poland is living better and better
According to a report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday, 44 percent of them were assessed as good or rather good in their material situation.
The previous year, this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of households, it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 percent a year earlier and over 20% in 2009.
The material situation of self-employed households is best.
In this group, over 70 percent of respondents consider it good or rather good.
In the second pole there are pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18 percent.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.
Single parent parents are the worst, with 32 percent declaring a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households is 48.8%.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by single parents and multi-children (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects the rapid increase in income, especially from work.
However, that is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link at the level of the voivodships between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9 percent of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are further Lubuskie Voivodeships (47.7%), Silesian Provinces (47.6%), Mazowieckie Provinces (47.3%) and West Pomeranian Provinces (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubusek 98 percent.
The highest income was the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
On average in Poland, the disposable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after the adjustment for the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, that's a pretty low score.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187 in the last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7 percent.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased in real terms by 1.9 percent, and in 2016 by 4.3 percent.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while still in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week – reported the American Navy.
In the last two years, five crew members of this ship have been killed in total.
The previous suicide took place in July of that year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot each other last week.
Each event occurred on land when USS George H. W. Bush docked off the coast of Virginia State.
So far, third party participation in the case has been excluded.
In addition, death is not to be linked.
"We need everyone involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent further suicide.
I want to stress that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions associated with seeking help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander on Facebook.
Niesiołowski critically about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiolowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"Actually, every sentence he made was accepted".
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way still during the life of Pope Pole", he explained.
A former PO politician admitted: “There was a murmuring discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, similarly his successor", explained Niesiolowski.
“Besides, this terrible case of pedophilia and the Church’s actions, or, in fact, their absence, has come.
I ran a little forward, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recent times.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters," he says in an interview with journalist Niesiolowski.
In the opinion of the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice.
"It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, there were crosses everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they became a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay dearly," argued Niesiolowski.
"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and some others of this type," he concluded.
HRUBIES: Tomorrow celebrates the 590th anniversary of the county

The PZPN is throwing penalties at the stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The Polish Cup match between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk did not close by when the goalkeeper Zlatana Alomerovicia passed the goalkeeper by millimeter by the fans from Wejherów.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating the case gave Gryf a severe punishment, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup for the 2020/2021 season.
Additionally, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to leave the groups for league games until 31 December.
Burdy at Widzewa Łódź Stadium was also hailed by fans of Silesia Wrocław.
Here, however, the sentence of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events might occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Despite this, the services allowed the Łódź sector to be thrown down by race fans, to set fire to chairs and to push the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned organizing trips to matches in this and the next release of PP.
The ban also included the Extraclass league matches, but it will continue until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange labelling throughout the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the recording of the names of foreign cities on road signs also began in Polish.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship changes will be made on 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, more readable and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of the localities in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the change in law prepared by us, they will finally appear on the signposts on our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway", informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
On Podkarpacie changes will be made on 94 road signs set up on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200,000 PLN.
First, the new labelling will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
So what's the idea going to look like?
We'll be fine without changing the plates, just like stickers.
They will replace the existing names of the localities, written in Polish on the already existing characters.
Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish, then in the original, in brackets.
This will be a great facilitation for those who do not know the spelling of foreign cities in the language of the state in which they are located.

Someone shot the swans from the gun.
In the pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed swans having wings problems.
After catching and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had set a target from the animal – in his body a shotgun shot was found.
"He received information about the injured bird from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sola.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We're on our way.
It was obvious that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to put him under any additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray photo, it was known that someone made a firing shield out of it.
In his body there were shrapnels of sharps", says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol managing, among others, the rehabilitation centre.
He's going to winter at the resort.
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, water access was provided, a safe place in the resort where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
Letting him go now would involve that he probably wouldn't survive the winter," adds Walasek.
Personnel after undergoing the swan rehabilitation plan to release him in spring to the same pond.
The authorities of Żukowice Municipality, upon receipt of information on the cause of the animal's ill health, intend to inform the prosecution of the case.
The incident occurred in Zameczno
Gowin: “We must stimulate Polish, small trade”
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to be considered whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin during a conversation in "Signals of the Day" in Radio Jedynka stated that the trade is mastered by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Noting that this problem was very difficult to fight, Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the Law and Justice Government tried to face it at the very beginning of the term, but got a "contra on the part of the EC".
"We have won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and formulates the government, we will return to this topic," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade".
"On this point, it will have to be considered whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU Court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in considering that the Polish retail tax was not permitted public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income over PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply as of September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated an infringement procedure for EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
She then stated that the tribute had been put into effect in an illegal manner.
It also issued a suspension order for the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU Court opened the way for a reintroduced tax, but it did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal at the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the EUSEU informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
For now, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure will take place, namely hearing the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to the delivery of the judgment.
"Such a procedure lasts an average of a year," said PAP source at the Court in Luxembourg.
How do you dress a baby for baptism?
We offer some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity for the whole family around the child to celebrate his appearance in the world.
Little wonder, then, that a newly baked mother and father want their comfort to look as good as possible on that day.
But before you make a final decision about the baby’s outfit, consider whether it will be comfortable.
In the shops you can find many outfits that do not provide the little one with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptism dress is the age of the child
Until recently, a few weeks later, little ones were baptized, dressed in white sets and put in the same beiges or big pillows.
Today, children who join the sacrament are often older: a few months, a year or even bigger.
It is easy to know that such a great comfort needs a slightly different baptism dress.
So if your child is 3 to 4 months old on the day of his baptism, he is likely to be in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or godparents.
The best way to do this is to decorate it with comfortable cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this garment element is considered to be a everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, such as frills or lace.
For the boy, a body with a bow tie and a brace will be perfect.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look lovely in a simple, tulle dress
Many of the girls' parents look forward to the richly decorated, fabled dresses for baptism in a set with coats, armbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, breathless materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of suitable clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and charming sets will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys' parents had a fashion for suits that were a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or helmets often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their discontent.
Today, fortunately, they were pushed out by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, sweatpants, and a blouse decorated in the front with a vest pattern.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not hinder the movements of the world of the little one.
Krystyna Pavlowicz published a statement of property
Krystyna Pavlowicz made a statement of property at the end of her term of office.
It shows that the MP of PiS has accumulated 110 thousand PLN of savings.
Let us remind you that Pavlovich announced that she had resigned from politics.
At the end of the term of office, it has the amount of PLN 110 thousand
According to a statement made by the Member, she receives a monthly pension worth PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and slightly smaller, which he rents, collecting PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150 thousand.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a statement of property.
Voting on a break in the session during the Conservative Party conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons' deliberations in time for the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, as requested by the government.
289 Members voted in favour, against – 306.
The House of Commons does not normally sit at party conferences, so that Members do not have to give up either their participation in them or their parliamentary meetings.
However, opposition parties felt that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the meeting.
There were 289 Members in favour of the government's request for a break, and there were 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The refusal to allow a break may be perceived as a political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared by the Supreme Court to be illegal and unconscionable) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the ruling of the judges.
After this ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing stormy debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brexit and avoiding early election.
"The time has come for a brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on the priorities of citizens, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – Labour Party and Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave explaining such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders", writes foreign media.
The President's spokesman has definitely denied these reports.
"It's just not true," he tweeted Błażej Skuszalski.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", citing the "Jewish Insider", write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish Consulate in New York declared that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Poland, Poland."
‘Citat is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he tweeted Błażej Skuszalski.
He stressed that Duda "never said Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski, the portal "made it up".
According to the interviewers, "JI" during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, the decorated Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that Jews from Israel "such as Israel Kac" were responsible for an increase in anti-Semitism.
According to sources of the portal Boteach was to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who's Banas and what's his fault?
Rented by the tenement suites, the journalist led to the discovery of negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We're summing up another scandal that shook the ruling camp.
TVN's "Superwizjera" journalists have revealed that Marian Banaś, President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has in recent years failed to enter a 400-metre-long townhouse in a statement of property, which is located in Podgórz Kraków.
Moreover, his sub-rentee was to run sex business in the mentioned tenement (so rent rooms per hour).
In turn, the building itself has allegedly been a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
The irregularities were highlighted by Bertold Kittel in the program "Superwizjer".
The journalist revealed that from Banas the townhouse was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic encounters”.
The customers were to be men using prostitutes.
Banas answered the charges vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, rented by the tenement suites led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The tenement itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from her rental was to be understated.
"The estate of Marian Banasia and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia townhouse itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-corruption Office currently conducts audit of Marian Banasia's property statements for 2015–2019.
Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK until she was completed. "I will speak to your marshal for a free leave," he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
"We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or speed up the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.
That is why we are forced to perform the task of the state authorities and to report on the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said Mariusz Witczak, MP of PO-KO.
"If a normal Pole so grossly low-valued the rental of his property, he would already have 10 controls, tax increases and criminal-tax proceedings," he added.
He's gone high, he's gone low
Marian Banaś is the new president of the High Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was tabled by the Law and Justice and by the voices of the politicians of this party accepted.
Prior to that, Banas was associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005, acting in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.

Cooler Master launches a graphics card holder
Graphic cards can weigh a lot today, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been vain to look for on the store shelves a decade ago.
This is the solution – the handle for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – was presented by Cooler Master.
The new grip model for the graphics card is not only a functional solution allowing for a more reliable maintenance of the graphics card without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignore the command of a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a specific conduct order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of misconduct, threatened by fines, detentions, or restrictions on freedom.
The political unionists want to introduce such a change.
The idea went to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases go to Polish courts", we read.
The "Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition, which the Independent Union of Police is writing to Members on the amendment of the Code of Offences, has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offence.
It would read: "Whoever does not submit to the demand or order of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, is subject to imprisonment, fine or restriction of liberty."
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who fail to follow orders, prevent or impede the performance of their duties," the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita" that even though he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in matters of political manifestation.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations it would be unfavourable and instead of softening the situation, it would even exacerbate it," he adds.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively evaluated police interventions in 2018 and that every month the service takes 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important postwar Czech playwrights, today listed in one row with Václav Havel.
Jáchym, then, was the curse of the talent he was trying to use from the beginning.
After eight years, he returned with "A Sensitive Man".
The characters are Buras and Soňa along with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They're wandering actors, traveling across Europe.
He's a Shakespearean lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys had not made a sound since he was born, and for the other time stopped in infant times.
But it's not the heroes who are most important in this story.
They are all just backgrounds for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of fleaish province, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
"Susceptible Man" turns into an absurd theatre in some places.
Narration imitates didaskalia, and hero talks create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy
Although British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann functions.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT television, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with the office, which have been booked in Belgium, will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite being declared bankrupt by the British company's mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that the customers who bought the trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday on Monday.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was the breakdown on Sunday of talks of the last chance with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan already agreed on in August, the company would receive an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for German visitors Görlitz.
Actions are intended to help fight the growing decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost town of Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as the Guardian writes, the city faces considerable problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also faces a constant loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a decrease in the population of the city by 25 percent.
In 2013, it amounted to 54 000 people.
To fight the depopulation, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received.
Two thirds of them were made up of the inhabitants of large cities.
The programme was also interested in people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants in the project.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free housing units, and unemployment is three times higher than the average across the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to get the opinion of the participants in the programme.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – about what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild in charge of the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
