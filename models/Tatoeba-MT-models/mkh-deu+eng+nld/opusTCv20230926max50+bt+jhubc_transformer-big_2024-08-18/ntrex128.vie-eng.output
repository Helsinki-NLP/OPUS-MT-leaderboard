Welsh Parliamentarians (AM) worried about ‘looking like puppets’
There is a certain concern among some Members of Parliament regarding the change of their title to MWP (Parliamentary Assembly of Wales).
The issue was sparked by plans to change the name of the parliament to the Parliament of Wales.
Congressional deputies in the chamber were worried that this might be a problem that sparked mixed public opinion.
A Labour MP said his party was worried that "the phrase would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh native readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means fecal.
A Plaid Party delegate pointed out that the entire Party was "not proud" and suggested other names.
A Conservative Party delegate said his party had "no prejudice" about changing its name, but did not forget to mention how the MWP abbreviation can easily be turned into a Muppet.
The Welsh w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee is currently drafting a bill concerning the name change, stating: "The final decision on any identification of the Deputies will of course be of interest to the Deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 empowers the Welsh parliament to rename itself.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a referendum on proposals to seek a consensus basis for the naming of the Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
Considering the title story of the Members of Parliament, the Commission favors the Welsh Parliamentarian or WMP, but the results of the referendum show a bias towards the Welsh Parliamentarians.
Congressional deputies are openly offering other options, but efforts to reach consensus could be a concern for the Chief Election Officer, Elin Jones, who is tasked with submitting the draft amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft amendment would include other changes to the way parliament operates, including the rules for removing members of Congress from office and the design of the administration.
Members of Congress will issue a final vote on the question of what they should be changed for when they comment on the draft amendment.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters went to the polls on Sunday on whether they would change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
A full-scale vote was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition to the country's name change, has vowed to repeal the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the change of name was a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Bell of St. Martin's Church Falls Silently as the Crisis Occurs in Harlem
“Historically, the elders I’ve been exposed to have shared that every corner of the street has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there is no church and no bar.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said that today "Humans have many ways to communicate."
“Bars are no longer public lounges where people frequent them.”
As for the churches, he was concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and sooner or later it will all be back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with many of the town’s apartments, which would not help in preserving local sanctuaries.
“A fraction of the people who buy apartments in those condominiums will be white people, and then the prospect of closed churches will come faster than ever because there is no reason for the residents of those apartments to become lay people here.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis for people of color - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregations moved in the 1930s.
A congregation of black worshippers nearby took over the site.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black congregation under the management of Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or urging people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they set it up as a bell.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the ringing “the bell of the poor.”
The ringmaster in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an immutable historical treasure."
Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's would not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought up by lay leaders in the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The diocese’s governing body, which includes lay leaders, referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese “will seek to transfer the costs” to the diocese’s administration, although they are not involved in hiring the architects and contractors already mentioned.
Some parishioners are unhappy with the lack of transparency on the diocesan side.
Shark attacks 13-year-old lobster scuba diver in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while scuba diving for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp harvest, authorities said.
The incident occurred just before 7 a.m., near the coast of Beacon's in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and then they all came out and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a pleasurable scream when he caught the shrimp, but then he "realized that the boy was screaming: 'I was bitten!
You’ve been bitten!”
The whole part of the boy’s collarbone was exposed,” Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy’s side.
“I’m telling everyone to get out of the water right now: ‘There’s sharks there!’” he added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was insured, in critical condition.
The name of the shark as the perpetrator of the attack has not been determined.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that they spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to his upper body.
Officials closed the beach entrances from Ponto Sea in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's UK Beauty Market Entry Strategy
Sainsbury’s is pushing for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its traditional display-style beauty booths, which have expert helpers on hand.
As part of a massive push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods decline, larger beauty goods stores will be trialled in 11 stores nationwide and scaled up in more stores next year if there is any sign of goodwill.
The investment in beauty goods comes as supermarkets look for ways to take advantage of alternative stalls for TV stands, microwave ovens and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it doubled the size of its beauty products to 3,000 for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawaw.
Available brand chains such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space and sales areas that are similar to the way they are displayed in the store as they are at Boots.
The supermarket is also reinvigorating its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of products are purely plant-based, which is increasingly sought after by younger customers.
Fragrance Shop will test the discounts at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and turning to buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets must focus more on attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stalls will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to confront incentives from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and items.
Sainsbury’s, which has put Argos stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats stalls since they bought both brand chains two years ago, has boosted groceries sales and made the acquisition more lucrative.
The supermarket had previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical arrays but failed.
Sainsbury's tested the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split revenues from the stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceutical goods to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
Lloyds will play a part in the plan, by enhancing a range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of beauty lines to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will give direct advice.
Our range of brands are designed to suit every need and attractive environment as well as convenient locations means we are now an attractive stopover, challenging the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones gets angry after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "outraged" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their Truly interior and accessories brand.
The couple’s business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old host took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, which angered star Peter Jones as she pulled out of their ultra-profit-style branding business at the last minute - to focus on her own lucrative new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
During a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was "outraged" when the show's gold girl admitted that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK for one of her motels.
A source said: “For now, Truly is Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that could accompany her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, when it was very close to the premiere.
There’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to roll out.”
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions of dollars by investing heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and furniture, and the possibility of a delay in product launches.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin became close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones took a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
It’s a great fight, and we love each other deeply.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from media outlets for making a comment that some would consider "not to be in power" for seeing the North Korean leader in good faith.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said in a parody of “the host.”
“I have not given up anything.”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump praised it as a major step forward in denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “satisfactory response” from the United States to North Korea’s first arms removal moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We are in a good relationship now.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results - ending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of U.S. service members to their home countries.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing at the crowd in front of him.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia Destroys Island and Kills Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has gone missing, no declaration of a national disaster has been made, a precondition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very decisive in not asking for international aid, so it's very challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it remains uncertain whether foreign employees can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the continuing earthquake situation that Indonesia has experienced, the country has not been well prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places are not common in other locations.
Although the warning was effective, the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu could potentially lead to human damage.
At peak times, moving between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Disasters make logistics even more complicated.
An ambulance train was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims who were trying to reach Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s aging infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has squandered money on road and rail construction.
But a financial shortfall has plagued Joko’s administration as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions that have yet to end in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were washed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs scrambled on the streets, using machetes, bows and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge brings a draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea as his side were 1-0 ahead.
He handled the ball with his left foot before launching a shot at the long-distance pole.
The shot shot and headed to the high right corner of the goal.
The ball crossed the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew straight into the net.
"I'm simply in the right position, getting the ball and the players, including Shaq, are always trying to come up so I just need to go up," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante rushing so I handled a touch and shot without much hesitation.”
Chelsea lead nearly half of the match after the opening match of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this game, the Royal Cavalry striker passes the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the middle of the pitch and rushing onto Liverpool's side of the pitch.
Kovacic had a wall bounce from the middle of the field.
He had a beautiful slit, towards Hazard who was rushing up the no-go area.
Hazard eliminated the defence and finished with his left foot in the corner, overtaking Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Napoli in the Champions League group stage will take place at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3pm on Tuesday in London.
Damage to people due to the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and waves in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center reported early Sunday.
Many are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings brought by the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday, which followed waves as high as 20 feet high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the center, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is engulfed in the rubble of buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman to death
After the discovery of the body of a woman discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation has begun.
The 44-year-old victim was discovered at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, after which a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police urge locals if they see or hear anything to report it.
Investigator Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its initial stages but I urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, if you have seen or heard anything suspicious, to let us know.
I also urge anyone, especially the drivers, who inadvertently has saved anything from the cruise angles to contact us as they can obtain important information for our investigation.”
A police statement identified the woman as a local resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the home.
This afternoon, some people who were known to have had a relationship with the woman went to the scene to get testimony about where the victim was in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are in the process of notifying the victim’s relatives.
A Grayson Mews cab driver tried to return home, but police said no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn’t say anything when he found out about it.
Residents are told it will take several hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
An emotional woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s horrible.”
At two o'clock, outside the police cars in the blockade, there was another car outside.
Several police officers inside the blockade were monitoring the apartment.
Anyone with information please contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crime Prevention on 0800 555 111 24/7 from September 30.
Congressional statue of Cromwell becomes the latest monument to suffer the story of 'rewriting history'
The extermination would serve as a line of justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of his Puritan fanatics, who have destroyed countless British architectural and religious buildings.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's words as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The debate about leaving Oliver Cromwell’s statues outside Westminster Palace is inevitable.
Symbols of the British Civil War were not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell’s wrong will be taken over by the actions of Thomas’s father in the last century.
Cromwell’s representative, Sir William Hamo Thassycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of being honored.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps by the end of the 19th century there will be more than now, Cromwell is considered by many to be the protector of parliament against external pressure, in his mind of course the monarchy.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate example for the topic in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our country and Cromwell was a typical figure in division.
His achievements as the Guardian of the Lord are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Chinese Farmer Attacked by Pigs
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, known as "Yuan" was found dead with a broken artery, his whole body bleeding near a barn in a market in Lu Banshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Tayning, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly moved with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he had died, and saw a door in the pigsty next to the open barn.
He said there was a large boar in the cage with blood stains around the muzzle.
Reports of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs are bloody and not intact," his cousin, known as "Wu," told Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan arriving at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not the pig in the pigs of the two brothers.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market’s governing body are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though uncommon, cases of pigs attacking humans have been documented previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the smell of blood can serve as a “snake.”
“They just want to be close.
“They’re reserved, they’re curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right hugs,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rain across the U.S. Southwest
According to forecasts, Typhoon Rosa is weakening as it moves towards cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, a Category 1 Tropical Storm, as of 05:00 a.m. on East Sunday, and was identified 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical cyclone forms, it will begin to carry much of the north's humid heat into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring as much as 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the humidity encounters low pressure that will cause heavy rainfall to spread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, streams of debris and potentially landslides in the desert.
Humid temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at peaks, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in areas of the southwest, especially over large areas of Arizona.
Flash floods can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation will be extremely difficult if you venture into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become violent rivers and thunderstorms will bring localized gusts and dust storms.
Low pressure will bring some local heavy rain to the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, easily causing debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region’s first rainy season.
A number of scattered tropical rains began pouring into Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain became more common late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
It is possible to see some regions of extreme temperatures across the United States in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this results in significant changes in temperature in nearby localities.
A typical example of the significant temperature difference in the central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer warmth will be renewed and intensified.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is predicted to have a warm start in October with temperatures common in the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term weather forecasts are showing a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's hearing on six television networks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political stalemate continued, with television stations interrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute news on Friday: a deal put in place by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, Nielsen pointed out in the report on Friday.
The company counted average viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately included for other broadcasters including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has some issues when it comes to calculating who’s watching in the office.
As a reference, the number of spectators is similar to that of a final-ticket match or Oscars.
Fox News, whose host strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all broadcasters with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The concern remained great after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in the Friday noise.
After the moderate Republican just released a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was tracked by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was being shouted at by protesters as he tried to move under the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when questioned, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he told the truth to the whole country?”
He was accused of, "you have power while too many women are powerless."
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had issued a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television broadcasters covered hours of live coverage later, when the Judiciary Committee would have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would review the charges against the candidate next week, something some in the minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice carries weight, as it is clear that Republicans will not have Kavanaugh’s approval vote without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May dismisses 'political card game' criticism of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed criticism of her plans to leave the European Union as a "political gamble" on Britain's future and undermined national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, stressed his counter-attack on their so-called Chequers deal for Brexit, saying the UK and EU proposal to collect each other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who plays for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims fell out of his glasses during the clash.
Police found the glass from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the glass, according to CBS' WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Regional Office of Autopsies released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound from head to neck.
The department is relying on Louisiana State Police, the fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and residents of the area to assist in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU’s physical director Joe Alleva thanked regional law enforcement for their “skillfulness and pursuit of justice.”
Sims is only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-year-old striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 bats per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been "disrupted" and "stunned" by Wayde's death.
Mr Wade said: “That’s what you’re always going to have to be on your guard.”
Volcanic ash rushes into Mexico City
The ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has flowed to neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring many fluctuations and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash clouding car windshields in Mexico City’s neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators clashed with riot police, as thousands took part in protests marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's bipartisan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police with eggs and powder paint, causing clouds of black dust on the streets often crowded with tourists.
The fighting broke out at the end of the day when police used batons to suppress the fight.
For hours, the pro-independence faction chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" against protesters who protested, "Great Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region under independence ideology a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal for Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Independent voters were overwhelming, although the approval ratings were low with the majority anti-separatists boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop a vote taking place at polling stations in the region amid violent clashes.
Pro-independence activists camped through Friday night to prevent a rally in support of the national police.
The protest took place first but was forced to take place in a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had our happiest moments.
I watched my parents cry over being able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a narrowly important victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence factions have struggled to stay motivated this year with many of their most prominent leaders either separated or jailed awaiting trial for their role in holding a subsequent independence referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to the pro-police rally with her phone, said the conflict had been smothered by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before his trial since late last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Joining as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the fall in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crash
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Investigative police Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.

Menga's shot gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's lead helps Livingston secure victory
Livingston is up to surprise Rangers when the Ibrox home team is led by Steven Gerrard with just two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s scoring match proved the difference as Gary Holt’s side advanced to the Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard’s side have yet to score in the Premier League this season and face the Hearts lead, who are eight points ahead, on Sunday.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his unbeaten run in six games, as head coach Holt has also tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the chance to play against the underdogs.
Holt’s team should have been ahead of them before they scored, with their front-to-back tactics making Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson struggled but overcame the goal, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts more strongly after leading the ball to Craig Halkett on the goal.
The hosts are confident to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can make trouble for the visitors with their individual techniques.
And that's the strategy for a fixed score.
Rangers made a free-kick and Livingston took the lead, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up with Menga, who scored a touchdown and scored right in the middle of the goal.
At the moment, the Rangers have prevailed to keep the ball but find the defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly almost without difficulty,
The match continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow moved on to another Livingston play scenario.
The dribbles continued into Livingston's goal and were repeatedly caught, with two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to his replacement Glenn Middleton, one for the touch of the ball - being successfully thwarted.
'Label' with Livingston - analysis
from Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A good result and match for Livingston.
The team is excellent, continuing to reach far beyond expectations in the backstroke.
Their playing style and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top, but significant credit has to be given to Holt because of the way he has honed the team since his appearance.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett was the overarcher, arranging a wonderfully organized line of defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the sidelines.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Just as they did under Gerrard, they didn’t meet those standards.
The last shot was flawed – the only chance to open the home side – and it was a wake-up call for Rangers, who landed in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received many accolades in Cologne.
There were smiles and favorable weather on Saturday as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at mending ties between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the inauguration of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters – many of them Kurds – also spoke out, denouncing both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-polar protests reflect the split of a guest hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Deptford Accident: Cyclist Killed in Car Crash
A cyclist dies in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, a busy neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a car crash and fled on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were transferred and participants were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded in Riot
Six employees were injured in a riot in a prison for male inmates with strict security, the prison officer said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
"Tornado" experts were sent to deal with the chaos, which ended at around 17:30.
Officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
A spokesperson for the Prison Management Board said: “Specialized training camp personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured personnel were treated.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may spend longer behind bars.”
HM Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious insurrection in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a passing flood.
It’s rare for tropical depressions to strike Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen as early as next week when the energy trails of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern desert remain, entailing flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service released flash flood tracking on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa was expected to travel in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there had been thunderstorms.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned in a briefing that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed a tropical cyclone or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a 40-mile storm that made landfall on the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the latest National Hurricane Center predict precipitation is about 2 to 4 inches high, with segregated flood levels of up to 6 inches at Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest Desert, including the central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to be submerged by 1 to 2 inches, with separate flooding levels up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not suddenly flooded, the rain from Hurricane Rosa may be a good omen because the region is in drought.
Although flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls can still be welcomed because the Southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the lowest extreme drought, but still the second highest in the same category.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s route passes through a landslide across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in a typhoon range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and traveling north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit cooler currents in the Pacific Ocean and weakened.
As a result, forecasts suggest there will be landslides in Mexico when the tropical depression passes on Monday evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be significant, signaling no small chance of flooding.
According to Weather.com, “The estimated total rainfall ranges from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches.”
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday in the form of a tropical depression, which will then sweep through Arizona and make landfall in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main predicted danger from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening waterfalls in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspected Murderers Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace at Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
You were taken to the hospital in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have urged everyone if they can keep any footage related to the incident to go to the press.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered with Selfishness, Anger' by Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democrats’ ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh confronted Congress on Thursday, strongly and vehemently denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's excellence and character and courage" that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm that one of the most eminent legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a genuine public record,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
There are only five weeks until one of the most important elections in life.
I'm not running but I'm running." He shared.
“That’s why I go around fighting for bright candidates.”
Trump said Democrats want to “restrict and obstruct.”
The first core procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed as a result of earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, damage continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed away as huge waves hit beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves as high as six metres (18 feet) hit the shore at dusk, sweeping many dead and wreaking havoc on everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still participating in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) told reporters in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, it was dragging cars, timber, houses, sweeping through everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through open waters at 800 kph (497 mph) before making landfall.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque submerged in water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Technology Assessment and Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may not have stopped as they were along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media was "completely paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This has been a tragedy, but the tragedy can become much more horrific,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for failing to announce that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an unprofessional video posted on social media, it is possible to hear a man standing on high screaming panicked at those on the road about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water overflowed the shore, sweeping buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that caused a fault in communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun cutting off cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still desperately in need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to more than 800.
Very bad situation.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were staying in tarpaulins set up in the office yard, they went through devastating scenes on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a bad situation.
Even as aid groups began to make significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that highly specialized foreign aid workers were prevented from moving to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ then we can be ready with international support but there is no word yet.”
As Monday night falls on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will magically piece together the murky stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with the body of her mother beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paraglider team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Brother Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliding community, he was desperately texting WhatsApp to rivals in Palu, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicated that there was one gray product instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages were not sent,” he said.
The robbers took away $26,750 when the ATM was recharged at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink banker as they were recharging money into an ATM at Newport in Levee.
The driver of the car cleared the ATM in the recreation area and was about to hand over more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
While he was busy, a man "came in from behind the Brink employee" and took away the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to reports, witnesses saw multiple suspects loitering around the scene, but police have not identified the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspect involved please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he said, "Everyone knew I was Kanye West."
West, 41, has been using the stage name Ye for some time and uses the name as the eighth album released in June.
The change came before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release a new album Yandhi.
He was a guest on the show on behalf of singer Ariana Grande when she reported her “emotional disorder,” the show’s creator said.
As well as the acronym in his current stage name, West had previously said the word had religious implications for him.
“I believe that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, while chatting about the title of his album with broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The transition from Kanye, which means unique, to Ye – the reflection of the good, the bad, the troubled, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was aiming for Love and Brother Love.
An artist who has worked with West, Jay-Z, is also wondering whether or not there are dashes and capital letters.
Mexican president says he will not send troops against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of its bloody revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “never send the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
The military opened fire during a peace rally in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to learners and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said the problem of unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities has led young people to become involved in evils.
The United States should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in the field, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even while the U.S. overall is lacking a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to become a leading country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a positive start, as all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chance that the next giant AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Superpower Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat Othello players in the United States with the highest ranking, after which he was chief executive officer at Microsoft Research and director of Google’s China branch.
Lee approached previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Projects Research Agency’s Robot Challenge and cared about when the next competition would take place, in order to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often struggle to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is calling on all scholars to take the lead; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States bolster its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically issued to PhDs in AI.”
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: “China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to those in academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation and other government institutions subsidize U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at interfering with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the creation of the Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
This month the Agency for the Steering of Advanced Defense Research Projects announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they currently invest more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen any action in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece aimed at preventing accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, asserts that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has vetoed its participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents of nationalism argued that the change would undermine the national identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had raised questions about whether voters would meet a minimum of 50 percent of the requirements for the eligibility of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to pay to pursue membership in institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje, said: “Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it leads to a safer life for all of us.”
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the voting results to make a decision.
The name change would require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of anomalies until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in last year’s parliamentary election when 66 per cent of voters registered to vote.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, of the capital Skopje, said: "I go to the polls for my children, because we are in Europe."
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union's accession to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small podium and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by people who will boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the main road, not the back road.”
“We are a poor country, but poor for cleanliness.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move on to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian alliance.”
Zaev said NATO membership would bring urgent investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
“I believe the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He shared that a “yes” result would be “an affirmation for our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies said about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum – well below the mandatory vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they gave a yes vote.
A successful referendum must have a vote rate of 50 percent and a vote.
The referendum’s defeat represents the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City pierced the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed Brighton’s defence with Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed his level with a score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker receives a pass from the middle of the field at the start of the ball.
He chased up in front of three Brighton defenders before bursting into the open ground.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue players.
He chased up a defender before thwarting other opponents at the edge of Brighton’s goal.
Pass to the left, directing the ball to Sterling.
The Englishman led his first touchdown in the penalty area for Aguero, who lashed his right shoe with a shot to take down Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from the right of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has suffered some leg injuries."
“We talked about letting him play for 55 or 60 minutes.
It happened.
We were lucky that he had scored that point.”
But it is Sterling who gives the first advantage to the Blues players in the Premier League.”
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the lead deep into Brighton's side during the match.
He sent a top goal to the left field to Leroy Sane.

The Blue Jacket striker put the ball into the net just before the ball slipped out of control.
The match between City and Hoffenheim in the Champions League took place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to burn out against the Rockies
With the Nationals being eliminated from the final round of ticket competition, there isn’t much reason to start over.
But a belligerent Scherzer hopes to win the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when it comes to the Rockies, who lead a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the top spot.
"While it's pointless to play, at least we get to throw the ball when we learn about the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams that will play whatever form the highest I can play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to fight in a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce the starter in Sunday's game, but it looks like Scherzer will be playing in this situation.
Scherzer, who launched his 34th starter, will have a pitching practice session on Thursday and play on his Sunday break.
Washington's right-hand man scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 attacks in 220 two-thirds of matches this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president mentioned the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, choosing Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
There are only five weeks until one of the most important elections in life.
It’s one of the big, big things — not running but running is why I go around fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re going to see a negative, negative, radical Democratic Party that exists right now.
And they are determined to suppress power by using any trick, and then you will see selfishness, trickery.
They don’t care who gets hurt, who steps on who gets power and control, they just want power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
He added, “Democrats are looking for ‘limitation and obstruction.’
"You've seen that in the last four days," he added, arguing that Democrats are "angry and selfish and tricky and fake."
He pointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s assessment of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with boos from below.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the information?
What?
No, oh no, I expect — it’s a kind of incompetent body language — it’s the worst kind of body language I’ve ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Making an opinion is unacceptable.
I was not surprised that the activists of Momentum, in my local party, voted to censor me.
After all, I was the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be informed that I was not welcome – for raising my opinion.
As a member of Congress with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was adamant in her support of antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship move was aimed at me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a sizable economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the same ironic issues that Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labor Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years as a member of the local Labour Party, Friday evening leadership meetings were held in such a fashion.
Sadly, today, it’s not the tone in many meetings and the promise of “kinder, gentler” politics has long been forgotten and indeed whether that ever began.”
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged in terms of whether or not the party’s leaders approve.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as my former colleagues I thought that the same political views as I had started to expect me to shift my mind and take on positions I would never approve of – whether on national security or only on the EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and indeed no matter what I say – there are abuses on social media that call for removal, the central political denunciation, telling me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who sees it that way.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face the influx of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is the level of abuse that has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cherish a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that open party and with every “non-confidence” move or change in the rules of choice, the party has become shrinking.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the last two years about urging me to stay calm, not to say too many words, and then I’ll be “okay.”
But I’m not in politics for that reason.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was just a boy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my comprehensive school to collapse, I have sought to provide better public services to those who need them most – whether as local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be wrong about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who pushed the move on Friday, all I want to share is that as the country swamps itself in Brexit, which will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But really, a message outside Nottingham Momentum that I stand by, to my constituents, whether or not I am a Labour Party member: I am proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of elimination or any political means preventing me from acting for what I believe is in the best interest of my relatives.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Ayr unbeaten lead
The following two attempts may have skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the coveted Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only king in ten teams.
After all, it’s also their super defensive line, as well as much as a better chance for them, as the home team and coach Peter Murchie are absolutely right to be satisfied.
He said: “So far, we’ve been through our games and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m happy.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Assigned to Ayr, they take chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a lead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show off his skills and Jason Baggot to take a shot to the goal.
Climo rose to the top of Ayr with a penalty, before, in the first half, he scored an extra point with a solo to lift the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second half in a good way and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot scoring extra points, shortening the score to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had fallen behind, and since rebooting, Ayr had the upper hand thanks to Stafford McDowall's strike, Climo scored extra points.
Acting captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then suffered a yellow card, and again, Melrose cost the side player with a non-scoring extra score by Bruce Colvine, in the face of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow carded against Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored on the Ayr team's support advantage.
Climo scored more points, as he had done almost since his return, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's toss and passed to winger Gregor Henry after his fifth home goal.
Still Game star set to enter restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he is seen as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC series, which he wrote and starred in Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last on the radio, and it looks like Kiernan is planning for Craiglang’s next life.
According to the official list listed, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the matter, but a source from Scottish Sun said Kiernan was looking forward to entering the "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The coast is ours': Bolivian landlocked nation hopes court will reopen road to Pacific
Sailors patrol an armed naval headquarters in La Paz.
All public buildings have a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: "The sea is our right.
The sea is our mission.”
Every corner of Bolivia’s land, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century remains alive – as well as the desire to sail out to the Pacific once again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on Oct. 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expects in a positive view of the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will back Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of tense exchanges – Chile is obliged to negotiate giving Bolivia a sovereign sea passage.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincingly genuine president, who faces a fierce debate for re-election next year — also has more cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted: “We’re going back to the Pacific.”
But some analysts say the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia — and this is less likely to change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to hand over territory to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling comes just six months after the final debates showed the situation was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And beyond that, Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years, could be reversed.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said: “The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian authorities.”
She added that Morales’ belligerent statements had extinguished Chile’s remaining goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era with relations with Chile” and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual interest disagreements.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — was using maritime affairs as a political lifeline.
Bolivia: “Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific.”
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to step through the past.”
North Korea says it will never have a nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho revealed that his country would never disarm unless it could trust Washington before.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made the remarks as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be preparing to restart nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "vague dream" to continue the sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang taking noteworthy disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump look forward to a second summit.
But there is little doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that it could see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion launches the latest line of wide-brimmed hats that are about to cover all the major streets near you
If you want to loosen up your hat collection or stay completely out of the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of unusually large top team designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that will stun the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
Unapproachable hats swept Instagram this summer, and the designers brought their eye-catching creations to the runway.
Valentino’s standout item is a beige hat over the top of a wide-brimmed head attached to feather-like accessories, covering the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include a watermelon, a witch’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are stitched with lips that resemble Hannibal Lecter’s rather than high-end fashion.
One is like a scuba diving device complete with a snorkel and goggles, another looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep catching on to the giant fashion – then you’re in luck.
Tomb experts predict that large bezel hats may be about to cover all the major streets near you.
The giant hats became hot on the heels of the ‘La Bomba’ shoe, a few inches wide-brimmed sunglasses worn by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fan-favorite label behind the extremely impractical hat that pops up across social media has brought yet another big creation to the runway – a beach bag nearly as big as a bathing suit.
The burning orange raffia bag, bordered with raffia yarn with a white leather handle on top, is a highlight in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large beach hats and bags flooding the big streets next summer – as the designer has made such a tremendous impact that it’s hard to ignore the need for mega-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland still maintain their academic excellence, which was continued in 2018 with a rewarding series of academic results, reinforced both individually and collectively in terms of sport, art, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), are working to deliver the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to equip students with deep and broad knowledge, as well as career orientation and status as global citizens.
As an educational subdiscipline that can design and run the school’s distinctive curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continuing to be a popular and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in the language he understands, what he says comes to his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, the words will come to his mind.”
This is a compelling message that we don’t just rely on English for our desire to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading in the rankings with the best grades in private school subjects.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than A.
Data collected from SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored more than an A in Chinese, along with 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French and 63 percent learned Spanish as well.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are moving in the direction of treating foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will not be able to avoid in the future.
Elective foreign language subjects are being considered as STEM majors (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Council for Skills and Careers in 2014 found that among the reasons employers have difficulty finding people is due to a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills are becoming more and more practical in order to equip young people for professional practice in the future.
With more and more career prospects in need of a foreign language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose the job, if they learn a second language, they will get a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the language of the natives themselves, a multilingual person will obviously lead every challenge.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them are unable to practice a simple passage in another foreign language, and only French is the only foreign language that accounts for a single number of units, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in foreign language teaching is so important for children today.
Having multilingual hands, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with brighter potential to find a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to the UK in their vision for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests children, there are a variety of foreign languages to choose from within private schools, along with a team of teachers with expertise in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with skills essential to success, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be extremely important to the future of the nation, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to Scottish youth: diverse and outstanding.
There can be no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private School Board.
LeBron made his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play the first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how long he will be in the match is not yet determined.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website: "It will be in less than 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said there was a possibility that James would be in the game for a limited time.
Following up on the week's training, James was asked about plans for a six-game pre-season schedule at the Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play a few pre-season warm-ups at this stage of my career anymore.
President Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins his campaign.
It is the first leg of Trump’s five-man campaign journey next week, including stops in pro-states like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote for his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court is on hold, with President Trump trying to gain support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the vote begins in November.
What time does Trump’s campaign in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch President Trump’s campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearing by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is currently facing sexual assault charges and the Senate confirmation vote has to be postponed for a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of the rallies was to enlist support for Republican candidates ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the campaign goal through next week’s five rallies is to “strengthen volunteers and Republican supporters in the race to protect and expand the majority of votes they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is an important issue on the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw Pittsburgh's media coverage," West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in the past month to West Virginia, the state he won a 40 percent margin in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia State Senator, who is currently behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, said: “The fact that the president has to visit the state to enlist support in the candidate’s vote is not a good sign for Morrisey.”
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team demonstrates determination to keep the cup in singles matches on Sunday
After three unbalanced matches, Saturday afternoon doubles could be essential for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum-style wrist swing to create momentum is an entirely new sporting concept, but also a movement that athletes really believe in, especially in games like this one.
So where is the current momentum?
"They were six points ahead, flying four, and I think that's what motivates us," Spieth said as he walked away.
Of course, the European team has the advantage, four points ahead, and they have 12 more games left.
As Spieth says, the U.S. team still has some hope and they are very encouraged, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have played many times and each one has won three points.
Spieth is a veteran golfer in playing the ball from the shot to the hole and he always leads as an example.
The shouts of joy grew louder and louder when he came to his rounds, especially the brush to equalize the match as he and Thomas played the ball into the hole in turn.
The 15th-day win was the same, which meant that he had full confidence in the U.S. team’s comeback.
Spieth said: “You have to think hard and worry about your own game.
All the athletes have left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
For the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup, have been the only pair to score higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This quirky but respectable pair of the European team has won 4:0 and can not make mistakes.
“Moliwood” is the only pair that doesn’t hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoids bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the following nine holes on Friday mornings.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the cheering crowd gave people the feeling that the two of them were the opponents they needed to beat on Sunday; and there was no golfer more worthy than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at sunset on Le Golf National.
Hopefully, both of you will appear in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to confirm the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball series in the morning, as they played against Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles at the first nine holes completely lost the chance to counterattack.
On Sunday, no one was able to pull them out of that defeat.
Fourball and foursome matches are always worth the most because of the interaction between the duo, their advice, and the observation that the strategy of play changes in an instant.
The European team played better team-mates and took a long lead before the final day, but this foursome series showed that the US team still had a chance to win.
European team lead 10-6 before the start of the Ryder Cup final day
The European team will take advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup after a spectacular fourball and foursome series, ahead of the U.S. team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage by winning two Tiger Woods games to win four more points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, determined to win back the trophy to lose to his friends at Hazeltine two years ago, overwhelmingly won the U.S. in the morning fourball game, 3-1 ahead.
The U.S. team performed better in the foursome series, winning two, but failing to win the final.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in Sunday’s singles series to win back the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, often referred to as the "Molliwood" pair, were the second pair after the dramatic weekend that won four points in four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball match, they had an even more convincing victory over Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two matches on Saturday and sometimes had flashes of light, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games in a series of fourballs and foursomes, including seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball series, returned with Henrik Stenson in a foursome, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked 1st and 3rd in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, despite the pleasant weather southwest of Paris, the European team did not have an easy day.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won convincingly 2&1 against Spanish players Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball, and then went on to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team that is four points ahead can start singles matches, though Furyk team can only hold the cup.
After being considered only second in two days, Sunday will most likely become an upside-down for this team.
North Korea says ‘there’s no way’ to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister, speaking to the United Nations on Saturday, said the sanctions were being maintained and deepened its mistrust of the United States and, in this situation, there was no way for it to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, said North Korea had taken "many goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test bases and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a similar move from the U.S. side," he said.
“If we can’t trust the American side, we won’t be confident in our national security, and under such a situation, there’s no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri echoed North Korea’s familiar complaint that Washington rejects denuclearization “in stages” and that North Korea will receive the corresponding benefit of taking steps, his remarks this time have the notable point of not rejecting a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has previously refused.
Ri mentioned a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In this statement, Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula," while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes calls for easing harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'de-nuclear disarmament first' and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, even opposing the 'declaration of an end to the war'," Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a wild dream of people who don’t understand us.
But the problem here is that these sustained sanctions continue to lose our trust.”
Ri made no mention of plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the foreign minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the negotiating side on the nuclear disarmament issue is South Korea, not the United States, then the denuclearization talks on the Korean peninsula will not be in the current standoff.”
Ri’s tone, however, was different from last year’s, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s missile launch on the U.S. mainland was inevitable on a suicide mission after Trump called Kim a “missile man.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but this year praised Kim for bravely taking steps to disarm, but Trump also stressed that much more needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t set a deadline for this: “Two years, three years or just five months doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, however, that “Security Council sanctions must continue to be enforced in a robust and uncompromising manner until we can confirm the complete denuclearization result, ultimately, with verifiable evidence.”
The Security Council has agreed to step up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo held talks with Ri on the sidelines of official meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the outcome of the final visit was not very positive.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said talks had made some progress, but only hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making "black society-like demands."
North Korea has pledged to join a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile testing base and a nuclear complex if the United States makes a “similar move.”
He said Chairman Kim directed that the “similar move” he was seeking was the security guarantee that Trump had pledged during the talks in Singapore and moved toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on full rest
In an effort to combat machine-pressure learning culture, with 'night owl students' drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Women’s Hospital and Brigham designed the course, and he himself believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration started this course after he took a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
“After the end of the talk, a female student came up to me and said, ‘Why do you not know this until the last year?’
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains to students how the importance of good sleep habits improves academic and athletic performance and improves their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding students with severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course covers a wide range of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a dorm room image in which students can click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn about how caffeine, light, and sleep deprivation affect sports performance, as well as the importance of forming a punctual bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were asked to learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then the university campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” Czeisler added.
The culture of proud “night owl students” still exists, he said, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation is an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, good sleep quality should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of hunger, leading us to constantly be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who is studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Czeisler design the course, and he took one of the classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to make an effort to organize a course throughout the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to take a similar program of study before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider when setting bedtime alarms, waking hours, and being aware of the harmful effects of the ‘green light’ emitted by electronic displays and LEDs, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day when Dolly Menga's counter-attack caused Steven Gerrard's side to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox’s home side hoped to mark their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt’s side caused Gerrard’s second loss in 18 games as head coach, stretching an eight-point gap against the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts lead.
Menga maintained his attacking position seven minutes before the end of the first half, but the Rangers' temperament seemed to have never been crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed to 3rd place, behind only Hibernian in goal difference.
And Rangers also had to deal with another problem after marginal referee Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard changed the squad eight times over the squad that overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept Livi 11 drawn and won a point against the Hearts team last week and he must have been delighted with the way his students besieged the opponent in each attack.
Although Rangers hold more balls, Livingston is the team that is really dangerous with the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first pitched Scott Pittman, attacking Allan McGregor’s goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to the feet of captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow could only bring the ball to the post behind the goal.
Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their play is more based on hope than belief, especially in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should be given a penalty on the penalty spot because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian’s appeal.
Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was arguably advantageous, no one can deny that their win was entirely deserved.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs’s deep edge throw.
Scott Arfield failed to respond when Declan Gallagher poked Scott Robinson, and Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately took the option during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replacing him almost immediately made an impact when the winger poked the ball for Morelos but Kelly made an impression by immediately blocking the direction of the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in getting the visitors to play the way they wanted, as Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly launched long passes.
Holt's side had a chance to take the lead in the final minutes of the game, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow's wide head from the corner.
The Rangers newcomer Glenn Middleton went on to appeal for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but was again rejected by referee Thomson.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Excerpted from a page from the “Sunday Morning” Yearbook: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the foundation for a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become a pillar of science, but also a pillar of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the film "Bells of Coronado", which premiered in 1950, starring the cowboy-scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, the sentence can actually hear the effects of the radioactive atoms in the mineral.”
Evans: "Yes, there's a buzz here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name remains with time.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System How to ‘Observe’ Broken Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System How to ‘Observe’ Broken Cells and Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This method involves taking immune cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab.
These cells can then ‘see’ the protein that is common in many cancers and are injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is showing positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine teaches her immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, after which the cell is injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.
HER2 “promotes the development of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
A similar method of research, taking immune cells from the patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye receives many "stone tiles" for expressing frenzied support for President Trump, wearing the MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after Saturday Live Music Night (SNL)
It's not going well.
Kanye West received many boos in the studio during SNL Music Night, following his rambling performance. During the performance, he praised US President Donald Trump and confirmed he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he angrily expressed his opposition to Democrats and affirmed his support for President Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to my white friends and they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon. In the skit, the Hollywood star ironically took the oath of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sexual Assault Allegations by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not aired, the footage of West's angry speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock deliberately ridiculed West for posting this.
West also complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable behind the wings because of his hat.
“They bully me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go to the show with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they said I was bogged down," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you know what it's like to be bogged down?" He said, "I'm going to put on my hero's iconic hat, because nobody can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move on?
Be loving."
Variety reported that his speech made the crowd boo at least twice, while SNL members were confused, with one saying: “The whole studio was silent.”
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West left many confused with the performance of I Love It, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner. He once tweeted: "To donate one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU because you said something about the public."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “acting on his nature, and this is really cool.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying music or costumes, or by supporting his ‘art’) because I believe that person is pursuing and spreading ideologies that are not good for my community.
He has freedom.
We do too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He wasn’t the first artist to change his name, but only followed Diddy’s path, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; the late music legend Prince, changed his name to an icon and later, changed his name to Prince.

Star Game of Thrones Angry Criticism of Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor was quite angry with the hero’s archetype and mentioned that such male characters on screen would make young men feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "there's something wrong here" and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Newly married Kit co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31. He admits he feels "pretty necessary" to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with so-called masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men as adults about the issues that are ahead of us?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity caused by the extremely masculine characters they build.
He went on: ‘What characteristics are innate and what traits are due to education?
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to be men’s stereotypes?
I think this is really the dilemma of this era – how are we going to change?
Because obviously there was something wrong with our young boys.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any further prequels or spin-offs about Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, and stated that he was "bored of the battlefield and the horse".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s remake of True West that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop playing Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, which is where my future family and my life starts from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of the character Jon Snow that Kit played in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018, on the grounds of the Leslie family’s mansion in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids has increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of new cases recorded was 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a major change from the previous one.
Previously, the rapid spread of HIV in some parts of China was due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV following this path has dropped to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem that is occurring in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, it is still common practice to discriminate against the LGBT community.
Due to the country’s conservative traditional values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men end up still getting married, despite having sex with men.
Many people become infected with the disease by not using adequate protection when having sex with the same sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV medicines to all infected patients to cope with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaking Republican senators' data, stressing 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia about lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles insisted the complaints were settled by “extremely right-wing” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and lies are even more despicable,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, the leak included the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began appearing online on Thursday, due to an unidentified person at Capitol Hill Capitol Building during a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against the nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifies the origin of the posts related to Waters’s office and discloses information about one of Waters’ employees.
Waters continued, “This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and is an absolute lie.”
“The staff in my office has been compromised by identity, personal information and safety as a result of these false and false allegations that it is impossible for anyone to disclose such information.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and is absolutely a lie.”
Waters' statement immediately drew criticism online, including the White House's former press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial statement expresses anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that is not theirs, one should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not questioned about the motives of the accuser.
They have to show calmness and calmness.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's response to Democratic criticism and his critics also accused him of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Ms Waters claimed that her office had warned "the authorities and law enforcement of these false allegations.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are brought to light,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all actions that could be harmful and dangerous to any of my employees.”
Johnny English is back in the ring – Rowan Atkinson’s comically useless spy
Now, it is possible to notice a rather traditional trend in any new film whose British element is the search for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the series of spy-action comedy Johnny English is no exception. The series began premiering in 2003, as Johnny English and the second season as Johnny English - Re-released, released in 2011.
Will the self-sacrifice of how useless we are become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English’s limited powers with his rounded eyes and flexible facial muscles are allowed to shuffle things up again – his name simply represents a comic book designed for non-English-speaking areas.
Of course he’s a secret agent, though he always pretends to duck oddly in Inspector Clouseau’s style, mixing Mr. Bean’s humor and a little bit contributing to the Chariots of Fire theme melody at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character’s archetype is also based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard television commercial that has now sunk into oblivion and caused chaos upon awakening.
There are quite a few interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and propellers banging on his hat.
Although Atkinson’s humor is fully expressed, the humor here may not seem heavy enough and a bit redundant, especially when "serious" movie franchises like the 007 series and Mission Impossible have made comedy just a spice.
The humour in this movie can only make a child laugh, and I personally think Johnny English’s blunders are not as creative and remarkable as the jokes in Atkinson’s silent film Mr. Bean.
The situation leading the story is that England is in serious trouble.
Hackers have infiltrated the ultra-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British spies operating outside, leading to the dismay of a spy on duty, a very unfortunate minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the prime minister’s last chance, a proud and powerful figure, who is now facing this radical political crisis: Emma Thompson has performed very well as this version of Prime Minister Teresa May, but according to the scenario she doesn’t have much land to play.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identities of all active agents had been exposed and that she would have to mobilize a retired spy.
And that person is clumsy Johnny English, who is currently teaching in a rural area, but is in fact giving lessons outside the program to become a secret agent: there are some pretty interesting jokes here, because English teaches students to be spies in the style of the Rock Institute.
English was recalled to Whitehall Court for an emergency meeting and reunited with poor former aide Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, asking for a ride with a glamorous luxury submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on the role of a little wasted talent.
So the Batman and Robin duo troubleshoot the Queen's Order to return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of being cursed by the glamorous tech billionaire after claiming he can solve all of Britain’s computer headaches: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough set off on an adventure of unimaginable antics: after disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant in a flash; caused chaos on Volta's luxury yacht; and English made even more of a mess when it sought to use virtual reality headsets to probe Volta's home.
At the end of the movie, the knots will definitely be removed, but such excitement is quite similar to the TV channels for children.
It's a pretty ordinary piece of work.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but ask: Can’t you really give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s fair and worthy of your talent?
Labour denies plans to allow Britons to work four days but receive five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party will consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but receive five days a week.
According to the information received, the party wants business owners to transfer their savings from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This means that employees are given a three-day weekend break but still receive the same salary as before.
Sources said the idea was "consistent" with the party's economic agenda and expected to increase support for the country's workers.
The British Trade Unions Congress confirmed the move to work four days a week as a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “The process of reviewing policies is expected to be announced later this year.
“This goal cannot be achieved in the short term, but working four days a week is an aspiration consistent with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse the idea. The UK’s Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The policy of working four days a week is not the policy of the party and the party is not currently considering it."
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to strengthen his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the “unknown directors” and “utilities” at utility companies.
These shadow prime minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not be able to get back their entire shares because the Labour government may apply ‘deductions’ based on behavior deemed wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company’s board of directors and set up a Comprehensive Ownership Fund to award 10% of private company equity to company employees, from which they are able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh led them to change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him to the Supreme Court justice position for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Federal Intelligence Service’s findings could lead any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, “60 Minutes” reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found any evidence that might have caused the senators to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his counterpart from South Carolina.
“I think of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said during the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, i.e. after the allegation was made and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He answered very resolutely, decisively and decisively.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to have been absolutely certain.
He said: “I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there’s only one powerful charge that will change me.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all of the people she names can’t verify the story.
36 years have passed.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and does it contribute to the eradication of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive ensemble of stars to carry out an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
On the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Reduction Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To get free admission to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), music night attendees must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has this Global Citizenship Festival been, given that there are only 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free music night for everyone a practical way to convince people to call to action, or is it just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel they’re making a real difference by signing a petition online or submitting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens Organization says there have been more than 10 million recorded “actions” from supporters, pushing for a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped motivate leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set out to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far, secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and implementers, which is committed to "helping children to their fullest potential," promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens group.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can turn the social injustice that leads to malnutrition into a hallmark of history,” Nutrition Strength Program Ambassador Tracey Ullman told an audience during a live show in London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project called Nutrition Strength, which ensures nutrition intervention for 5 million women and children.
Answer to one of the FAQs on the group’s website “What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?”
The group responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just like previous civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will be performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to Blockade Russia's Energy Exports - Interior Minister
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilize naval forces “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia’s involvement in Syria – more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government – was just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe the reason they have entered the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy like in Eastern Europe, in the southern lowlands of Europe.”
And according to official news, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
“The U.S. has the ability to use its naval force to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and will close, when necessary, to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he said.
Zinke has urged attendees to attend the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that self-described as the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two were equally effective.
“The economic option that Iran and Russia can choose is to leverage and change the type of fuel,” he said, while calling Russia a “single strength” with an economy that relies solely on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration is seeking to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, aiming to replace Russia’s position, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil project that, according to Trump, has given Moscow “full control” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project, built to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s stiff opposition to the project stems simply from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers must be selected suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a big problem when a third country tries to interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to “Seriously Consider” 2020 Presidential Election, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterms.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
The Hill quoted her as saying, “It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix the government’s flaws, and so need a woman at the top.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump at a town hall meeting and said he was "putting the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course the FBI must investigate before voting."
But a poll on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's voters did not think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters "probably" said senators should not run.
32% supported her in the election.
The poll found that more voters supported former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting and 48 percent opposed.
Other potential Democratic candidates named for the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision before January.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin’s Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) syndrome at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can totally relate to other families who also suffer the consequences of PTSD and the trauma that our soldiers carry on their return,” she told a crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "a clear issue that no one wants to talk about" and said her son and other veterans returning from the war "have changed, are more thorny, and wonder if there's respect for them and their comrades, the Air Force and every other member of the military for what they've done for this country."
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman with domestic violence, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk.
18 states and D.C. support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are advocating to challenge the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a short collective text Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers protesting the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August to protest federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
She said her lover “and the sons of his violent gang members” abused her but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors for the pro-Grace states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of people apply for asylum in the U.S. as countries faced widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy goes against the 2014 Immigration Appeals Council decision to allow undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legal systems."
“Federal law requires consideration of all asylum applications based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claimant and this impediment policy violates that principle,” the brief text states.
Prosecutors also argued in the short text that the policy of immigration denial harmed the U.S. economy, because immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide adequate labour resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked judges to process immigration applications to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse in June.
“Only allow asylum for people who leave their country because of repression or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political views,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum is never a means of mitigating all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
“It’s really stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she patted her feverish son at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
People return to their destroyed homes, pick up their belongings in the water, trying to salvage whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, after damage from the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, broke his back and shoulder outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patient was treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
His tears flowed as he recalled the sensation of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the rubble of the wall," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and calling for help, but then I didn’t hear anything.
I don't know what happened to my wife.
I hope they are all safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily mentioning the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using U.S. journalism for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an additional sum by China Daily to Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is seeking to interfere in the U.S. election marks a new phase in a campaign to increase pressure on China by Washington in what U.S. officials shared with Reuters.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on their imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariff policy in retaliation in the early stages of the trade war has been designed to target exporters in Trump’s Republican-backed states such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, the state that exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying that China “is continuing that bullying behavior by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“To try to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you rarely find dissenting views and will not see any genuine reflection on the different opinions of the Chinese people about China’s difficult economic trajectory, because it is clear that the media is completely under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has shied away from the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh's case
As many top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Justice over several sexual assault allegations, analysts warned they could face backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion surrounding the incident was strong, and most of the Republican candidates on the campaign trail indicated they wanted to keep voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had pressed the button to allow the FBI to conduct enough investigations to appease angry voters.
Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow they will not forget and in November they will not forget.”
Mic reported: On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched through the Senate corridors as Republicans taking control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“The enthusiasm and drive for democracy will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“It is said that this momentum is already very high; yes.
But it could be even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly took an oath on the details of sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said the public would likely have a backlash if Republicans continued the confirmation.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as saying last week: “This could be a mess that the Republican Party has to deal with.”
“It’s not just a committee vote or a formal vote, or whether Kavanaugh will become a Supreme Court Justice, but more important than how Republicans handle this and how they treat the accuser,” Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA, a support group for the Democratic Party, told the news channel.
However, Americans disagree about whether to trust the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, and many seem more suspicious of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents affirmed or could trust Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they were or could trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents think Kavanaugh may or may not have lied when giving testimony, while only 30% think Ford is certain or may have lied.
After Flake pressed the approval button, the FBI was investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford was sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing his genitals in front of her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start building a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup project that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project is called Inrupt, a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and what permissions people are granted to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to "dominate the world."
“We have to start now,” he said of the startup.
"Now is the time of history."
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
This data repository can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all are available on one browser and display simultaneously.
What’s unique about this online store of personal data is that the user has full authority to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “transferring control of data to individuals.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to make sure the company is equipped with the right resources, processes, and skills to help deliver Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, several developers who have signed contracts to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether or not to change completely because all of their business models are fully upgradeable overnight.
“We don’t need to ask permission from them.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over net neutrality.
Despite the launch of the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Celebrating the day that Rabbi Bernard Vann received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Church of England's only clergyman to be awarded the Queen of Victoria's Cross during World War I as a warrior was held in his home country.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of sniper fire four days later and he never knew he had won the highest honour of the British Army.
On Saturday, two of his nephews unveiled a commemorative stone during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a brilliant symbol" when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then plunged straight into the firing range and with "excellent courage" led the battalion forward, before plunging into a rifleman and taking down three commandos.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "an action that I myself would never have done, but there was humility."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the Royal Brentwood Youth Band parade led.
Vann said he was "deeply honored to be part of the parade" and that "the bravery of a true hero will be recognized by the support of so many people."
Martial arts fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206, but they end up only getting Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night waiting to see the Bellator 206 with its packed stands, but were eventually denied access to the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose says there are 13 battles, including six on the main card and shown live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to play, viewers in England were stunned when the screen changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unrespected after they wake up near the morning to watch the game.
One fan said on Twitter that turning the show into a children’s cartoon was like “an inadvertent joke.”
"The government stipulates that the martial arts content shown at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to turn into a children's show," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, said when asked about the move.
"Peppa the pig," he said.
Bellator President Scott Coker said it was reviewing the broadcast schedule to ensure British viewers could watch the show in the future.
Mr Coker said: "I think if we play it back, we can solve the problem."
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we can’t handle it until Sunday in our time zone, but it’s Monday in their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people change programs, there are a lot of messages back and forth and those messages are not very friendly.
We tried to fix it, initially we thought it was due to a technical glitch.
But that’s not the end of it, it’s government regulation.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of six as originally scheduled – five is the number of matches we normally offer and we have tried to provide an over-the-top offer to the fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Lost' in Sexual Orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley said that growing up, he always felt inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that was his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "I'm like nobody" until he was in school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay men’s rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to heal.
In the first issue led by Laverne, Daley appeared as an outcast, saying that he felt "lost" to everyone, because "his gender was not as socially acceptable as clear boys and girls."
To this day, the feeling of feeling inferior and different still exists, becoming the motivation and strength for me to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he had "something accomplished" so that people wouldn't be disappointed to know the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active campaigner for the LGBT community and he used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to fight discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he feels very lucky to be able to live openly without being discriminated against and wants to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion shared that he fell in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "suddenly fell in love."
Daley was married to the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a hindrance between the two.
“When you’re going through so much suffering as a child” – he first competed at the Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – it’s hard to find someone the same age as him who has experienced ups and downs in his life.
The couple became parents to young Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said that his whole "worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, my goal was ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert. He died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he took his last breath and even when he stopped breathing and died forever, I finally couldn’t admit that he had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just know that it’s the dream of my whole life – to jump bridges in front of the crowd at the Olympic Games, there’s really no better feeling than that,” he said.
This was also the inspiration for his choice of his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – which accompanied him during his training towards the Olympic Games and still moved him every time he heard it again.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST, Sunday.
Mickelson is in poor form on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to raise his form to avoid the record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in the biennial event 12 times but captain Jim Furyk left him on the bench in the fourball and foursome series on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as in the U.S., this five-time winner has to spend the day as a cheerleader and play the game in the hope of getting rid of the discomfort.
The 48-year-old with a knack for flat strokes has never been an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, even if he is at the top of his form, because the wrong shots here will suffer heavy consequences.
And if the golf course is still not haunting enough, Mickelson also has to play on the 9th match on Sunday against the champions of the Open UK Championship Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches.
If the U.S. team, which is currently losing 4 points before the start of the series of 12 singles matches, wants to start impressively, Mickelson’s match is paramount.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and didn’t say too much.
"He understands his role very well today, he pats me on the back, puts his arms around me and says he will be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I could never have imagined that he would play two games.
I imagine more, but that’s how things are going and we think that’s the right way.
He wants to play, just like all his team-mates.”
This Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record, becoming the most-played player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup because the highs of his personal record have never appeared in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and a draw, although Furyk considers his presence to be of intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, or sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people. Having him in the group is really fun," he explains.
"I think the young golfers are happy to see him and this week is quite fun.
“What he has done is more than fight.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, has experienced that even if his team has a lot of lead when entering singles matches at the end of the Ryder Cup, the result can be easily reversed in a way that is not pleasant at all.
The Dane began playing in 1997 in Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led five points ahead of the U.S. but ended up narrowly winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always have to remind yourself that we’ve been a lot ahead at Valderrama; we’ve been a lot ahead at Brookline and we’ve lost, at Valderrama, we’ve won, but we’ve been struggling,” Bjorn said, with the face imagining after watching the Class of 2018 game Friday with a 5-3 win and a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not the end.
You still have to be mentally focused tomorrow.
Go to the stadium and play well.
The tournament is not finished when the score is not yet on the table.
We have a goal to win the trophy this year and that is our focus.
I always say I focus on my 12 players, but we also understand the strength of your team – they are the best players in the world.”
Excited about the performance of his players on the bumpy golf course, Bjorn added: "I'll never say anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow will be a personal event and it will certainly be different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes well, but when you play individually, all the abilities of a player are revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with every golfer, that they have to be ready to play their best game tomorrow.
Now a pair of matches have to separate and each one has to be ready to play the best.”
Contrary to Bjorn, the rival’s captain, Jim Furyk expects his players to show better individual abilities than when playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself went both ways in great twists and turns on the last day, having been a member of the winning team at Brookline before losing while the European team was hailed as the "Miracle in Medinah."
“I remember every word,” he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, had gathered and encouraged the players before the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’ll want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the result is following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We build the squad that way and we send players out strategically and we try to do it tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked to lead the team and face Rory McIlroy in the top-flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European players in the first series.
"I chose this group, in that order because I believe that's the way to pass," Bjorn said of his singles match selection.
Germany’s new warship has been suspended from service.
According to local media reports, the German Navy’s newest destroyer was supposed to have had a test run in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warship, but it won’t be until at least next year to be able to do so due to system failures and increased costs.
The military spokesman quoted Die Zeit as saying the "Rheinland-Pfalz" test, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg destroyer, has now been delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery troubles hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen destroyer.
This means that the ships will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as radar, infrared and sound trail reduction.
Other key features include longer maintenance times – the latest destroyers could be deployed away from national ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that these modern warships – which are supposed to give Germany control of foreign countries – will become obsolete by the time they begin to use them, The Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky destroyer F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to test-fire the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return of the vessel, but German media reported a "serious software and hardware flaw", resulting in the warship being completely useless for combat duty.
The software flaw is particularly serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg will be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors – just half of the manpower on board the old Bremen destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship increased significantly, resulting in reduced performance and limited future upgrade capability of the Navy.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as the similar warships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – was also a serious problem.
The project is said to have teamed up significant capital up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the initial estimated cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of mobilization of the latest destroyers has become particularly important, given recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the navy actually “lacks warships capable of engaging in combat.”
The official said the problem was exacerbated over time, because the old ship had been decommissioned but there were no replacements.
He complained that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust has been eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats.
A new study is underway at a site in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and guide future conservation activities.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracked the journeys of common bats, soprano pipistrelles, brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the research site to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The audio analyst will analyze all the recordings and determine the frequency of the bat’s sound and the purpose of playing the sound of each particular bat genera.
After that, maps and habitat reports of bats will be created to get a detailed picture of the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how each species inhabits that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities of organisms, such as planting grasslands and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect bats’ bean rigs and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose risks to bats.
Bats are not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when stalking and catching prey.
They use an extremely sophisticated echo positioning technique to identify obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, while attaching special importance to bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, tests and sometimes participate in animal rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Managing the land, David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great habitat for bats,” he said.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of trees and a good living environment.
But there’s still a lot of mystery about bats, so work here and at other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow further.”
He stressed the importance of examining bat life before conservation in the estates, because inadvertently destroying their breeding trenches could kill up to 400 females and vomits, almost completely destroying the population.
Bats are protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb, or destroy their bean trusses.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the community to join in helping.
“We still need to learn more about bats, and with many species, we don’t know how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo Denies Rape Allegations and His Lawyers Prepare to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo says sexual allegations against him are "fake news" and that some people "want to profit" by his name.
His lawyer is preparing to sue the German daily Der Spiegel for publishing the allegation.
The Portuguese striker who plays for Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the player is believed to have paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
In a live video posted on Instagram in front of 142 million followers hours after the allegation was announced, Ronaldo, 33, said the report was "fake news".
"No, no, no.
What they said today was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to use my name for profit.
That's normal.
Speaking my name, they are famous, but that’s just part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the male added and smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, calling it “reporting unacceptable suspicions about private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in amounts corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a luxury room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room. According to records kept at Clark County Court, Nevada, he allegedly raped her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy", only "1%" was not good.
It has been reported that Ronaldo confirmed that the two sides had sex, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was photographed at the hospital, but she later agreed to mediate out of court because she was "afraid of reprisal" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn her previous reconciliation decision because she continues to be traumatized by the allegation.
At the time of the allegation, Ronaldo was preparing a transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer he moved on to play for Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ losing car maker status
Business Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its position as the world leader in post-Brexit car production.
He added that it was "worrying" for Toyota UK to tell the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a further deal, it would stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 units last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK completely leaves the European Union at the end of March then we will have to stop production at this plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is supply chain risks in the event of a Brexit without another deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “just-in-time” principle, with parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for order-made vehicles.
If Britain leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border and the sector fears it could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota said it could not keep inventory value for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union would be “precisely adjusted to avoid border checks.”
"We need to make a deal. We want to make the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we seize this opportunity well," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers shows that we need to ensure continued supply chain success.”
Toyota has not announced how long it will stop production, but in the long run, it warns that the extra cost will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the convener of the Unite union at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs are lost, there will never be again.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a reliable and accurate plan for future relations with the European Union."
White House announces meeting between President Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday that President Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “back in a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the incident of interference in the Russian election, links between Trump aides and Russia and the possibility of the President obstructing the enforcement of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and Mueller’s inability to operate independently, have been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing headphones to document conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to step down.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump — who was visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York at the time — was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while continuing to delay the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “The date has not been set yet, it is possible that this week, the reason for this postponement may be because of other issues going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll get the news soon and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike of television reporters "too much," although she once said: "I also agree that reporters are in fact a lot of things."
She then suggested that there should be more direct contact between President Trump and the press.
“The president is currently conducting more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” she added, without giving evidence: “We’ve looked at the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but "if the press had a chance to ask the president directly, that would be much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried a lot and you’ve seen us do a lot of things over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States in person.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or during news conferences when a visiting official visits.
Regular press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president was supposed to have given his reasons but he appeared suddenly in strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister Writes to European Union Employees Working in Scotland’s Health Sector to Talk About Fear of Brexit
The health minister has written to European Union employees working in the health sector in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wishes for the staff to remain post-Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that he would resign within six months of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to supporting the costs of applications to certify the status of residence of European Union citizens working in the public service sector that have been transferred.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union continued, which is expected to be decided this fall.
But the British government is also stepping up preparations for a scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know this is a bad time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I appreciate the contributions of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Furthermore, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we look forward to your stay.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
The Tennessee Tigers' long-distance defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee-based Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He ran toward the border and collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen at the border before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details on the extent/type of the injury" and that Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in the red shirt, played for the first time under the Tennessee jersey after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he had a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners who buy property in the UK will be charged higher taxes
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes, this extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory’s new policies
This Change Will Disable Success in Corbyn’s Effort to Attract Young Voters
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The finance ministry expects the policy to help raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year – to help the homeless
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
The change will successfully nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with a commitment to providing cheaper housing and targeting a high-income audience.
The tax increase will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to combat the current stagnation.
The surcharge — in addition to the current tax rate, which includes higher taxes announced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased just for that purpose — could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this change to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of new properties built in London have been sold to non-British nationals, pushing home prices higher and making it increasingly difficult for first-time home buyers.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” because the majority of expats who buy homes spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give more young people a chance to own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land but not using it, urging May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain’s “home problem.”
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rents and ending “no fault” deportations.
He also wanted to give councils more power to build new homes.
“Last year I said I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means re-regulating the housing market that is so chaotic right now.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this doesn’t mean that people who don’t live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy homes like hardworking British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a home has become too far-fetched and the stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points behind first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with the B logo and that's what I wanted," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“My childhood years were tied to those Scottish games played at Hampden with my father, and that’s always something I remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors to Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel pressure to be a successor to the big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be judged by 'can I bring the club back into the Premier League?'
The organisational structure and facilities at this club definitely belong to the Premier League,” he said.
“This is not a task to be achieved easily, but I only consider myself to be successful if I can bring the club back into the league.”
Ross spent three years as a manager, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa regain his place after relegation to the third division, and took St Mirren from the risk of relegation to champion the following season.
Ross said he felt comfortable now during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It’s probably a real turning point,” he recalls in his lead role at Alloa.
“I really believe that I am better suited to the role of manager than as a player.
This sounds strange because I was quite successful, had a good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of the job but I am satisfied with the management job.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself for the rest of my adult life.”

The summer heatwave has boosted sales for struggling pubs in the UK but added pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July – but sales at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s business consulting firm, summed up the figures, saying: “The prolonged heat and England’s entry into the World Cup round made the July sales trend similar to that of June, when pubs rose 2.8 percent, restaurants were hit harder.
Sales at restaurants slumped 1.8 percent in June, worsening in July.
Pubs and bars that specialize in beverages have the fastest growth when compared to declines in restaurants.
Taverns that specialize in food are also affected by the heat, though not as severe as restaurants.
Seems like everyone just wants to go have a drink.
Sales of beverages at managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent over the month while sales of food fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM hotel and entertainment industry analyst, said: “These results represent the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales at restaurants.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, with sales down 4.8 percent year-on-year while cost pressures continue to rise.
“The long hot summer has come at the worst time for food suppliers, not knowing in August when the weather is cooler can improve the current situation.”
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including new locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand implementation.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collected and analyzed data on work efficiency from 47 active groups, with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that’s the industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that parents don’t know about
One in five children — some aged 11 — have a secret social media account that parents and teachers don’t know about, survey shows
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found that the number of “virtual insta” pages has increased significantly.
The news has raised concerns about the rise of online pornography
Twenty percent of students say they have a “primary” account to show parents
One in five children — some 11-year-olds — are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in fake Insta accounts — a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has added to concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said children use a “primary” account with no bad content to show to their parents, while also having their own account.
A mother stumbled across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and saw a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
According to research by the UK Digital Content Awareness Association and the Rector’s Workshop (HMC) in private schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two records, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “representative of athletes” at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning track and field athlete, whose president, Ian Beattie, sees the change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her extensive competitive experience in international arenas over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish athletics community, in the UK and around the world, we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by electing her to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as the representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
An American who won gold in the 200-meter and 400-meter run at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he had all four Olympic gold medals and he is now a permanent BBC commentator, having been unable to walk after experiencing a slight stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
The doctors said only time would tell if I was recovering or in any condition.
It was a tired journey but to make a full recovery, to learn to walk again and now I am able to walk quickly!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Dairy Machine Ads Compare Mothers to Dairy Cows That Divide Online Opinion
A company that specializes in pumps divides opinion online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is considered “the world’s first wearable and noise-free dairy machine,” consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertisement inspired by the satirical music video to express the freedom that the new suction machine brings to mothers.
Four mothers danced in a cowshed full of hay to a song that sang: "Yes, I milked myself, but you don't see any tails and, "In case you don't realize, these are not breasts, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Push the milk out, suck the milk out, I'm feeding the kids, suck the milk out, suck the milk out, I'm milking my girls."
However, this ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from audiences, many of whom said the ad underestimated the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they also have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for cows that are stolen from the mother within a few days of giving birth,” one wrote.

Another commented: "This can cause psychological damage to both mother and baby.
That’s right, why not use it to advertise a breast pump to breastfeeding mothers?”
Another added: “This ad has no connection whatsoever.”
There were people who also defended the ad, one woman who admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy myself one if I still breastfeed.
Milking really makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a bit crazy but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad targeting mothers who need to suck (usually at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘cows’.
This is not ad praise or appreciation of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women revealed that they were dancing with the pump hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who suck to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump doesn’t make any noise, doesn’t have wires or tubes, and sits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold a baby, and even go outside while sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie is truly a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold introduction and encouragement of curiosity.
When comparing women to dairy cows, we want people to know about dairy products and their associated challenges, and to express in a fun and empathetic way the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time Elvie has appeared on newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of incarcerated migrant children has spiked despite the number of monthly border crossings remaining virtually unchanged, in part because the harsh arguments and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made the process of bringing children to donors even more difficult.
Traditionally, most donors have been undocumented immigrants, and they are concerned that accepting an immigrant child could jeopardize their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal governments announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to get fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for sponsorships for unguarded minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had never had a criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of donors or donor family members are here illegally, and most of them have criminal records.
So we are continuing to try these individuals,” Albence said.
According to staff working in refugee camps, to be able to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, as per the previous standards.
Many will appear through video conference calls, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are tried who are deemed ineligible for sponsorship will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more anxious or depressed they become, which can lead to violent behavior or attempts to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters say growing concern at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a struggling child more likely to be overlooked due to the size of the camp.
They added that bringing children to a refugee camp city without giving them enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends could hurt the mentality many children are suffering from.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish 'occupied forces' to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war having entered its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were already on Syrian soil illegally, in the name of counter-terrorism forces, so “will be dealt with.”
“They must withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he told the council.
Moualem stressed that the “war on terror in Syria is nearing its end”, with more than 360,000 people now dead since 2011, with millions fleeing their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "struggle in this jihad until we purge terrorist groups from the entire territory of Syria" and "the illegal presence of foreign forces".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising both Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions in the former country were good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fear" that the refugees would not return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to create conditions for the return of refugees,” he said.
“They are using political cards for humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib’s last rebel zone created an opportunity to promote political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, which is home to three million people.
Moualem, however, said the deal had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out."
U.N. special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, which includes the government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work was limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warning against meddling in elections.
Why Trump will win his second term
Logically, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency ahead of schedule, as liberals are hoping.
This is, of course, “the most dramatic performance of a presidential term!”
So far, there have been no signs of heat loss.
Since 2014, the viewership rate at golden hour has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at its golden hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers from four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” topped the cable television charts with more than 3.5 million viewers watching the main news scores.
“Even if you don’t understand it, many people are still drawn to it,” said Neal Baer, who runs ABC’s “Designated Survivor” show, referring to a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: and Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi ride in Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
You asked why?
“He said, ‘Because he made me laugh,’” Miss Scovell told me.
This is an interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any move by Washington could determine Roe v. Wade’s future, or the reunification of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only a few television viewers have the privilege of choosing their channel.
Not only that, it’s even more appealing than the news when you spend six hours watching a group of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “in-depth” information in his book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-haired bomber jacket (“a showy costume,” the Washington Post wrote) and the implications of Daniel Trump’s over-the-top dissections.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when talking about the cast and the unexpected developments on Trump’s daily TV show (like provoking N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the house on the north bank of Kauai under the 80-degree heat, but he hid inside the house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the screen especially as Brett Kavanaugh was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scale.
“I recall the days when we did those crazy programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from the outside is pouring into the hottest midterm elections for the race for the White House.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district is witnessing a rain of cash, as a reorganization of the congressional district has left two incumbents running for the same seat.
The recent cadastral rearrangement in Pittsburg County knocked out Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing against Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district, which shares multiple boundaries with the new 17th district.
The cadastral map was re-planned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former counties were rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement became a financial race between the party’s main donor organizations, the Democratic Committee on the Congressional Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on the National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb has been a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the highly watched March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th District Congressional District.
The position previously belonged to Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators have rated the Democrats higher.
The U.S. considered sanctions against El Salvador over its support for China, but later withdrew them.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing and Washington had made little objections.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and the president once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions about not recognizing Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman said earlier this month.
But the punishment only weighs for El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions for some, would be huge losses for the Central American country that now has high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings unfolded, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic issues to reschedule a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue conducting the conference, helping to end consideration of the U.S. sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, when there are signs of implementing administrative measures.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard-line message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their information was corroborated by an outside analyst who had close ties to the authorities and also spoke anonymously.
History of Research
The next bomb could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence in the public record.
It is widely believed that Mueller is shifting his investigation to the issue of collusion between Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in Congress, President Trump will have a hard time in Congress, right before the election, and even with people from the same party.
There are a lot of issues, I don’t mean that President Trump’s departure is inevitable — just like his counterparts in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices that will affect the length of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed to resist and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
History revolves around such landmarks, and the party’s uncompromising struggles will increase or delay.
Americans have to deal with some of these flaws.
What would happen if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in flames since reports last year that he suggested secretly tapping the president and speculating about the president’s inadequacy in office.
Rosenstein pointed out that the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair — or if he confirms to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote midterm for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I have learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia of Jewish descent deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Ranger ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers faced Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria, following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them an edge to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
Knee injuries prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers could use that result as a springboard for greater things.
“It’s a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We were in the game with the belief that we would get a point.
We could have won at the end of the game, but the draw was not a bad result.
They probably played better in the first half but we counterattacked in the second half and had better form.
On Thursday, it will be a big game in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the previous game, but with the support of the fans, I’m sure we can get through and get good results.
“Last year was a difficult period, I had injuries and changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
The team is good, the players have good form and good training quality.
“Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to reap a successful new season.”
Women are worried about losing sleep because of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were well aware of what they were interested in, few spoke to family members.
About half of Nationwide’s study participants said they had spoken to their spouse about long-term care costs.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about this.
“People want a family member to look after them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance business.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t mentally prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes first.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as those options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care purposes can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or buy insurance with your own money – as long as you have the money.
Carefully prepare legal documents: Avoid possible legal battles.
There is a health care plan available so that you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee the medical care process and ensure that the professional complies with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you can’t afford it.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parents were in a medical emergency and were on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details so that you are always ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about the doctors," Martin asked.
“What drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you made a plan yet?”
The man who fired multiple shots with a rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a rifle on his way home during the night.
The victim, who was about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arms.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "spontaneous act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police called for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said the death toll was expected to rise.
Contact was cut off, and aid workers were unable to get any information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a fjord on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a capital stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The capital, an administrative area under the provincial administration, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are two key sectors of the economy in Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also made landfall in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire region and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggers a tsunami that strikes 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital city of East Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake strikes one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake strikes the capital Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remember the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
The quake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic abuse
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence and opposing arrest warrants, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Government Police.
According to police reports, when a woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he grabbed the phone.
Palin is being held in custody in Mat-Su and must file a $500 non-guaranteed bail, according to KTUU’s report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was “definitely not guilty” when asked to defend himself, according to the report.
Palin faces three Class A charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a B-class light charge, jailed for one day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The case is currently being filed in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of unconsciousness related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are being posted on social media showing the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out the attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which crashed into pedestrians and cyclists on Oct. 10.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a notice of the proposed death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of attempted murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “metic planning and pre-planning,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s approach as “brutal, ruthless and inhumane.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian," the court said in a statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York executed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also ordered that the ISIS flag be displayed in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal defense lawyers, said they were “completely disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We think that the decision to carry out the death penalty instead of accepting a plea for life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of this event for those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to bring the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people" during a protest at a conservative party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European skeptics - as one of Prime Minister Theresa May's MPs has suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone said during a rally in Birmingham that the UK was "out of the coalition" now if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces when trying to reconcile deep divisions among Conservative MPs who support staying in the European Union has joined a rally against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to stick to a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, Staying Supporters and the European Union.
The allies insist she will push ahead by trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash – and force European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between their plans and the “current turmoil.”
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "oppose the Chequers plan".
He suggested Farage should stay in the Senate and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were the one responsible, we would probably be out of the coalition now,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan.”
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in world wars to be submissive to others.
We want to build our own laws.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the coalition is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people approve of the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which often does not happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us in the first place.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their seats as they keep their promises to the people.”
Farage said politicians must join the protests to "feel the heat" if they change the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do that’.
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, to feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who brought Brexit to victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists held up Conservative Party banners against Brexit after the group’s debut this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives on security issues they were facing when the conference opened.
“These are the people who once told us that they could control the IT system and all the technology provided to Canada, including free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete joke.
“Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren says he's determined to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be "determined to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future as she spoke at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, in a race with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been speculated that she could take over Trump’s position in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since President Trump took office.
An attendee asked her about her plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to get involved in politics to reform government and to have a woman at the top."
Arrested in Shooting of LSU Sims Player
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died," Sheriff Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervenes to protect his friend and is shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, possessing weapons, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and held at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 1.98-metre-tall teenager and raised at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 games in the official squad last season with an average playing time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 bouncing balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after winning over Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team at the start of the season.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and successively overtook Hamilton to defend his place in the first two laps and caused Vettel to fight his own team-mates.
Vettel got into the pit first and abandoned Hamilton when he re-entered the track, a decisive action.
The Mercedes entered the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead as the driver in the Ferrari was forced to slow down to avoid risk after two stages to defend the third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and finished seventh at the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead throughout the race when not changing tires to finish quickly and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen won fourth place.
It’s a race because Valtteri did so well over the weekend and it’s a really good driver.
In the end the team had an excellent race to win the No. 1 and No. 2," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s election campaign because she insisted she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the Supreme Court’s allegation of Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault.
Speaking during the West Virginia campaign, the president did not directly aim for the announcement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed people were “badly intentional and dishonest.”
“There’s been something going on and what’s been going on in the past few days in the Senate is amazing, you can feel the anger, you can see the people who are angry, bad and nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When they look at the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one doing that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, didn't you?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document right - "hey, what's going on?
No, no, no.
I am not leaking.”
Come on, let's wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t do that,” the president parodies the senator’s words.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and information that had been leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office leaked the information.
“I’m not hiding Dr. Ford’s allegations, I’m not leaking her story,” Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as she asked."
But the president seemed dissatisfied with her denial and he commented during the campaign on Saturday night: "I'll tell you about that, it's really very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president argued that Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You’ll see the meaning and the discomfort because they don’t care who they hurt, they want power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday’s loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League by winning 5-3 in the second leg at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two early goals thanks to goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie drew for the home team before Dwyer scored extra points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard went on to equalize for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the final.
It was the team’s third defeat in the Elite League season led by Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in a game played in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwy's opening goal in the fourth minute when the clock was just 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the goal four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the home team shorten the score in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became the player that helped Cownie level the score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when scoring the second goal at the end of the half.
The hosts consulted and Bouchard once again leveled the score with a spectacular score in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second half and he scored fifth for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants, which have lost four of their last five games, are now resting to await their next game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers have sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of passengers on the plane from the earthquake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as heroes after sacrificing their lives to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rage in the area and many people are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed behind to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it had collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we received this news,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have not reached many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there is an ambulance carrying the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know what the situation is like there.
It’s a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I hope you will all work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crash in Micronesia
The operator of the plane, which crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, said one man was missing, after earlier statements that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we had not been able to find a male passenger.
The airline said it had worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all remained in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events have not yet been determined.
Aviation and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the sea shortly after leaving the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane was missing a runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through deep water to the waist to reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the wharf also helped rescue people by using pontoon boats to pick them up before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety net shows 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in the PNG network over the past two decades, but there have been no incidents involving Air Niugini.
Analysis reveals the time on the night the girl was burned alive
The plaintiffs base their case on Saturday during a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use the mobile log to synthesize the movement of 21-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from a number of mobile phones indicating that Tellis had been with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers’s during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police officer who interrogated Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lies because my truck is in Nashville.”
Another contradictory detail is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show that they have only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that sometimes after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and communications from his phone.
“He’s erased you from his life,” Hale said.
The defense attorney is expected to begin the closed-door debate on Sunday.
The judge said he expected a jury trial that day.
High Breed: What Is Positive Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wanted to oppose the negative views of the genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
The High Breed team, from Bristol, claimed hip hop was no longer communicating political messages and addressing social issues.
The group wanted to bring the genre back to its roots and repopulate positive hip hop music.
Recently artists such as Fugees and Common have gained more fame in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
NY teen sues couple who fired her after "racist" message
A nanny in New York sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she received a wrong message from her mother complaining that she was "a black person."
The couple rejected them as racists, calling the case a "blackmail."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed frustration when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After noticing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, who said the African-born nanny who was about to quit had done a bad thing and that she hoped to have a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid a day’s wages and went home on her own.
Maurice is now suing the couple for dismissal with $350 a day in compensation over a six-month period for the work she was hired to do to receive the money despite not signing any contract.
“I want to show them, look, you can’t do things like that,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to the allegations that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment for fear that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she wasn’t going to send.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you’ve offended, even by mistake?
What about the newborn baby?
Tell me."
When comparing the case to a “blackmail case,” Plasco said his wife had given birth two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case was taking place, public opinion quickly turned to the couple on social media, disparaging their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington publishers fear that readers won’t care about the story of a talking bear, the letter said.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, the letter revealed: "It's hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes when reading the book was first published.
It’s great that we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
When talking about his father, a videographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when his work was rejected, she added in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication, which was a “confusion of sadness” after his death last year.
When talking about Paddington, she described it as "a very important member of our family," adding that her father had always been quietly proud of her success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not an energetic guy," she said.
“But because Paddington really exists for him, it’s almost like you have a child and it’s been a success: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you've treated Paddington's actions that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a certain place for Paddington.”
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“I call Nad often to say it’s bad and she shouldn’t have to,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
Doctors pumped her heart medicine and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not over.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was with my family and everyone else.
I must be the one who binds them.”
At last Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
“Nobody knows,” she said.
“I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves her.”
Woman Posts Postcards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop others from robbing themselves of their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Davis’s son Tyler, then 13, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a rich laugh.
“Everyone knows it because of the laughter.
They used to say that his laughter lit up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, passed away like his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction.”
Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are always people you can meet, chat with or even make friends with.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He’s not talking about feeling bored or frustrated or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he changed his attitude.
He’s bored at school on Christmas Day – when the kids open presents and he doesn’t have an eye for them or anything around him.”
She said that her husband's death was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to get through: "This has caused a big hole in our family.
It broke our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
Flake said on Saturday that “I think, if we can really get something like what you’ve asked for – a limited investigation of time, a limited scope, we can collect a little bit,” adding that he feared the committees would “get entangled” in party squabbles.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is only a matter of time.
The midterm elections have gone through five weeks, on Nov. 6—if as expected, Republicans who are now in a very poor state will be even weaker in their efforts to find the representative they want to elect to the highest office.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying in favor of Kavanaugh, who had been a White House aide under President Bush, from there accessible to his wife Ashley, who had been President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 are Republicans and 49 are Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 Senate votes, allowing Mike Pence, now vice president, to untie the knot and confirm his candidacy in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'declined sharply' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has plummeted since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year – compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the large percentage of smugglers detained were key factors of the change.
Pyjama did not make public comments.
Most of the defectors from North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the fugitives fled through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and they could easily cross the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China regards defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea – technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves come after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed to expanded terms for a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for causing delays in the process.
“Without any confidence on the American side, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a case, there is no other way we will unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a “radicalist,” and says he is not fit for the position in the Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a “radicalist” and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview that took place Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help, but I think if a woman ever did that they would call it a ‘radicalist,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh showed a lot of emotion, at times he almost cried and choked at talking about his family and his five months in high school.
He also strongly denounced the Democratic Party in front of the committee, calling the charges against him a "well-planned assassination" due to anger over Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was unfit for the position in the Supreme Court, as he clearly demonstrated anti-democratic behavior.
“I think he removed himself from his status by making his statements and his treatment of the Clintons and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not just in the Supreme Court, he’s going to have to testify in court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s ability to make a ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“This isn’t a time for someone who’s radical, biased in court and hopefully we’ll say, ‘This isn’t great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This was really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year the anger grew even greater, and she couldn’t get over it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, and you?”
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman, she was a senior director, she said she also cried when she was angry but to form a reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she just talked to, 'You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And you continue to cry.
And I think this is great.”
You’re allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of the way out of rage because they’re basically being misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at my first company was that it was a men’s-only place, and I used to cry when there was an outburst of anger, and that was when an older woman – the cold manager who always scared me – pulled me down the stairs.
She told me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’re with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and was left out of the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
Thirty years later she laughed and said to me, “It wasn’t a wise decision.”
“There are already seven other candidates in the race, and they need another one.
Someone called this race "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to her late involvement in the campaign, she lost the fundraising campaign, so she vowed that she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She found that some supporters gave her $250 instead of $1,000 to support the male candidate.
She wondered, “Do they think I have a discount?”
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame the emotion – expressing gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and targeted voters rather than delegates, angered at being sexist – that she was so choking.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of how the press had reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was my company’s sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my gravestone.
"Are you crying?"
US-China trade war could be a good sign for Beijing
Experts say that the prelude to the trade war between the United States and China has stalled, and the war will continue, and the rift between countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued his first warning by slapping tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The escalation has increased in recent weeks with tariffs worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) hitting half of Chinese imports into the United States.
Beijing has retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in response to the U.S. action, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be shaken soon.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make demands, but publicly giving in to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can come up with the right moves, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can start an economic relationship in either country and this is actually far more dangerous than what was previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research expert at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to let refugees return voluntarily and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been ravaged by a seven-year war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the national situation is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions
All current conditions are available for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and the economic conditions affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the nation would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that financed the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points when beating the American team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has participated in most of the tournament, threw his shot into the water at his third attempt at the 16th hole, admitting he lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shines in all rounds and has become one of only four players to have won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played the last Ryder Cup game of his career.
A veteran player of eight Ryder Cup seasons, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the greatest champion of every tournament with a total score of 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop it today.
This has been a really tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I was so happy to get the cup.
As for my team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said of the post-European sentiment.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"It's a proud moment to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and I admire him very much," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup tournaments.
The statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major trophies and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were first among the tournament's highly qualified golfers.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they fought so well.
This morning we had a hard time due to the high temperatures in Europe.
We've been eliminated.
I want to honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in the team played very well.
“We will regroup the squad, I will play the PGA in the US and the Ryder Cup and we will continue to be at the top of the table.
I love all 12 players and I am proud to be captain.
I salute you with my hats.
We played very well.”
Red tides: Red tide density decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that red tide density has declined in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, algae blooms have been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – which causes red tide densities to drop.
Red tides spread for about 130 miles along the northern coast of Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Small patches were also found within 10 miles of Hillsborough County, but fewer sites than last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium density along the coast or off the coast of Pinellas County has been reported over the past week, low to high density off the coast of Hillsborough County, low to high density in Manatee County, low to high density off the coast of Sarasota County, low to high density in Charlotte County, low to high density along the coast or offshore in Lee County, and low density in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritability has not been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
