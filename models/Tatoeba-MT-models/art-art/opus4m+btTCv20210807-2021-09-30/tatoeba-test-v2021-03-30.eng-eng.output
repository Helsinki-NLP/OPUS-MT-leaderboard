I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my dream.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There is a wide supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom diris ke li sciis ke Maria eble ne rajtas fari tion.
I would do the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure that no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom is busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom could not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Was he in touch with you?

I think that book is not so interesting.

I think our team will continue to get better.
I want someone to help me with that.
Tom definitely knows that he should not be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a great responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing this.
Tom diris, ke Maria estis tro maljuna por fari tion.
I should know that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn’t know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody knows that I am here.
I'm glad I left Australia.

Tom told me he would try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.

Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.

Look at this high mountain.
She is still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
He probably gets angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I am a libertarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.

Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
Tom is a little older than Mary is.

He is a smartest boy.
How is your father?
Tom said that Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom does not become jealous.

It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look late to him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.

Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary is not awake.
Did anyone have Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind.
We married seven years ago.
I could do that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could do that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that correctly.
She is in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better at French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would do that?
That's his home.
I am at home.
You don’t need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.

They promised that they were checking on it.
I'm sure Tom would agree.

Tom is not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.

It's obvious Tom can't do that without any help.

Tom could ask me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would do that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.

Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home every Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is fun with what's going on?
We have not yet started to fight.
Who knocks on the door?

They said they're supportive.
I thought it would be a great idea.
What you say is shocked everyone.

We walked around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they did not work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do anything like that.
You are so hot!

Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.

You are as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.

Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You are a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We are late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of plaf with some kebabs is a sky on Earth.
Tom kaj Maria rakontis al Tom ke ili planis fari tion.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have email.
If something sounds too good to be true, it is probably.
Tom diris, ke li esperas, ke vi ne volas fari tion.
Tom said that he wanted that he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.

I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who is the lucky guy?
They pretended that they didn't know me.
Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not going to do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned back there.

I don't think you should drive.
We hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.

It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do this.

Can you cook a litter?
Tom said he knew I was coming.

We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.

I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.

I'll see it that's done.
I wear a suit but wear no there.
I am tired as you.

You are both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe that Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.

We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that soon.
Have I ever told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen years old.

I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it OK if I ask Tom to help me?

I knew that Tom would not be a very good teacher.
I didn’t know you were rich.

No one ran.
Tom said she would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we.
He said that these shoes were too expensive.
Tom diris, ke li sciis, ke li eble ne bezonas tion.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't as an eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't tickled.

I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.

It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm glad to meet you.

Tom said I should let you drive.
What is your favorite fast-food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?

The clock stopped.
Tom and I grew up in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom will be back soon.

I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It is not open for debate.
Tom told everyone he was unemployed.
I know that will be hard to do.
How do you plan to do this?
It's beyond me.
I am slightly out of shape!
Did you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It will be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
Ili volis, ke ili ne diris tion.
I wonder if Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one is around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn’t defend himself.
So what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.

My book is better than Tom's.
Hello, what is your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
Mi scias, ke Tom sciis, ke mi planis fari tion.
You should have been able to do so much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you're not the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's the reason Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they would find someone else.
Mi estis la sola, kiu sciis, ke Tom ne volis fari tion.
I doubt that Tom did that on the purpose.
I think you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.

They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should introduce myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to be withdrawn.
I cannot remember when he moved to Boston.
I never fell in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about this.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I don’t think anyone thought you're crazy.
He hasn't got to mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John could not be allowed to do that by himself.
There is no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he had no permission to do this.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many miles have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are okay.
I'm a dispicable human being.

I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing this.
Where do you learn to do this?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't going to help us do that.
