You tricked me!
You have big head.
You have a leaf in your hair.
You want to split taxes with me?
You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?
You were planing to take pictures, didn't you?
You were skinny the first time I met you.
You were surprised that I did, aren't you?
You'll be allowed to leave soon.
You won't do anything like that.
You know the truth one day.
You're going to need video card to play this game.
You'll never be as cool as I am.
You'll never be smart.
You'll pay for that.
You'll stay here until you're calling.
You'll suffer because of that.
You'll work on the beach.
You would like the movie.
