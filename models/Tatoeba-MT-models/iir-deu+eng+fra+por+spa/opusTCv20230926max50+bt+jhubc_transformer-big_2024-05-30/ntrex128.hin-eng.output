Welsh AM (assembly member) are concerned with 'mapet-like images'
Some members of the Assembly are hesitant to suggest that the title of his post should be changed to MWP (Welsh MP).
The reason for this is that it is planned to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs concerned about the scope of politics are concerned that it can make them laugh.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned about "not connecting it to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living out of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirty.
A Plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent thinker" about the name change, but noted that the MWP could have been tampered with by making small verbal changes to the words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal amendment to the name, said: "The final decision of any narrator in this regard as to what the members of the Assembly are called will certainly be a matter of their own for the members."
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of public consultations on proposals that had received considerable support to rename the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AM position title, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMP, but found the MWP option to be the most supported in public advice.
Obviously, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but with Presiding Officer Elin Jones having difficulty getting consensus, he hopes to submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The law making being prepared for the changes will also include other changes in the manner of work in the Assembly, including the rules for disqualification of AM and the format of the committee system.
At the time of debating lawmaking, AM will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians are going to vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether or not they have to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was bid to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor speaks of its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a rival of the public's opinion on the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of Prime Minister Zoran Zeev as well as the poll have argued that the name change is only a means of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing as churches in Harlem are decreasing
"The elders I spoke to about history have said that there were bars and churches at every nook and corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, it's all over."
It makes sense to reduce the number of times.
He said, "Today, people's society is forming in a different way."
"The bars are no longer like neighborhood living rooms where people go every day."
For churches, they worry that the money they sell will not last as long as leaders expect, “and that money will soon run out or those leaders will come to exactly where they started.”
He further added that the churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of people living there who would not help keep the remaining places of worship around safe.
"There will be a growing number of people in these buildings who are buying houses as a proprietary right, and so there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of them who are getting proprietary rights will become members of these churches," he said.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, both churches were built by white people of religious society before Harlem's Black Metropolis - the Metropolitan Community.
The original whites of the Methodist religious society moved into the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who used to worship at nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was occupied by a black religious society under that clergyman John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, the place was the leading place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the bells started to ring after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin, Pastor David Johnson, proudly called the clockwork "opening the doors of fortune to the poor."
The bell-playing expert in July described it as something like this: it is “a cultural heritage” and “a valuable historical instrument”.
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first clock played by black musician Dionecio A. Lind, who played a huge clock at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveder said no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin over the past few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by common leaders of the church and the rest by provinces associated with religion.
The parish (priests of the house) made up of common leaders on the westery (where worship goods are kept) became the authority - in July the province raised concerns that the province would "demand to meet costs" for the westery, regardless of whether or not the westery involved in hiring craftsmen and contractors appointed in the province.
Some pastors in the area complained of lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured by an attack by a shark while diving to catch a crab
Officials say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, when he was holding a crab diving in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach, Ancinitas, before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV, said Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour, at the same time he heard a boy screaming for help and then he arrived with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammelle said that at first he felt like the boy had voiced the excitement of catching the crab, but then he realized he was yelling, "I'm biting something!"
I'm cutting something!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire thigh was torn.
"I called everyone out to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!"
The teenager was admitted to San Diego's Ready Children's Hospital where his condition is stated to be critical.
The attacking shark species has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in an interview with the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Gills further stated that the upper spot of the torso of the victim is seriously injured.
Authorities have blocked beach access for 48 hours from Ponto Beach of Casblad to Swamys Beach of Asinitas.
There are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous, Giles said.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to hire expert assistants to include department store-style boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
Despite the continued decline in sales of fashion goods and home goods, it is going to join the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market with good volumes, these massive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, the business will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwave and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of products offered for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup products, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-sized shoppers somewhat faster.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrances Shop will also check out the special feature at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is scheduled to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e., shifts in the daily quantity of food sold in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coop, said people would come to the outlet more quickly, as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl, which have more services and non-food discounts.
Sainsbury's has been putting out Argos' outlets in hundreds of stores and has opened a number of stores since it came to both chains two years ago, revealing that grocery sales have been boosted and the deal has been made more lucrative.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to bring beauty and pharmacy products back to the market was met with failure.
Sainsbury's had a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the combined business had to be scrapped due to the way in which incomes from drug stores in its supermarkets were split.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, Celescio, for 125 million pounds, after which a new strategy emerged.
Lloyds will play a key role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as a number of top luxury skincare brands in four stores, it said.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained colleagues who will help us in giving advice.
We have built the scope of our brand according to the needs and attractive surroundings of every person and in convenient places, which means we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Holly Willoughby's departure from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, Peter Jones reveals 'Narazgi'
To focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV when TV presenter Holly Billuby decided to separate from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for the lifestyle brand business of Star Peter Jones of Dragons Den, Peter Jones appeared to be 'unbelievable' on it.
Bilubi doesn't have time for his homeware and accessories brand, really.
The business of the two was being compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced her separation on Instagram.
Holly Billuby separated herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute with the star Peter Jones of Dragons Den - so she could focus fully on her new best contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources revealed that when TV’s Golden Girl admitted during a stressful meeting at Jones’s business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she was diverging from her new deal – worth 1.5 million pounds – Jones seemed to be upset enough to give Keezy no time, which means that now Bluby’s brand and X have their homeowner.
The turnover was being compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was being considered to double from the estimated 11 million pounds offered by Vilubi.
The 37-year-old Willubi announced on Instagram that she was truly separating, after Jones moved from the UK to visit her one of her holiday homes.
A source said: “Holly’s priorities were truly at the top ever.
It was considered to be its long-term future, with this brand going a long way in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in this business.
What happened on Tuesday, no one could be sure, it was very close to starting.
The warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters is full of goods to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the UK's richest star could cost the firm several million dollars as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewares and is likely to delay the launch.
It can also end a long friendship.
Billuby's three children and husband, Dan Baldwin, have been very close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for the past ten years.
Vilubee made his debut with Cape in 2016 and joined Jones as chairman in March.
Couples and Jones, who spend holidays together at Baldwin's TV production firm, own 40 per cent.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host I'm a Celebrity of ITV.
"We wouldn't want to talk about their business case," a close source told Jones last night.
"We've had some serious discussions, and we've agreed."
He mocked the criticism, saying the news media would continue to comment on him, saying some would consider it a "distinct job from the presidency" and would be much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump done so much?
Trump said in his showbiz "News anchor" voice.
"I did not sacrifice anyone."
He said Kim’s interest is in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear-free.
However, nuclear-free negotiations were halted.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not waiting for a "consistent response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. has continued to create pressure to maintain sanctions.
Trump's rally speech saw a very optimistic outlook.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
which killed millions of people.
Now our relationship has gotten really good."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, including completing the rocket test, helping to free the hostages and repatriating the remaining U.S. troops to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to remain president, but 10,000 people from outside the country are trying to join the region, we will only have about 200 people to stop them," Trump said, directly pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake hit an island in Indonesia, dozens dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told for the event that they did not need them.
Despite the loss of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international assistance.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly not asking for international help, so it became a bit more challenging," said Ms. Sumbu.
Still, Save the Children visited Palu with a team, but it is not yet clear whether employees from other countries can come here to help.
"""Indonesian officials were monitoring Palu's situation to see if contributions from international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort,"" said Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency."
Given such situations repeatedly occurring in Indonesia, it seems that this country is not being prepared at all for the outbreak of nature.
Although shelters have been built for people suffering from a tsunami in Eich, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Palu has seen a decrease in sirens warning for a tsunami, no matter how damaging that warning may be, it is likely to increase life damage.
No matter what the best time to visit Indonesia is, it is difficult to cross the Indonesian islands.
Arrangement of workers and goods from natural disasters is always complicated.
Victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok, which is far from Palu and takes at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very bad infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko's administration was scattered due to lack of funds as elections are due to be held again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made religious ideologies more orthodox.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 were left homeless, as Christians and Muslims were fighting each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge bows in mysterious way to equal Chelsea
At Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from being ruled out of the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute.
From a distance of about 30 yards, Sturridge got close to Zerdan Shakiri, at the time his team was trailing 1-0 by the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left leg before making the Far Post shot.
His effort went towards the top right corner of the net with the height above the box.
The ball eventually fell out of the hold of the capa arizabalaga and went into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get into that position to get in touch with the ball and take it as far away as possible from players like Shake, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and touching once and not thinking too much about it and just hit the shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead in the halftime after Belgium's finest player Aiden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball came close to the midfield and reached the Liverpool half game, the Blues striker gave the pass to Matteo Kovasik in that game.
Kovasik reached the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, they beautifully shot at the ball, leading Hazard to the box.
Hazard stepped out of the defense and fired a shot from the left leg behind Liverpool's Allison Baker and sent away from the net.
Liverpool will now face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3 pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 pm in London on Thursday.

The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, it was re-recorded in History
Its deportation would be the ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, such as its Taliban, created by his radical Purinton followers.
However, the Cromwell Society cited Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “The ongoing debate on the removal of the statues was full of apprehensions that Oliver Cromwell’s statue would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
There was no order for the symbol of the English Civil War nor was Cromwell built it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell would have renounced his ancestor Thomas' works in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorocroft, Cromwell's finest representation is evidence of the 19th-century idea and part of the history of a statue that many still find admirable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps for this reason most people still know him today as the protector of Parliament against external pressures in the late 19th century in terms of monarchy.
Nevertheless, they are considered to be absolutely accurate representatives, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is evident that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell’s statue remains a personal identity that reflects one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are admirable and memorable.
Deadly pig attacked Chinese farmer, killing farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer at a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", had been found with serious wounds on his body, his body lying bloodthirsty near a pig market in Liupansui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xinjiang, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs.
He allegedly came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs along with his cousin, who lives in the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that the door of a pig bar was open nearby.
He said that a large male pig appeared in the pig-bar with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked and killed the farmer.
According to Guiang Evening News, her Kazan with the surname "Wu" said, "My Kazan's legs were bloodthirsty and completely injured."
Security camera footage showed the yuan coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig who attacked the man and killed him was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked so that it could not attack a person, although police collected evidence after examining the scene.
Family members of the yuan and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of people being attacked by pigs in the past as well.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband at their farm causing the person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a farmer in the Welsh, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife frightened the animal.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was attacked by his pigs and killed and made his own food, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but can be “dangerous” if they taste blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite off the tooth and are very searching...they are not there to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Heavy rains in southwestern U.S. due to the remaining part of Hurricane Rosa
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker due to the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, there will be flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
According to Eastern Time on Sunday, the wind speed recorded in Rosa at 5 a.m. was 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 storm, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is heading towards the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa is due to arrive near the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much tropical moisture will begin to fall in the northern parts of southwestern America.
On Monday, there will be 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough combined with the tropical moisture will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris flow and landslides in the desert.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 3 inches at some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwestern part, especially most parts of Arizona, is likely to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains, there can be heavy flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rains, advisory will be given to stay out of the low-lying desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become risky rivers and strong winds and dust will blow in local areas along with thunderstorms.
Due to the incoming trough, locally heavy rainfall will occur in some parts of the southern California coast.
The total rainfall is likely to be more than half an inch, leading to some debris flowing and slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first rain in the region.
Rainfall is likely to begin in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before it becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rains in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in October as the Arctic weather gets cooler at this time, but in tropical areas there is a lot of heat.
Sometimes this short distance leads to poor temperature changes.
The unusual change in temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
The temperatures range between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the weather will start getting warmer and the heat will increase.
In most parts of Central and Eastern U.S., the weather is expected to be warm from October, which is likely to be widespread in the 80s from the southern plains to some areas of the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Celsius, about 10 degrees above average.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting signals that there is a good chance that the temperatures in the early six months of October will be higher than the average temperature in the eastern U.S.
More than 20 million people have listened to Brett Cavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the Supreme Court hearing of Brett Cavanaugh and the trial of the woman who accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, the hearing was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political stalemate was also seen, broadcasters stalled Friday’s regular program of Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered By Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI’s Jeff Flake after investigating the allegations for up to a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that Cavanaugh at a high school party tried to get him drunk and stripped of his clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself saying that he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
More than 20.4 million people are expected to see the Nielsen report on Friday.
The company was counting the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channels and MSNBC.
The figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, as well as other channels showing it, were not readily available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating what people see in the offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of viewers of a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen said the Fox News channel, which the thought-provoking host has overwhelmingly supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it came in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
People were very interested in hearing.
On Friday, Flake was the central figure in the drama.
A statement issued after the office of the Liberal Republican said they would raise voices on behalf of Cavanaugh, who appeared in front of the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when the protesters were shouting to oppose the Judicial Committee's hearing.
When he was being called abusive, he stood there blinking his eyes for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Please, I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think they're telling the right thing to the country?"
They were asked, "Have you been brought to power to make many women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was shut down and that he would be able to keep his full say in the committee hearing.
While the Judiciary Committee was pushing Cavanaugh's nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, the cable and broadcast channels were still showing things live several hours later.
But Fleck said he would do so with full understanding that the FBI will look into the charges against the named individuals next week, which are being urged by minority Democrats.
Flake talked about it with his friend, Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After negotiating with Coons and several senators, Fleck took his decision.
Flake liked power because it was clear that allowing Cavanaugh without an investigation would not allow Republicans to vote.
President Trump has approved the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of doing politics over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop playing politics in the EU and focus their full attention on the national interest by making it a "game" for Britain's future.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
On the front page of the newspaper, right next to his interview, an interview with his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on himself due to the so-called checkers plan of Brexit, his statement was that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other, which is "completely pointless".

Police clash with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained following clashes of pro-independence protesters with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of rivals joined the protests on the first anniversary of being celebrated to vote on secession in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-Separatists threw eggs and powder paint on the riot police, which blackened the road dust, causing inconvenience to commuters.
The police used batons to control the clashes and later resorted to scuffle.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forget, No Forgiveness," while union protesters chanted "Spain remains immortal."
According to a local press report, 14 people who were injured due to the protest were treated.
Madrid says the October 1 referendum, considered illegal, has been raising tensions in independently-held areas for a year, but Catalonian separatists have been celebrating it.
Voters chose a very good approach to freedom, although there were few people who strongly opposed voting against segregation.
Catalonian officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
Groups supporting independence stayed there overnight on Friday to assist the National Police in stopping the protest.
The protest was moved forward, but he was forced to take a different decision.
Narcisse Terminus, a 68-year-old electrician who accompanied his wife to attend the separatist protests, said he saw no prospect of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Our best year was last year.
I saw my parents cheering by voting, but it seems we're stuck now," he said.
Even with a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia’s pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence this year with many of their famous leaders, whether in exposing themselves or in waiting for the ballot to be organized and their role in the continuation of the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone to help the police, said the clash between politicians on both sides had been halted.
"It's been very stressful," she said.
On Saturday, Orol Junckers, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia involved in a pre-trail prison since last year, announced that they would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the withdrawal that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested for assaulting house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for repeatedly assaulting a Londonderry home.
The incident took place at around 9:30 pm on Thursday.
Deputy inspector Bob Blemmings said the house's doors and buildings were damaged.
Crossbows may have been attacked by a car in some places.
Menga beat Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal ensures Livingston's win
According to the manager of the Ebrox Club, the fast-moving Livingston shocked the Rangers, which led to Steven Gerrard taking responsibility for his second loss in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side move with Hybrid in the second half of the match.
Gerrard's side was a step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the Leaders Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has been consistently winning in the six-game division by replacing Kenny Miller last month with head coach Holt.
Livingston failed to show his game to the visitor
Holt's team should have overtaken him long before scoring, as well as the Rangers had a lot of problems because of their great game.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was left behind by an attempt to score a goal, then Alan Lithgow was able to stay direct while doing his best to complete the goal in Craig Lightheight's header.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitors in trouble on the set-piece.
And that's why he got the important goal.
The Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston did the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson doing the job of setting up the Menga, who did a touchdown and scored from the center of the box.
On that stage, the Rangers had consolidated their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left behind,
This pattern also continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos insisted on being savvy on Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor on foot and Lithgow took full possession of the game by flicking from the second Livingston.
The Cross in the Livingston Box continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while two penalty claims were made after the lightweight challenge, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Analysis of Livingston's "Extraordinary Goal"
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont inducted into Tony Macaroni Arena
The extraordinary performance and results of Livingston.
For any person, they were excellent, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His style and personality have changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but most credit goes to Holt's way in which he has reshaped the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of great players.
The captain was a great player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warle behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in Rangers.
The kind of great performance he has done under Gerrard many times was less than his standard.
Their final ball was lacking - they were only able to cut to their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was welcomed in Cologne.
When Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the smiles were scattered, but there was no benefit.
This is President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They remained stuck in controversies on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's ascendancy into the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the areas with the largest number of Turkish residents.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, some of whom were Kurdish, also shouted slogans, strongly condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom regarded him as a German Turk hero and others who insulted him by calling him a voluntarist ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: Bicycle rider dies after being hit by car
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST in the southeastern part of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver of the car stopped the car and received first aid, but the person died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run at Children's Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Such incidents are taking place due to road turn and bus diversion and drivers have been advised not to venture into such areas.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured in mishap
The prisons office said six prison officials were injured as a result of a disturbance in the prison of high-security men.
At around 9:30 BST on Sunday, something went wrong at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still going on.
Specialist "Tornado" officials have been called to fix the mess, this mess is in a wing in which eight inmates are kept.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the spot which were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to correct the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the injured have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they can be imprisoned.”
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of them being the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jail governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the jail governor was treated in the hospital.
In addition, riot officials were called to jail in October last year to fix a serious disorder, during which an employee was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens rapid flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical conditions remain threatened after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is likely that it is already the only one that could affect the remaining capacity of the storm in the coming week, posing a high risk of flooding in the Desert Southwest.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that there is a possibility of severe flooding in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah of western Arizona.
The rains on Monday evening are expected to pass through the entire Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950 have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the hurricane AZ border."
More recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that there may be 2 to 4 inches of rain in Arizona's Mogolon rim, as well as, it is likely to be up to 6 inches.
Rainfall from 1 to 2 inches is likely over Central Rockies and the Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, as well as up to 4 inches.
Outside of areas at high risk of flooding, Rosa's rainfall may prove to be a boon as the area is dry.
Although the floods remain a serious concern, drought conditions remain in the southwest, which is likely to benefit greatly from the rains.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is very dry, making it the second-highest-grade drought," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed of Hurricane Rosa was 85 miles per hour, at the time it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is currently moving northwards at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific region, due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of tropical storms may cause landslides in Mexico at noon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rains are likely in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to Northwestern Sonora, at the same time, it is also likely to be 10 inches," according to weather.com's report.
After that, Rosa will travel across Mexico on Tuesday morning, before reaching the northern side of the Arizona border, followed by the southern side of Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The biggest threat from Rosa or its remaining parts is to California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rain is likely," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that heavy rains and flooding in deserts and debris inflows are likely to endanger public finances and lead to landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four people detained for plot to murder
A 16-year-old minor was found injured in Somerset, where she was attacked with a knife for which the suspect has been detained in a conspiracy to murder three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found injured at the Accelsier Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital for treatment where his condition is stated to be “okay”.
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from the Redstock area.
Officials have also appealed to people to get in touch if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump described Kavanaugh's trouble as the anger of the Democratic Party.
"Justice Kavanaugh is a person who has been rejected by the brutal and derogatory tactic of the Democratic Party," Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble that Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress of allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford in his teens several decades ago, while cleaning, Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally denied this.
During the hearing, Ford also gave his testimony about the charge.
"The people of the United States saw the virtue and courage of being the finest human being of that day," the President said on Saturday.
"Voting for Justice Kavanaugh means voting for a person who is one of the most skilled jurists of our time, who can confirm the law and do justice with a genuine record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"There are only five weeks left, from the election that is most important to our lives.
I'm not involved, but I'm actually involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are truly qualified."
Trump said Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and block."
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the Senate's first count of votes in Kavanaugh's nomination will begin on Friday.
Earthquake, tsunami kills hundreds in Indonesia, death toll rises
Officials said Saturday that when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, high tides began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being held on the beaches of the city of Palu in which hundreds of people gathered, when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave erupted in the evening, triggering devastation that killed many and destroyed everything around them.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, the people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately and got stuck in it,"" said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB at the briefing in Jakarta."
"Tsunami not only caused people to die, but it also dragged cars, logs and houses to the ground, wrapping them up. Tsunami traveled to the open sea at speeds of 800 kmph (497 mph) before attacking the beach," Nugroho said.
He said that in order to avoid the tsunami, some people climbed trees and defended themselves.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
Photos posted by the disaster agency from the plane showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torched and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The post-traumatic shock continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced a continuous earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more energy than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It said that the geography of the city situated at the end of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho elaborated on the damage, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people were yet to be identified, he said.
Damage and damage is very likely to occur in Dongla, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, close to the epicenter of the quake, Nugroho said.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Dongla was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
“At first it was a tragic event, but it could be even more terrible,” it said.
On Saturday, the agency criticised why it was not informed earlier if there was a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already come.
A man made some videos amateurically and posted on social media which can be seen that the position on the upper floor of the building was giving a voice to a person on the street downstairs and could hear a terrifying warning.
Within a few minutes, too much water began to flow out of the middle and the buildings and cars were pulled along.
Reuters was not able to verify the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut off communication lines, making it difficult for authorities to link rescue efforts together.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo planes, officials said, adding that there is still a need to evacuate people and meet other requirements as well as food.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed in October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
This is very terrible.
Mr. Doseba informed that the World Vision staff in Dongala made every effort to make Palu city safe, the staff living in the premises of their offices by making tarpaulin shelters, they have seen the devastation with their own eyes.
He said, "When talking to him, he came to know that he saw a lot of houses being destroyed."
This is very terrible.
Aid groups began seriously bringing supplies for disaster relief, with some complaining that outside aid personnel with specialised expertise were being barred from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, goods and staff from abroad can be taken only if the disaster zone is declared as a national disaster zone.
But that has not been done yet.
"The disaster is still at the province level,"" said Aulia Aryanani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross."
"Ok, this is a national disaster, only after the government has said that we can involve international aid personnel in rescue operations but that has not happened yet."
People whose friends and family members could not be traced in Palu even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday had hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously found somewhere as natural disasters do.
On Saturday, a small boy was found trapped in the sewer.
A woman was rescued by a rescue team on Sunday and her baby was trapped in the rubble for two days next to her.
Gandon Subando, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two paragliders of the Asian Games to identify the missing, who had been dedicated to it since early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi was among those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
"""As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally stressed."
Mr. Gendon said that the paragliding community started its work only after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had been received, he had sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu contestants participating in the mid-festival.
However, there are only gray marks on his message, not blue marks on it.
"I think that means that messages can't reach people," he said.
Thieves looted $26,750 at Levy's Newport ATM
According to a report released by the Newport Police Department, a Brink employee was putting money into an ATM in Levy's Newport on Friday morning, while the thieves stole $26,750.
Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was vacating an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put in more money.
When he was busy with his work, “someone ran behind Brink’s employee” came and ran away with the money bag he had put in.
According to the report, many people present at the spot are suspected, but police have not yet been able to ascertain the total number of people present at the spot.
Any person who has information related to their identity should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name.
About the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Officially, his name will be Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been named for a while and will use the name for the title moniker of his eighth album, released in June.
This change is being made in his presence at Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandy.
The makers of the show said they removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had already pointed out that the term had religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'yes' has been used several times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
So I am you, I am us, it is us.
This word is derived from Kanye, which means only one, which is just this - it reflects our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album depicts who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs also has several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has kept his names Love and Brother Love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of the West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed that military force will never be used for civilians again after the country completes 50 years of deadly retaliation against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador at Telteleco Plaza promised that “military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the peaceful movement in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading across Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico, give grants every month to students studying and open more and more free government universities.
He said that due to unemployment and less opportunities to get education, the youth join the perpetrators.
The U.S. should double the amount of funding it provides for AI.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, a reduced investor for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
After several actions by the U.S. government, AI has made this remark, he also said that the U.S. lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: it aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget will give a great start, looking at all other countries differently, so the U.S. is far behind in this matter, and we are making efforts for the next success of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling the fund could double the likelihood that AI’s next big achievement will be in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Huton Miflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, is an investor in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's best AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that overtook the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was appointed to the position of executive in Microsoft Research and as president at Google's China Branch.
Lee outlined the technical qualifications of the previous U.S. government, including the robotic challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government to recognize the next visionary.
Lee pointed out that U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
“It’s not China removing academic leaders, it’s corporate,” Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university veterans to work on AI.
Lee said changes to the immigration policy could help the U.S. in its AI efforts.
"In my opinion, permission to do PhD in AI through green cards should be automatically obtained," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"China's National Natural Science Foundation provides financial grants to researchers from the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations in the same way that it provides funding to academic institutions, but the quality of teaching jobs in China is not very good," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next in which it talked about a $2 billion investment.
For NSF, this investment currently exceeds $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, a law was passed in the U.S. that the demand for the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, a task that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece, prompting Greece to ban its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor is named after its territory, which has two names for the same claim and is already part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments made a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it, saying the renaming of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of Slavic people.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and would boycott the campaign, raising doubts that a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed for the vote would be valid.
The question on the voting ballot would be written: “Do you give your approval for the agreement with Greece to be signed for NATO and EU membership?”
Supporters of the name change, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zev, say it is important for Macedonia to become members of bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for the young people in Macedonia, it will allow them to live freely in the EU’s umbrella-shadow because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
Although it is not legally insisted, most members of Parliament say they will act according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary elections were held in 2016, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent registered voters voting.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gojo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter who lives in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorika and son Dushko, went to Macedonia to vote for a change in the country's name, so that on September 30, 2018 in Stromica, Macedonia, the country's name would join NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, who lives in Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament and laying chairs in front of the tents put up by those who opposed the vote.
"We definitely want NATO and EU membership, but we want to get our heads high and join it, not through an agreement," Kavdarov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they don't want to give us membership in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can join other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration," he said.
Prime Minister Zev has said that getting NATO membership will give Macedonia a very important investment, with the unemployment rate above 20 per cent.
"In my opinion, too many votes will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO," Zev said after casting his vote.
He said that the "yes" result would "confirm our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia found that 30 to 43 percent of voters would vote in the required vote.
A second survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday found that 57 percent of people were planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent of the vote is needed to be successful.
If the vote fails, the policy of the Western government, which was formed in May last year, will be the first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score a goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling won a 2-0 victory over Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a midfield pass in the opening round.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he got three Brighton players to defend.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a defensive player before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton Keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went from his right side to the net.
“Aguero has some problems in his legs that he is upset about,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter.
"We talked 55, 60 minutes on their game.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky they scored at the same time."
But, it was because of the sterling that Sky Blues gained early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball beautifully from the left side of Leroy Sen.
Sen touched a few touches before sending away the good Sterling.
Just before slipping from the game's hand, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League Group Play will now take place at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at Rhine-Necker-Arena in Sinsim, Germany.
He wants to play against the Rockies, but Shazam wants to beat him.
After the play-off controversy with the Nationals was over, there was no major reason for any other starters to insist.
But, the always-competitive Skagerr hopes that on Sunday they will score big against the Colorado Rockies, but the playoffs for the Rockies still remain just a possibility, winning the game played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got a wild-card spot by winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even though we're not playing very well, we can at least play to find out that the crowd and the other team that Denver has will probably be the highest-level game I'll face this year."
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals are still to be told about the starter for Sunday, but hearings are coming that Shazar could be included in such a situation.
Shasser, who played for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's Right Hander finished 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to Brett Kavanaugh about the situation around his Supreme Court.
"All the work we do will be on the right in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a very big election - I'm not involved in it, but really I'm involved in it, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
"You can take a look at this very, very terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now," Trump added.
Moreover, they are trying to seize power by using other necessary means, which you know is futile and useless.
To get power and control, they don't care who is sad, who is capable of it, they just want power and control, but we won't let that happen."
He said the Democrats' campaign was "contesting and obstructing."
"Moreover, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you've seen the anger of the Democrats and you've seen how mean and bad they are," he said.
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he referred to the name of Democratic senator Diane Feinstein, which was strongly praised by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you leaked the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for something - whose body language was really bad - that bad body language I saw for the first time."
Working is no longer a broad church.
For those who say what they think, it is not worth it.
When the activists who promoted my local party voted to elect me, it was a huge surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest among the Labour MPs whose importance has been reduced to a great deal – we cannot say all the things of our mind.
It happened here with my MP colleague Joan Ryan because he too had raised his voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, there were conflictingly similar problems in Europe on which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
For the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was said that “we wish that all things are included in the meeting and these are beneficial.”
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I saw most of it here that the Friday Night GC meeting was exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today there is no consensus and or promise that the politics of “compassionate and compassionate people” are actually forgotten, here too.
It is clear that if the Labour Party has different views, they are not tolerated and for every consideration a decision is made on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It all started right after Jeremy’s leadership, for which I had already thought he would have a political opinion like mine, and he began to expect me to turn away from what I said and work in positions that I could never agree on – whether it was about national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public — and it really doesn’t matter what I say — bad words are seen on social media, sharp comments are made, center politics are condemned and I’m told I’m not worthy of the Labour Party.
Plus, it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are about politics.
I know how businessmen work and I’m dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don’t shy away from raising voices.
In today's political era, there are many frustrating aspects, one of which is how to normalize the levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the Broad Church and every proposal of "disbelief" or the change in the party's selection rule has been greatly reduced.
Over the past two years, many people have given me advice and urged me to remain silent, not talk too much, and then I would be "right."
But I didn’t come to politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was involved in labor as a school student, I was instigated to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to quit my school’s broader classroom altogether, and I sought to provide better public services to those who needed them most — whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area of disagreement about my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that harms homes, businesses and our public services, I do not consider it necessary for the Labour Party to waste its time and energy in showing its honesty.
But, in reality, I have a message that's not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my supporters, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to be serving you and I promise that my work can't create any sort of selection risk or political campaign barrier. I'm just interested in all the things you're interested in.

IR 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable IR reach the top
The two late attempts may have had an impact on the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ir deserved a win in this great recreational match of Tennant's premiership.
Now they are just at the top of the table of ten unbeatable sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he found the best opportunities he could, which led him to take the home team forward and give coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We thoroughly checked our game and we're still undefeated, so it makes me happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose explained: "The credit goes to Ayre, who redeemed his opportunity as much as possible."
With Grant Anderson's effort on the 14th minute, Frazier Clemo had to face Iyer, but Rory Hughes of Scotland was given a yellow card for the game by the Warriors, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Bagen redeemed the very difficult effort.
With the help of penalty just before the half-time, Clemo extended the IR, scoring a goal and then trying to unite the match 17-5 for IR at the time of the break.
But Melrose remained better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was turned into a goal by Baggot, reducing Lewe's five points.
After that, Ruridih Knott suffered a serious injury that forced him to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game, Ir moved forward and tried through Stafford McDowell, which Clemo converted into a goal.
At the time, Iyer's captain Blair McPherson had received a yellow card, and after a lot of pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an effort to extra man Bruce Colvin, who failed to redeem him.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card from the penalty line-out to face Billa Ball's clitoris, McPherson hit the touch down, pushing Ir back.
Clemo changed it to a goal after Kelley Rowe assembled David Armstrong's box kick and sent Flanker Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home side, as they could have done when the game resumed.
The star of the game is still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Game star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to get into the hospitality industry, having recently revealed that he was selected to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack has been associated with Jarvis's famous BBC show, in which he writes and co-stars Greg Hemphyll, a long-time comedy partner.
The two have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it seems that they are planning what to do with Cairns after Craiglang.
Based on the official record list, he is the Director of AdriftMormon Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a source from a Scottish Sun pointed out that Kieran wanted to join a "beautiful restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way for the Pacific
Marines are patrolling extensively at the Naval Headquarters of La Paz.
Ocean-blue flags are being hoisted on government buildings.
The Navy base stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon has a slogan here: “We have rights over the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, the coastal region that lost to Chile in the horrific 19th-century landslide, is still desperate to get its land – they want to hoist their flag in the Pacific once again.
He now hopes that he will be able to reclaim his Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a judge of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia is now full of enthusiasm, there is a sense of unity and peace, and the hopes of the people of Bolivia are about to yield a positive result,” said Roberto Calajila, a diplomat from Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the decision from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been in talks for decades - forcing Chile through negotiations to return Bolivia's land to the sea.
Bolivia's finest president, Evo Morales, who is set to face a contentious contest in next year's election, has also expressed positivity in Monday's rule.
"We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean," he said last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if the decision is in its interest, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to award the province of Chile, and it has decided that the possible outcomes of the talks will not be determined.
Chile's expert at the International Court of Justice, Paz Zerrett, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final talks, with what was heard indicating that the case was "not complicated."
In addition, apart from the conditions in Bolivia, for the past four years it seems that it may come back to the old condition again.
“The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia,” Jarrett said.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had eroded Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision is reached.
Ambassadors of the two countries have not lived in each other's country since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, who represents Bolivia in the Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually speedy.
He said Bolivia will have the "best opportunity" on Monday to "open up new ties with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Calazila has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was doing politics on the maritime problem.
“Bolivia will never back down for its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The decision is an opportunity to go about what we needed to do in the past.”
North Korea has said it will not stop nuclear testing unless it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his country will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it trusts Washington.
Ri made the speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit between the leaders of other countries in Singapore.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of North Korea's Kim Jong-un pledges in Singapore.
Ri said it was one of those "pipe dreams" that would lead North to a defeat by sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a significant disarmament campaign that is already underway without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump wish for another summit.
But, it is entirely skeptical that Pyongyang is serious about eliminating the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to jeopardize the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which is expected to be held by both Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of new-designed headwear for your nearest High Street.
If you have to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, you don't have to wait much longer.
Both Valentino and Tom Brown have created a series of superb headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that appeared at the famous Paris Fashion Week in a special style.
The best lucrative hats are made to avoid the heat of this year and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to the show.
The finest hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with wings-like wide brim hanging around the model's head.
The second accessory with a much larger side included a bezel-shaped waterlemon hat, a wizard hat, and a pineapple-designed hat - but they're not designed to protect your head from frost.
Tom Brown also showed specially designed masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colourful masks and saw things like Hannibal Lector more than the Haute Couture.
One creation saw all sorts of merchandise for scuba diving including snowballs and glasses, while the other creation saw a design with a melting ice cream cone.
Also, if you've seen a much bigger fashion - you're lucky.
Stylish-looking amateurs estimate that this great collection can soon reach the finest shops around you.
With a heel with a very large hat ‘La Bomba’ design, people from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski will be able to buy a two-foot-wide brim straw hat.
Behind the best effective hat was a clutch label that looked pretty, with a second creation catwalk posted on social media – showing a model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafia Fringing and had a white leather handle, it was one of the best attractions of Jacqueline's La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
"I hope the big hats and beach bags for the upcoming summer season will come to the shops soon - because the designers have been so impressed that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories,"" fashion celebrity Luke Armitage said in an email."
John Edwards: Must have language skills for citizens of foreign countries
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the best education track record, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver excellent exam results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), led by them, who are trying to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement school curriculum, we are seeing that schools continue to choose modern languages as alternatives to popular and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you talk to him in his own language, he's very fond of it."
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we feel that we can rely more on English.
In the recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages top the league table with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74-member schools showed that 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the skills they need in the future.
Languages are now being incorporated as an optional subject in the curriculum of private schools and other subjects like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled a lot to recruit employees for vacant positions, with 17 percent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative for young people to have more and more language skills to prepare them for their future careers.
Because of the high potential employment opportunities that require language, these skills are essential to work anywhere in the world.
No matter what career choice, if people have learned a second language, then such skills will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, being a multilingual person will automatically lead you to the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK took part in the YouGov survey, which found that 75 percent of people could not speak enough of a foreign language, and that only French was the only language spoken by 15 percent, reaching a double-digit percentage.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching language to children today.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding the perfect job.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in learning any language, they’ll always be able to choose that language in private schools and they’ll also find staff teaching it who are experts in the field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as “international communication skills.”
The choice of choosing this option, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland will continue to be given by private schools.
Good luck to the fairy.
The director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools is John Edward.
LeBron started his career as part of Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Now the wait for LeBron James fans is about to end as they are soon to play their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the season opener to play against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is yet to be decided how many minutes they will play.
"They will play at least one minute and at most 48 minutes," Lakers said through the official website.
Mike Trudel, a correspondent for Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to be ready for a preseason game."
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump held a lot of rallies for the campaign tonight.
Next week, Trump has set five more rallies that include Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other friendly destinations.
With a moratorium on the vote set in his election for the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming mid-term election as Republicans run the risk of being out of Congress's control at the time of counting votes in November.
When will Trump's rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
The timing of Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for Saturday night, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh may deliver a speech at this week's hearing, with the confirmation of the Senate vote expected for a week during the FIT probe over allegations of sexual offences against Kavanaugh.
But the main goal of the rally is to help the Republicans face the November elections.
According to Reuters, thus, President Trump stated during the campaign, "The five rallies next week aim to energize volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and enhance their stalled majority in the Senate and House of Representatives."
According to Reuters, the spokesperson who was removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit the states where the campaign season will be very busy."
“As scheduled in the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, tonight’s rally could bring the attention of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward in an effort to help candidate Patrick Morris, who lags behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate survey.
“If the president has to make an effort to give Morris a lead in the election, that’s not a good sign for him,” said West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haider, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show willingness to compete to maintain hopes of being at the top in the Sunday Singles
After three unilateral sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give a result of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The passing cycle of time is an entirely new concept for players, but it can't be predicted in competitions such as when a player advances and which player to trust.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead of four now, so I think we have to increase our pace a bit,” said Jordan Spieth while walking the day.
Of course, Europe took advantage and went ahead with 12 points in the game by four points.
According to Spieth, the American feels that he has a few opportunities left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and both received three out of four points from their game.
Spieth is deadly for everyone from tea to green and is also the best in the game.
As the game progressed, people cheerfully applauded, showing enthusiasm, when they and Thomas moved down two more points after two, putting important puts to complete four all-square.
It was because of his put that his team came in the 15th position with the same scream, a sort of sort that tells you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
"You just have to play really well and take care that the win is yours," said Spieth.
That's what all the players who have been out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, there are only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are making a new history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different styled but better couples won four points in four and are at the forefront.
On Saturday afternoon "Mollywood" is the only couple who didn't shoot any bogies, but they stayed away from bogies until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning before nine o'clock.
Sunday's run and the way to get that run met this strong crowd and this strong crowd as if they were batting, and there's no player who could turn a possible European team's win into a loss, it seemed like Le Golf National's sunset would be earlier than Fleetwood or Molinary's.
The two are different in different ways.
However, the dignity of the Europeans has been talked about a long time ago.
Boba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, their pairing at the time was made with Alex Norren.
A bogey in front of nine Dougs and two doubles by Spaniards and Swedes holed up, never before had they reached here.
However, on Sunday there was no one who could help you reach your hole.
Foreball and foursome were great because the interactions between the pairings were great, he advised that they do not need to seek advice and are well-versed in how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead on the last day, but this four-day session also showed that the team USA has the potential to play a game that is skeptical, especially at Stateside.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
Europe will take advantage of this on the last day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead foreball and foursome match against the United States on Saturday.
The best pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took on Tiger Woods, who struggled with two wins to get their Milan ahead of Le Golf Nationals four points.
To avenge the loss of the trophy in Hazelton two years ago, Thomas Beyborn was dominated by a misfire of the American side at the European Side Morning Foreball, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed a lot of resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they couldn't avoid losing.
Jim Furrick's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy's win.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molinary made their debut with "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their opening four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the foreball, they again beat Woods and American Ruki Bryson Deshambu by 5 and 4 points.
Woods, who put himself ahead in two games on Saturday, has shown his best, but has now faced defeats 19 times in his 29 matches of foreball and foursome and seven matches of crying.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose returned to the fours with his partner Henrik Stanson and defeated world number one and three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, the Pleasant, Breezy day in the southwest of Paris had no break from Europe.
Leading players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set a benchmark for the Americans by winning two points.
He won the foreball 2-1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Potter and sent Paul and Rory McLeroy back 4-3 in the opening two holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team came back from a singles match with four points, although the way Furyck's side needed it was to draw everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack on Sunday after remaining second-best for two days is going to happen, as is the case with their old game.
North Korea says denuclearization is only one party that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations continued sanctions that depended on its distrust in the United States and showed no way for the country to stop inspecting nuclear bombs on its own under such circumstances.
Mr. Yong Ho said at the World Body's Annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had tried a number of ways that were linked to "critical goodwill ways," such as halting nuclear bomb and missile tests, demolishing the site of nuclear bomb testing, and promising not to pursue nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the US," he said.
"There will be no confidence for our national security without relying on the U.S. in any way and in situations like this there is no way we can initiate unilateral disarmament."
While Ree reiterated that North Korea’s complaints are about Washington’s “step-by-step” approach to disarmament, which will gradually benefit North Korea progressively, his statement makes it clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to only one side because Pyongyang has done so before.
At the first summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, Ree referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the time that Kim vowed to work towards "disarmament of the Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop producing its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to lift strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has first emphasised disarmament and increased the level of pressure on sanctions so that it can forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has also objected to the "declaration of an end to the war," Rei said.
"Restraints can tilt us, such an assumption is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that the constant ban is making us less confident.
Ri did not discuss the plan for the second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, adding that the U.S. leader spoke last week of the United Nations' capabilities.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and further stated: “If the party for this disarmament problem is South Korea and the US is not, disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a deadlock.”
Still, Ree's speech was very different from last year's speech when he spoke about the U.N. National Assembly saying it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rocket after Mr. Evil President Trump, who called the "Rocket Man" on the suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim's courage to take up disarmament but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmaments.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no timelines set for it, “if it takes two years, three years or even five years – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are debating whether Pyongyang should be rewarded for steps taken by the UN Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must remain in place until without fail we realize that we are fully, last and verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has extended sanctions on North Korea in 2006 with full consent to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ree at the UN General Assembly and then told him he would go back to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last tour has not been good.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said that the work had proceeded, within just a few hours North Korea condemned him for "gangster-like demands."
In a meeting this month, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site, and if the United States adopts "consistent measures," it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
He said that Kim had promised them "consistent measures" they were seeking guarantees of the Trump resolution in Singapore and they proceeded to build a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for a comfortable enough job
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get as much rest as possible while competing in a growing Macho culture for studies through caffeine-fueled "all-nighters."
A teacher who teaches the world's number one university students often has no choice when it comes to exactly what to do to relax themselves.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of less sleep during teaching, he came up with the idea to start this course.
He told The Telegraph, “I got a girl at the end of the year and she said: ‘Why do I say that every time I have to go to the next class next year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which shocked me.
On the first visit to this course this year, students will learn how good sleep habits are important in studies and athletic performance, besides it will also improve their general health.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Services, said students do not get enough sleep every week for which the university decided to start the course.
A series of interactive tasks has been included in the course that runs for hours.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to explain how caffeine and light will be affected and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
Professor Zessler said, “We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But, we believe that they should have information about this – just as information about the health effects of smoking.
He said the culture of feeling proud of ‘reading all night long’ still exists, with modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough and sleep well is like a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – it also protects them from the impact on weight because lack of sleep keeps their brain thinking about hunger, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler build the course, completing his last year's class at Harvard last year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated to take the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that it will be mandatory for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Jessler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before going to bed, as well as deciding when they should wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too much circadian rhythms on them, causing sleep problems.
Livingston vs Rangers 1 - 0: Menga scored against Gerrard
The Rangers faced trouble in another match due to Dolly Menga's strike, with Livingston's 1-0 victory responsibility cast on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
Ibro Side was looking for his first win after a 4-1 win in a match in St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team pushed Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games as manager to help Landbrooks Premiership's leader Hurts be knocked out by eight points.
Before the half-time, Menga went on strike for seven minutes and after that Rangers' line-up shorts didn't even get a chance to equalize the game.
However, the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place in the rankings, with Livingston reaching third and only behind Hybrid due to the goal difference.
In addition, since Linsman Calm Spence's head injury has been treated since the object was clearly thrown to the other end, the game could be even more troublesome for the Rangers.
The eight changes made to Gerrard's side gave the previous Irr a chance to enter the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point from the Hearts last week and the way they drilled nicely caused the opposition team trouble at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal for the first time late-off, he should have given him only two minutes, but the midfielder redeemed the big opportunity he had.
When Keegan Jacobs, who was in the deep, did a free-kick, the kick went to Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow, who was on the back post, could only widen the tab.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, they were more confident in their game than they expected.
Of course, Alfredo Morelos experienced that he should have imposed a penalty on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless collided with each other, but the referee Steven Thomson had rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers saved two shots at the target in the first-half, but former eyebrow goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties from Lasana Colibaly's header and Twi OV Azarya's strike.
However, in the 34th minute, Livi's openers could go against the run of the game, but no one can deny that he alone is entitled to the graft.
Even then, the best player in the Rangers Deep could not chase Jacob.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson calmed down to pick up Menga for a simple finish.
When Gerrard swapped the Colliebel for Ryan Kent and switched to show the effect immediately as soon as the Winger slotted in Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line by running nicely.
But, Livingstone showed the visitors the kind of game they could really enjoy, sweeping the long ball with Lithgow and Lightweight after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have extended his edge, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from studing well before Lithgow widened from the corner.
The Rangers called Glenn Middleton as an alternative, they made another late claim to the penalty as they got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't let them succeed again.
Elmanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Now a page of our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and later... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, Geyser invented a device later known as Geyser Counter.
Geyser is a staple of counter-science, it has become the staple of pop culture, as well as, in 1950 a film "Bells of Coronado" was made on it, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acting for the first time:

The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ the bad cells of the immune system
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ and eliminate the bad cells of the immune system
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify bad cells during treatment
With this method, the immune cells of a patient can be extracted and replaced in the lab.
After that, the common protein for many cancers from them can be ‘seen’ and then removed and replanted
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in different types of cancer patients.
A woman who was vaccinated looked at her weak cells in the immune system and found that her ovarian cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
This method can remove and replace a patient's immune cells in the lab, so they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then regenerate the cells.
“Our results show that this vaccine is very promising,” said Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof. Berzofsky said HER2 "develops many types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer.
Removing the immune cells of patients and "instructing" them to detect cancerous cells is beneficial in the treatment of a kind of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's finest performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would form his government in 2020, he condemned in the studio during Saturday's Night Live.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So, I talk to the Gore people many times and they say: “What’s the reason for you to like Trump, are they racist?”
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL began the show with the skit of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already investigating claims of sexual harassment made to him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing was shown, the footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not clear whether Rock was trying to make the West laugh with posting to the West because of the post.
At the same time, West complained in front of the audience that he was threatening to go backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me with backstage.
"""You don't go there wearing that hat,"" he said."
They threatened me!
He also said that I am stuck in the wrong place," the Washington Examiner said.
West said: “You want to see that wrong place?” At the same time, he said they would “make plays for my Superman Cape, because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you have the desire to move the world forward?
Love it."
In his comments he referred to the audience at least twice and the SNL artists felt embarrassed, in a separate report one person told the publication: “The entire studio went completely silent.”
The West was called in due to a delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, a few days before Ariana Grande's old boyfried rapper Mac Miller died.
West surprised many viewers by performing on the song I Love It, dressed like Periyar Botel.
West again met Candace Turner, head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, who tweeted: “For one of the most courageous people: Thank you for raising your voice for the public.”
But, the talk show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West Bus is right there "what she told and which is absolutely amazing."
“But, I didn’t choose anyone who would benefit (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their “art”) that I think is promoting the wrong idea for my community or calling my community wrong.”
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, at the same time, adding that he was now "formally going to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but before that Diddi and Puffy had done the same, which were the old names Puff Diddi and P Diddi respectively.
With him the rapper, the old name of the snoop dog was Snoop Lion, and the late famous prince of music had also changed his name to a symbol and after that the artist was already known as the Prince.

The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington raises questions about toxic mesothelioma
Kit Harington is best known for his fencing role as John Snow in HBO's Violent Middle-Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such roles on screen often inspires many young boys and they feel that such a difficult task is necessary to earn respect.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith explained that he was feeling "something is wrong" and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married her co-star of Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, she believes she feels "a lot of perseverance" in talking about the problem.
"""Personally, I feel strongly enough that right now - are we doing something wrong about mesothelioma?"
Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems that they see on screen?
Kit feels that television may have been partly responsible for the toxic mesquiteness, thanks to its much-hyped male lead character.
He further said: 'What happens and what is taught?
From what is taught on TV and in the street, young boys begin to believe that they must do certain things in order to be a man?
In my opinion, this has really become one of the big questions of our time - how can we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the minds of young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series comes back again at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, at the same time, he also said that he has done several programs with 'wargrounds and horse riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard's new series of True West, the story of a film producer whose brother is a bandit.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I got my spouse through this show, so I believe the show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here," he said.
Rose plays Yagret, the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS cases in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given the changes in recent times, most of the new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
China's health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of people infected with HIV had almost gone to zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex carried out by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that the LGBT community is quite discriminatory against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Because of many infections of the disease, these relationships have inadequate protection against sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised that they will be given access to HIV medication.
Maxine Waters denied that her employees leaked GOP Senator data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and "a way to conspire."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters described Saturday's allegations as unfortunate, saying one of her employees had posted three Republican U.S. senators' personal information on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were being investigated by Pandits and the website of the "ultra-right wing."
Waters tweeted: "Liars, lies and too much disgusting."
Reportedly, the information included the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and two Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information, seen online on Thursday, was posted by an unidentified man in Capitol Hill as the Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh was being questioned in connection with the leak of some information from the three senators.
Hill says that the IP address trick that identifies the source of the person who posted the address from a conservative site such as Gateway Pundit and RedState was reported to have been linked to the Waters office and an employee of Waters had released the information.
"This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false," Waters said.
"None of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security are being jeopardized due to these false and false allegations - was in any way responsible for the leak of this information."
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false."
Waters soon posted online to clear up criticism, including the former White House press secretary.
"The reason for this rejection is anger,"" Fletcher wrote."
"This shows that their nature is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not do so in anger.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They must be calm and patient."
It seemed that Fletcher Waters' response was comparing Judge Kavanaugh's condemnation of Democrats, with critics accusing Kavanaugh of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro also tweeted his thoughts on the issue of defeating Waters in the midterm elections.
He tweeted, "If that's true, it's a big deal."
In his statement, Waters pointed out that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and rules-enforcing units for these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told or not, and whether they will be held legally responsible for all the acts they have done that are very bad and dangerous to any and all of my employees," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson's act of espionage was not considered too powerful
The importance of Brexit is still traditionally seen in any new film from the British point of view, and it appears to be applied to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy Spoof franchise, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was renamed Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will we be self-sacrificing on the subject of how we certainly consider it nonsense to talk about the new export opportunity of the nation?
At any rate, the unqualified Johnny English, pop-oriented and rubber-faced, has a license to recreate baseless things - much more famous than anything else just in his name - is a comprehensive comic creation for areas where non-English speaking people live.
He is certainly a Daft Secret agent who managed to show Mr. Bean's Dash Cluso a little bit despite his bizarre pretense in Smoothie Glamour and is a dolope for the chap who contributed a single note to the Cherryette of the Fire Theme tune at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is basically a traveler and is the international man of mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclaycard TV ads was forgotten except for Wake's Chaos.
In this new JE outing, only one or two good scenes are seen.
I liked Johnny English enough to show me going to a helicopter wearing a armored medieval suit and wrapping a rotor blade on my helmet.
Having a physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but the laughter came short and seemed oddly half-complete, especially the "best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves with full confidence as a component of the comedy.
Laughter comes as if comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's peculiar misconceptions are not at all tolerable to me and I prefer Bean to Atkinson's silent film.
The thing that has always been relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The UK’s most secretive network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, with all of the UK’s working agent’s identities placed on the network affecting the agent’s work – a tragic incident for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and rather disturbing Prime Minister, who is already struggling with many political and unpopular problems: Emma Thompson can play the character of the Quasi-Teresa-May well, but the script isn’t too strong to work on the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that if every working spy has compromised, he will have to bring in someone who has already retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English would have to fight himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but he has to work away from the record on how an undercover operative should be: it has some good comic fiction, as well as, teaching English at a rock-type academy school by detectives.
The Englishman has been sent back to Emergency Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miller's replay role has been mixed up with his old-fashioned pained sideknob.
Now married, she is trying to become a submarine commander, her role is Jolly-Hockey-Sticks, in which Vicky Pepperdine is unable to cope.
So, in his Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin find some very big mistakes when they encounter the beautiful celebrity of Olga Cruelenko, the cracked Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger in the words of the Kerismatic tech billionaire who claims to have a solution to Britain’s computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta played the role of Jake Lacey.
English and Bog start their Odyssey of Fortial High-Jinx: They set fire to a French restaurant while working as waitress; they smuggle through the expensive boat of Volta; and English fully activates the Chaos of Realty when he tries to use the interior of Volta.
The film has definitely been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but still it’s fine and entertaining, there’s a lot of fun stuff for kids throughout the film.
of the middle class.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film I did not understand whether or not Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really fits his talent.
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the British people, but that the money will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a democratic plan that would require UK residents to work only four days a week — but get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's owners to give workers a portion of the savings from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution so that they can get an extra day's leave.
This will give the employee a three-day leave per week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources said such an idea would remain "beautiful" with the party's economic agenda and plan to benefit the country's workers.
The Trades Union Congress is promoting a four-day week shift so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party employee from The Sunday Times said: ‘The policy review, likely to be announced before the end of the year.
This is not going to happen overnight, it is expected to be a four-day work week which is in line with the party’s overall industrial strategy as well as the party’s vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers.
Being the Green Party that promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's labor conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he firmly intends to take back power from "faceless directors" and "beneficiaries" in utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire stake back as the Labour government can 'deduct' based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plan to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees in the company's boards and hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees, who can get an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Cavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican Senator withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pell asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if there was a possibility of the FBI detecting something that prompted them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked clearer than his South Carolina ally.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After that, when the allegation came out, I called them and asked, 'Did you do that?'
They were sure, determined, clear.
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be a stone's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh and that would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett denies it in a strong way," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And whatever name they gave him, he could not verify it.”
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring many highly influential stars to perform, and as influential as it is its mission; to end the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will not only bring tens of thousands of people to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also work to raise awareness of the true goal of the program of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international pro-global group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket for the program (except when you are not willing to pay a VIP ticket), “actions” must be completed to help those attending the concert become volunteers to create awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty, emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or in other meaningful ways.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the last 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is there just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people seem to be really making a difference by signing online petitions or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, with at least $10 billion already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that the Secured Fund has had a direct impact on approximately 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include the participation of The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and executive who is committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, "to help children grow to their full potential."
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
A frequently asked question on your website is "Why do you think we can erase extreme poverty?" in response to
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.”
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gennel Monai are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy for a "blockade" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Citing the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to curb Russian energy in the U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern part of Europe, Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go into the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively identical.
Referring to Russia as a "one-way pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "Economic options, more or less, in the case of Iran and Russia, are the benefits and replacement of fuel."
Statements are coming that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump who, according to him, has made Berlin a "ban" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity from 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stand was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-leading organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I am in big trouble when a large state interferes with our energy supply.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" her bid to run for the presidency in 2020, the senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Hollyok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes being a woman in the top position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting for the presidency."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh have been vocal in their criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to get an FBI investigation done before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, eighty percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the senator should not contest the election.
Thirty-two per cent voted in favour of contesting the elections in this way.
The survey showed more support in the case of contesting by former Governor Deol Patrick, where 38 percent supported a possible entry into the race and 48 percent were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to contest the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“Because of what my own son is feeling after coming back, I sympathize with other families who feel the impact of PTSD and know the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the “elephant in the room” and said of his son and other retired soldiers, “They come back with little change, they come back with hardness, they come back with the question of whether this honor is for him that his fellow soldiers and aircraft-pilots, and every other member of the army, have sacrificed for the country.”
A spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, said she was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims fleeing gangs or victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a court-friendly summary in Washington on Friday to support a refugee challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her colleagues "and the sons of members of her violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request to grant asylum on July 20.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence, creating a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed unorganised immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Resin, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international law of decades."
"Federal law expects that all asylum claims should be judged based on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an injunction violates that principle," said Justice-Mitra.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the policy denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to give shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear because of their caste, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group," the session said in its June 11 policy announcement.
The refuge was never meant to mitigate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled in the search for survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It sounds extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting the child suffering from a fever in the exit center of the city of Tehsil-Nahsal Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the dead bodies.
"Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their desolate homes, picking up the submerged goods, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude quake and the hospital sank.
Some injured people, including Dwayne Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated in the open outside due to frequent strong earthquake tremors.
His eyes were filled with tears as he felt the tremors of a violent earthquake in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silently.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threats" through "propaganda ads"
A week after China's U.S. ambassador to the U.S. launched a four-page advertisement, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the official Chinese newspaper in a U.S. daily accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to propagate.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register last Wednesday - after China accused it of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections - Iowa's highest-selling newspaper - which China denies.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, U.S. officials told Reuters there was a new phase in Washington’s campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them impose customs duties on each other’s imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs in the first trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, the major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In Sunday's Des Moines Register, Bransted wrote that China is now doubling that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press.
"In its propaganda, by offering paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstad wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will find limited unsatisfactory voices and no true reflection of the inconsistent opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrisome economic curve line," he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers abstained from offering excuses to publish his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are isolating female voters ahead of midterm elections with Cavanaugh's defeat, analysts warn
As the top Republicans are backing and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who faces numerous allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that they will see reactions, especially from women, during the upcoming medieval elections.
The emotions surrounding it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on the record that they want to move on with the vote.
Those things can't come back," Grant Reiher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
He said he suspects that pressure at the last minute by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither yesterday nor in November," said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to a Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with Cavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate hall shouted “November is coming!”, Mick reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to withdraw from the chart,” Stu Rothberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already overwhelming; it's true.
But it could be more, especially between female voters from suburbs and 18-to-29-year-old young voters who don't vote often when the president doesn't like it."
While detailing the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had already said that there is a possibility of protest if Republicans go ahead with confirmation.
“This has become a confusing mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or putting Cavanaugh on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they have treated them," Guy Cecil, director of the organization Priorities USA, who helped Democrats win the election, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in in view of the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, most of whom appeared to favor Cavanaugh.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony to be certain or potentially reliable, while 35 percent said they believed Cavanaugh to be certain or potentially.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Cavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as, at least, another fugitive, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanaugh had beaten her intoxicatingly at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee displayed her genitals when she joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet compared to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the Technology Legend, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to achieve "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete transformation, where all of their business models will end up completely overnight."
"We are not seeking permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vaughan: WW1 celebrates Victoria Cross Clark
The Church of England's only pastor who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the September 29, 1918 attack on Bellengize and Lehocourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and he never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his vessels at a parade held at Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "greatly symbolic" that the level was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion in the Canal de Saint-Quentin "amid a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
They later moved towards the firing line and, with "great valour," led the military-line and demolished three contingents before taking the field-gun hand alone.
On October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war, a German sniper was killed.
The 72-year-old Michael Vaughan said his grandfather's works "were something I know I can never equate to, but something we have a knack for."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also made the dedication after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and said "the heroism of a real hero is being demonstrated by the support being given by many."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch the Bellatrix 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine you were awake all night to watch the haunted Bellatrix 206, but were deprived of seeing the main event.
San Jose's bill had 13 contests, including six on the main card and was being broadcast live all night on UK Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Moussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the U.K. were stunned by the change in coverage to Peppa Pig.
There was a lot of disappointment after waking up early in the morning, especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, said, “This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"" Peppa the Pig, yes."
Scott Cocker, president of the Bellator company, said they are going to work on their schedule to engage the UK audience in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we'll probably find a solution," Cocker said.
"But then it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, their time on Monday.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of text movements when this change happened and they weren't all favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six - as we normally do - and when we tried to deliver something more to the fans, it just got a little bit more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disk: Tom Daly Feels 'Unhappy' In Case of Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he was plagued with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said she didn’t realize until she reached secondary school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
She also said she was less concerned about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a sociopath in Laverne’s first program, Daley said she felt “less” in herself than everyone else because “like boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
She said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling isolated, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also "special," she said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without any hassle and wanted to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said a man – from American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “I was surprised when he fell in love.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find an older person who went through the fluctuations of similar experiences at such a young age.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said his “whole outlook” had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have all been related to 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are a lot more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son’s name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not admit that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had London 2012 tickets — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't be sitting in the front row, Dad."
He said, "I held their hands while they were unable to breathe and held them until their breath stopped and they were dead. Then I went and assumed they were not invincible."
The following year, Dalí competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"All I knew was that was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the crowd of indigenous people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had been resonating with him during the preparations for the Olympics and which he still hears standing on his toes.
Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out-of-form from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to avoid it becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the 12th time in a record, Mickelson was kicked out of the game by captain Jim Furick for Saturday's football and foreplay.
Instead of becoming the center of attraction, as he has often remained for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day among cheerleaders and working in the hope of improving the weaknesses of his way of playing.
The 48-year-old, who never drives straight even at the peak of his career, has not been the ideal fit for the Tight Le Golf National course, where those who are not active for long periods are regularly punished with wrong shots.
And while the course is not that easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played alongside Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American players, who start with four points down in 12 singles matches, make a strong start, Mickelson's match could prove to be very important.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, patted my back and surrounded me in my arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is Hall of Fame and he has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing his two games.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way we thought and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has received 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, though Furic said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's presentable, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Byron knows that big gains may soon disappear.
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large edge in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side under the captaincy of Sev Ballesteros had taken a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, with the lowest margin, reached the bus finishing line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, we just got the win," said Bjorn, after seeing a 10-6 lead in the 2018 class from Friday 5-3 and tomorrow at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that it’s not over.
You'll pay the full price tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus is to maintain.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players from all over the world are standing on the other side.
Bjorn went on to explain how his players performed on the hard golf course: “I’ll never get over myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Personal performances will come tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out there in person, your potential as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message you need to convey to the players to show their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he also has to give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite-stage Jim Furrick would have been wishing for his players to personally perform better than what he did as a partner, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Before Europe faced defeats due to the "miracles in Medina" showing, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furik himself has been at both ends of those big final days of reversion."
"I remember every word of him," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on his last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you did in Medina.
When this speed is unilateral, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set up our line-up and got people involved in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do some more miracles tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-attack with Rory McClaro in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter are the other top half of the European order.
"I grouped them in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of his solo selections.
Germany's new warship has been halted again.
The new warships of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the period-affected Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Puffles," which is the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, a military spokesman was quoted as saying by The Zet newspaper.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubled issues after the delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back by the Navy in 2007 to be brought in as a replacement for the time-affected Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will feature an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that state-of-the-art warships - which could give Germany a chance to power a project abroad - will be timeless until the period of entry into service, Dai Zein commented.
The tragic F125 had made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery to a ship.
Very few people were aware of the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on war missions.
The software's shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half of the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The "Reinland-Puffles" of 7,000 tons is considered twice as heavy as the same class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
In light of recent warnings, the problem of new warships becoming particularly important is attaching to Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "deploying ships."
The official said the issue has become serious over time, as the old vessels were removed from use, but no replacement vessels were made available.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats.
New research being conducted in an estate in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how bats use natural landscapes in their hunt for food.
It is expected that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of flying unique mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust, will follow general and soprano pipestrails as well as brown-eared long-eared and dubten bats settled in Weston Ross' Inverway Gardens.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings reveals the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
A map and report of natural habitat will then be prepared for illustration on a detailed landscape-scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of natural-residential management functions such as the formation of grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the bases of birds and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and construction materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also become a threat.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey due to their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to point out flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect the bases of birds and sometimes save them.
The organization has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the three estates of Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect place for him.
"Here in the three we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand what they need to thrive.”
They emphasize the importance of checking bats before they are kept inside the property as it is possible that the destruction of the maternity base could inadvertently destroy 400 females and infants, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, satanize or harass them or destroy their bases.
Elizabeth Farrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we still don’t know how their populations are growing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims, while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "false news," saying people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus Forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Derry Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting claims, the 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name."
This is normal.
They want to be popular by taking my name, but that’s part of their job.
"I'm a happy person and all is well," the player said, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations he has made, according to Reuters, "suspicious invalid reporting in the field of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the players would "demand compensation for moral damage in the amount consistent with the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and a suite of casinos in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has been disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was mutual consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and also photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an agreement outside the court as she felt "shocked by revenge" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to terminate the agreement as she has been harassed since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer made a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'forever regret' losing a car maker
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "always regret" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnstone near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese carmaker said that border delays could have an impact on jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Bernstein plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“I believe that if the UK exits the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Burnstone.
Other UK carmakers have expressed apprehensions about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will work.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming from suppliers in both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry that could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s checkers plan for future ties with the EU “has been purely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border.”
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that, in my opinion, can enjoy not only the success at the moment, but also what is essential to achieving this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"Not only Toyota but there is evidence from other manufacturers that we should be able to continue to fully do what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Savalaris, who has worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is the convenor of the Union at the plant, said his members are highly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back again after bad times.
A government spokesman said: “We have forwarded an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be deferred "another week later" as Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh's struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election interference, the relationship between the Trump assistant and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will oust the deputy attorney general, and endangering Mueller’s freedom, the news has warmed Washington’s rumors market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiring up and removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "like" the removal of Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid confrontation by a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and the woman accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Cavanaugh's claims, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The date for this is not set, it could be this week, I can see that the look at all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court could be pushed forward another week."
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the dislike of TV reporters for their “potentiality,” though he said: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they’re gorgeous.”
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president," she said, noting the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The briefing will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a direct question to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do that and you have seen us doing that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to take the place of the press conference," he said.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated to reporters in the presence of a strange and unparalleled presence on several occasions, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU activists in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU employees working at Scotland's NHS expressing gratitude to the country and wishing them to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its degraded public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the interactions between the UK and the EU continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.”
But the UK government is also moving ahead with its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and beyond, bring together peers, valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christine Abercrombie, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury, Tennessee Mike Organ said.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reid said.
The trainers and medical personnel placed him on the stretcher and oxygenated Abercrombie on the sidelines before being taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aberdromby had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details are available on the type/limit of the injury so far" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he scored a total of five tackles on Saturday, making his season a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers when buying property in the UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged high stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This move will neutralize Corbyn's campaign success to attract young voters
Extended stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless
Preparations are underway to recover high stamp duty rates on buying property in the UK from foreign buyers - the extra cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, which attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting higher earners.
The stamp duty increase will be levied on non-taxpayers and firms in the UK, with additional funds boosting the government's campaign to deal with sleepers in adverse circumstances.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes the purchases of two houses and rentals that were started two years ago, can be up to a maximum of three per cent.
The treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly-built London properties are purchased by non-U.K. residents, leading to price hikes and making it difficult for first-time buyers to step on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" as there is a high number of such foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of taking land but not using it to raise property prices, and urged Ms. May to release quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "homelessness."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the end of "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Ms May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our disruptive housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not correct that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as it is for foreign-based companies to buy homes for hard-working British residents.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become a distant dream, and the fury of gold under odd circumstances is extremely real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "last ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in the league one, and which is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father from childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in managing the club," he said.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gauss Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic Boss says he felt no panic following established names in a big club that had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's initiative.
"At the moment, the success for me can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League?"
"Because of the structure and features of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful here if I can get the club there."
Having spent 15 months as Dumbarton's assistant boss and Hart's coaching staff, Ross' management career has only been three years.
He then helped Aloa recover from a third-tier downfall, and replaced St. Mirren with a rebound from the downfall of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers at Clyde, Heartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
In the case of Aloa taking charge, he said, "It was probably the real intersection."
"I really believed that the management was more perfect fit for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, earned the right from it, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to do a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but in terms of management everything seems to be fine.
I always wanted to manage and now that I’m doing it, it makes me feel most comfortable all my adult life.”

The correct time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the survey found
The summer heat has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The pub and bar group saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: “Continuous sunshine and July compared to England’s expected participation in the World Cup means that a similar pattern was followed last June when the pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that the restaurant faced even more difficulties.
Restaurant trade declined by 1.8 per cent in June and worsened in July.
Wine vendors pubs and bars performed the strongest with more likes than restaurants.
Food-powered pubs also suffered sun damage, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
All pubs and bars for the month saw a 6.6 per cent increase in sales of drinks, while food prices declined by three per cent
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: “These results have continued to drive the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events becomes the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-over-year, especially due to current cost pressure, would be painful.
The long summer season could not have been a bad time for the food and material operators and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the most urgent relief," he said.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-outs.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised apprehensions that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, "fake Insta" accounts grew exponentially - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised apprehensions that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clear “main” account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found that in it a teenage girl was urging others to "rape me."
Research from independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were accepted to have private accounts.
“It’s very disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them,” said Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Elidh Doyle will have a "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most embellished track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that bringing them to the board will bring a lot of benefits to athletics in Scotland," Betty said.
Doyle said: “I am eager to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the American, who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now who are regularly BBC pundits, became unable to walk after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a shock.
I can't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if I will be cured and to what extent I can be cured.
It was a terrible job, but learned to fully recover, to walk again, and to practice agility today!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Comparison of mothers to cows by breast pump advertising created differences in the opinion of people online.
A breast pump company split opinion online by an ad that compares lactating mothers to lactating cow's milk.
To mark the launch of a product called "World's First Silent Wearable Breast Bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired ad, in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance to a song in a barn full of cows’ grass that includes some of the lyrics: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t gnats, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Them Babys, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies.”
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from viewers, with many saying it portrays the "horror" of the dairy industry in a light-hearted way.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Just like us, they need to give birth to be pregnant and produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Obviously painful for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "How irrelevant advertising is."
Others defended the ad, one of which the woman said she found the song to be "comical."
"I think it's a very good idea.
I would have had it, too, if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me absolutely feel like a cow.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote, "It's a great product."
The second commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like “cows.”
It is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they kept dancing by carefully pumping into their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel as if they are a cow.
However, the Elvi pump is well hidden, has no wires or tubes and fits directly into a nursing bra carefully, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go out without pumping.
Ana Ballerina, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a blasted and spectacular launch.
By outlining the parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in an entertaining and relevant way, which will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time Elvi has been in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product was seen walking for designer Marta Jacuboski.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Secretly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The detained migrant children were spied on, even when there was no relative change in the monthly border crossings, in part because the harsh curfews and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hire children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had appointed undocumented immigrants and feared they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by claiming any children.
The threat escalated in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adult or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Matthew Albens, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, submitted evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor Sanghless minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Around 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
While demanding that the children be prepared quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that required the children to appear in court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the sheltered staff.
Many people appear through video conference calls rather than being personally presenting their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are considered unfit to be released are immediately fired.
The longer children remain incarcerated, the more likely they are to stay in their backchains or depressed, which may be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts, according to conservation workers and systems reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a higher facility like Tornillo, where the sign that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he said, taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to get emotionally ready or saying goodbye to friends would further exacerbate the shock they are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish forces to return immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulaym also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even when the country was now in its eighth year of war.
Moulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces illegally live on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated according to the same.”
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the battlefield," he told the assembly.
Moulam stressed that the "war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and several million have been displaced from their homes.
Damascus will continue to fight this "supernatural war until we both clear all Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and the "presence of a foreigner," he said.
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the country devastated by the war.
On the case of refugees, Moulam said the conditions were good for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading the fear of inaction," which prompted refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this withdrawal," he said.
"They were politicising a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any aid to rebuild until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the fortress of Idlib's last major uprising creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political negotiations, says United States politicians.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people lived.
However, Moulam said the agreement contained "clear deadlines" and hoped that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who would be "eliminated."
U.S. Representative Stafa di Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution to fix the path to Syria and elections.
Moulam placed certain conditions on the committee for the Syrian government's participation, saying the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win in the second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020, as long as many liberals or aristocrats are not expecting any impeachment and scandal to end their term prematurely.
Undoubtedly "This will be the most dramatic end to the national post ever!"
So far, there was no fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the number has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of more than 1.7 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Royal Maddow Show" ranked the highest by capturing 3.5 million viewers in cable ratings with major news broadcasts at night.

There was value in the disorganization of entertainment.
Absolutely, on TV and beyond, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unification of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged spectators could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it is beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself looking at a six-hour debate by a panel of experts, using the root cause of Woodward’s “Deep Background” for his book “Fier,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar bomber jacket by Nirmal Kaytham (“A Thick Clothes with Habits”) and the Washington Post said.
I'll never see Super Mario that way again.

In the run-up to the election, there was a flood of external money in the strong midfield.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, credited to the Congressional Reconstitution, which led to two office bearers running for the same seat.
That recently opened the front for the Democratic rape Connor Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in a second term race, Republican Cath Rothfuss, which currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, intertwining with the new 17th.
Maps or maps were re-created after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in January in the case of the old districts forging unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
In the new 17th race, an empty-handed battle between major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) touched the campaign's economy.
Lamb's name became widely known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March 18th Congressional District's special election.
For this reason, the seat was occupied by the Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits instigated the democrats a little more.
U.S. to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrawing
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing because of resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump held an enthusiastic meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Haider Nort, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement that officials of the state department on the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" had decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development, and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow that aggregation or mass as they did last year, seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to proceed and effectively end, considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference in a sign of importing administrative spaces at the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October.
And three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the administration as well as speak on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case could be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on possible resistance to Mr. Trump's justice, of which there is now enough evidence in public records.
At the same time, Mr Mueller reports that he changes the direction of his investigation if Mr Trump’s campaign colludes with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body when he prepares himself to go before voters again and perhaps before a jury of his colleagues.
That is, a lot if or if and I don't mean to suggest or suggest that Mr. Trump's collapse, nor his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed from the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop so many years of genocide.
The methodology of historical center points around such points of divisiveness and the involuntary march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, what will we do?
Rosenstein has been in this dilemma since this paper reported it last year, suggesting secretly keeping the president's record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was not accurate.
“If the recently requested Brett Kavanaugh’s F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair – or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite verifiable allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we react?”
And beyond that, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will remain until the long winter.
But I think we will not fail because of the lessons I have learned in Preg.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who had also occupied my embassy once before.

Graham Dornan's Rangers are optimistic even after the intense Vienna encounter
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, winning the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Thornton from appearing for the first time in a season up to an equal of 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers could use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good thing for us because Villarreal was good,” the 31-year-old said.
"We went ahead in the game with the belief that we could achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they get good results with the crowd behind us or the crowd in their last game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
"Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made in the club itself last year was definitely difficult but now this place has a good experience.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully, we can now leave our previous session behind and move forward and be successful," he said.

Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking to their family members about it.
More than half of the people across the country said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here’s where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare to take care of your family if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also suggest ways to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help you pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or negotiate, the professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider an attorney's right to inspect your finances.
You will select a reliable person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Write down the information in the plan so that you can be prepared.

A man shot several times in the air in a laphroaig.
A man was shot multiple times by air rifles while he was on his way home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Lafracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed and the death toll is expected to rise further after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city on Friday.
When the communication was closed, rescue officials were unable to get any information from the Dongala Regency, the northern region of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongla, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency on the beach in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The Regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, up from 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of the Dongla.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morovli on the opposite shores of maximum sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, Tsunami in Palu and Dongla has struck several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongla killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Dongla, killing nine people.
Indonesia seismically sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake hit 14 countries on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra on December 26, killing 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggered a 6.8 magnitude tsunami that blew up the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, which is the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the area on the island of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing dozens of villages to be destroyed and about 300 people killed in the tsunami that hit an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow water earthquake in AK hit the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and stampede as people remembered the devastation or devastation of the 2004 terrible earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings or buildings.
2018: Intense earthquakes on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok devastated everything, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern direction of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of former East Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin of Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she used to take a phone call from him.
According to the KTUU report, Palin was sent back to the Moot-Sue Pretrial facility and was also fined $500 in unsecured bonds.
The network's report said he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for the plea.
Palin faced three A-class criminals, where he could be fined up to one year and $250,000.
He is also charged under Class B offences with a one-day jail sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Court of Experienced Persons.
In January 2016, she was accused of obstructing domestic violence, reporting domestic violence and holding a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of experienced individuals after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD stemming in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
As the mortality rate increases in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck in central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact on social media were circulating.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered for the Beach Festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding rare death penalty for NYC attack suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a rare death sentence for Saifulo Saipov, a suspect in the terror attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment awarded in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly uses a home depot rental truck to attack pedestrians and cyclists on the way to the western direction highway in downtown Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov has “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” physically injured them, according to the report.
These two countries potentially impose the death penalty according to the court document.
A week after the attack, a federal Grand Jury hit Saipov with a whip for 22 charges, including eight murder charges to assist in racketeering, which are specifically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack needed "adequate planning and prior deliberations," explaining the way Saipov conducted it in a "detestable, brutal and evil" manner.
"Safulu has been injured and harmed by the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves Enlar DeKat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allergy, Hernán Feruki, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alojandro Pagunco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The trial over the previous death penalty case in New York's South District has been going on for a decade.
Mulazim Khalid Brain was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was awarded in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was in 1953, a married couple found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
John Rosenberg was executed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, did not experience any glancing or remorse for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said she told investigators that she liked everything she did.
Saipov told officials that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone as he met with the crime.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count offence.
David Patton, one of the federal public patrons representing Saipov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be made in-charge for Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz vowed to "gather an army of people" during the protests at the Tory conference.
The Eastern European leader asked politicians to "understand the weather" from Eurosceptics - as one of May's own MPs suggested he should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bonn told a march in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage was Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'out by now'.
But the challenges faced by Smt. May in addressing her highly divided rank have been underlined by Pro-Rimen Tory to add a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Premier is struggling to keep his checker's compromise plan on track during attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the European Union.
The allies insisted that she would try to make a deal with Brussels rather than backlash — and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bonn said that leaving would mean leaving the rally in Solihal, in which he wants to 'fuck the checkers'.
She suggested that Mr. Farage should become a partner and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussel.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingboro MP or MP said: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.'
Settling its opposition in the European Union, he said: 'We don't need to be subordinate to anyone to fight a World War.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bonn rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to remain is completely false.'
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkin also said in March: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our activists who actually encircle the streets and make us elected in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening."
In a focused message to Smt. In, he said: The Prime Minister retains his jobs when they do not break their promises.
Mr. Faraz said the leaders of the rally should be made ‘mahul-e-saaz’ if they betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes."
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let you run away by doing so.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of deceiving Brexit by understanding the environment.
“We are organising the army of the people of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and which does not rest until we become a free, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists pointed to the tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis pretends to have conversations about security issues from the party app when the conference opens.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have a fair IT system for Canada, a resistant border and borderless free trade in Ireland and all the technology.
"This is a complete swamp.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a "strict approach" to the president's operations
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat or Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren GOP, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in the prestigious Geoff DeHall State in November, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were speculating that they could take Trump's place in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hollyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate since Trump took office using the Town Hall format.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to join the presidential race.
Warren replied that now is the time for “women to go and fix our broken government and include women first.”
The death of LSU Simms.
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Beton Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in footage.
Sim, 20, was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
Police chief Murphy G. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday that "he died after being shot in the head by Wade Sims."
Wade proceeded to defend his friend and was hit by Simpson.
When Simpson was asked, he admitted to killing Wade Sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained by the Police Department of East Baton Disease Parish.
A 6 by 6-foot junior, who grew up in Baton disease, played 32 games with 10 starters in the previous season at the Sims and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team win over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtery Bottas is qualified to play a major role in the Louis Hamilton Mercedes team order race on Saturday.
From the poll, Bottas made a good start and dropped Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vatel to create a barrier to his team's drivers.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton in traffic behind the pack, something that must be decisive.
Mercedes was a lap behind and came out of the back of the Vettel but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly leave without risk after a double-move while defending at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh on the way to the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
Then he proceeded to a large part of the race, where he focused on changing his tires and quickly overcame Kimi Raccoonen in the fourth place.
He finally came to Pitts on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, when Rekonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtery did a great job throughout the weekend and is a truly great gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly by getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad attitude.
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Saturday made a false allegation to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While speaking at a rally in Western Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying people are "meaningful and bad and dishonest."
"A very good thing or thing that could happen in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do this.'"
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document — “Oh, oh, what?”
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't... we didn't," he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein declined to say it was leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she said it."
But the president did not find his rejection justified, who remarked at Saturday night's rally: "Let me tell you that it was really a very bad gesture."
He may not have done that, but I have hardly ever seen such a bad attitude.
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to withdraw power by any necessary means.
You see their meanness, dirt, as well as who they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to gain power or power or control," the mediator reported.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for Giant against Dundee
Dundee Stars won a 5-3 return game in Dundee on Saturday to compensate for Friday's loss to the Elite League against the Belfast Giant.
The Giant initially got a two-goal lead through the strikes from Patrick Dore and Francis Beauviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowne Dior brought home the level before the Giant's lead.
François Boschard equalised it for Dundee before Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen secured the win by two goals.
It was Adam Keyfe's third elite loss of the season for the men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With Giant winning the last three matches, it was the fourth meeting of the season on the Sides.
Dwayne's opener candle came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of McFall, with David Rutherford helping Beauville double the lead in the next four minutes.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before coming equal to Cooney at 15:16 of Matt Mercury.
Doer ensures that the giants take the lead in the first break until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The domestic side is regrouped and Boschard once again brings them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and ensured victory in his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who had lost their last five matches so far, are now scheduled to play in their next match on Friday at their homeland Milton Cannes.
The air traffic controller was killed to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the quake.
An Air Traffic Controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero or hero since he was killed in ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake on Friday triggered a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi.
The subsequent trauma in the area continued to devastate and many people were trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
But while his aides were fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Guanwan Eggang refused to leave his busy-controlled post at Mutiyara Sis Al Jufi Airport, Palu Airport.
He stayed there to make sure that Betic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower, when he thought it was about to fall.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtrett, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them from another city to a larger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached Palu.
"He broke my heart," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's destruction, with the agency saying access to dongla, Sigi and Botswana is limited.
"Death rates may still rise as many bodies may still be buried in debris or debris, or in many places where they cannot be reached," said Sutopo Nugheroho, the agency's spokesman.
The six-metre-high waves destroyed Palu, causing a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brought dead bodies.
It is rare to get clean water.
Everywhere, small markets were looted.
Jane Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia is running a race to help the Red Cross organisms, but we don't know what they'll get there."
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I'm asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
The first earthquake in Indonesia earlier this year occurred in Lombok, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nyuguni now reveals a man missing since the Laguna plane crash
The airline, which operates the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macronesia, now says a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely evacuated from the plane when it sank.
Air Nyugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the missed island airport, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday, officials said.
The airline said six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and how it happened are unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say the two aircraft did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane had not landed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jane said the plane had landed too low.
"That's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of deep water from an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the crew members were panicked and screaming and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working around to improve the ferry also helped defend using an airboat to bring people to shore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline over the past two decades but no one was involved in the air mission.
Analysts said the time of night when the woman was burnt alive
The prosecution on Saturday reinstated its case for retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rollett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she had used cellphone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulazim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones, which shows that the evening of his death was with Talis Chambers, refuting his previous claims, reported The Clarion-Lazar.
When the data shows that when she said she was with her friend Michelle Sanford, her cellphone was near the chambers at the time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented further evidence that he was not in the city that day.
Asked by the prosecutors if Tallis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “liesing because his truck was in Nashville.”
The second inconsistency was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Shortly after the Chamber's death, Tallis has removed all of the Chamber's text or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
Defendants are set to begin their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped to go to the jury for the trial on that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious or Aware Hip Hop?
Hip hop's trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling in positive messages in their music.
The High Breed from Bristol claimed that the hip-hop has strayed from its roots to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and re-energize the popular hip-hop.
Artists such as Fujis and Common saw a recent resurgence in Britain through artists such as Alaika and Loki.
The second black person?!
NY Nancy prosecutes couple after firing after texting "racist"
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased shooting after a mother complains that she is a “second black person” after making misleading texts.
The couple rejects that they are racists, prosecuting for "attraction."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expresses her bachelorette to Giselle Maurice, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, it sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, pointing out that her outgoing nanny who was African-American had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home in Uber after paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands the couple's dismissal and $350 per day compensation for six months, in a live-in gig she was hired to start work without a contract though.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do such a thing," he said, pointing out that "I know it's discrimination," he said in a post on Friday.
The couple said on the claims that they were racist, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was appropriate to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," the husband Joe Plasco told the post.
But can you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve ever insulted, even if it’s a mistake?
"Your new baby?
Let it go."
Like the lawsuit for "attraction," Plasco said his wife had only two months to have a baby and he was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you following someone?"
It's not fair to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal trial is still ongoing, there has been a quick response to the couple's accusations on social media, stifling them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear that the reader will not link it to their own thoughts and opinions, the new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: “It’s hard to think of putting oneself in place when reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It's amazing to know about the success of Pandington."
Referring to his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, he was optimistic about his rejection of work, saying he had both "happiness and gum" on the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of her family,” she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and was not arrogant at all," she said.
"But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you take pride in them, even if you're not actually doing it."
I think they've seen Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his imagination and creation, he always credited it to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pastor 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors went in vain.
"Nad was regularly saying that it was really bad, not expecting such a thing from him," said Mrs. Eden-Laparus.
"Then Nad called me and told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "I love you, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine given by the doctors to beat her heart was gradually ending up leaving her system.
He had died some time ago, and it had all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to scream, scream, or cry, because I was surrounded by my family members.
I had to take care of everyone."
Finally Mrs. Edenen-Laparos, who was sad to lose her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I put my head down and I was crying all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see a feeling of utmost sympathy for Nad in the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women victims to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones due to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages that people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 when he suffered from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always used to say that his smile could light up everywhere.
Though he had quit work before he died and he lived in a “very dark room.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who at the time was searching for his lost brother or sister at the age of 11, committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect.”
Ms. Davis made the card, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they're not friends."
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been Ms. Davis' friend for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we'll make some changes to his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he couldn't get his eyes on them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but she had to get out of it: "It ripped the family apart from inside."
It made us sad.
But we all had to go ahead and fight."

Kavanaugh's future was in shambles when the FBI began its investigation
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's been searching for - a limited time and limited scope investigation - maybe we could find a little bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday as well as fearing that the committee was "breaking down" amid the alleged partisan gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It was because of his lack of time.
The mid-term elections were just five weeks away, on November 6 – as expected, Republicans do very poorly, so they would be severely weakened in their efforts to win the land they wanted in the High Court.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the senator, preaches to support Mr. Kuwangowa, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear if Mr. Kuwangu could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, the vice president had to do by abolishing it and confirming it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'dead man' killed by Kim Jong-un
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea declined when John-Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Referring to the South's Unification Ministry, Park Bayong-Syoga said 1,127 people had left their duties last year as compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
A large number of fugitives from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Maximum fled to China, whose border with North Korea is the longest and easy to cross the reliably protected civilianized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their home countries by force.
The relationship between the North and the South - which are still technically in a state of war - has seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which focus on blocking nuclear disarmament talks.
It was activated after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they widely agreed on terms for working toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed US sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will first have no choice but to harm ourselves unilaterally," Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelori calls Brett Kavanaugh "fun," saying she is not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "fun" and said he was ineligible by nature to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't imagine a woman doing such a demonstration, they call it "fun," Pelosi said in his response to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes yelling and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He categorically penalized the Democrats on the committee by falsifying the allegations of "bizarre and coordinated character manipulation" by liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he felt that Kavanaugh's witnesses had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was acting against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted that if asked, if Kavanaugh would become permanent and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, he would still blame Kavanaugh.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not fair to the Supreme Court, but being invited can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rules against the Act or Roe v. Wade's costly care, as she is known to do conservative justice.
In the interest of its authentication, Kavanaugh adjourned the questions as to whether it would reverse certain judgments of the Supreme Court.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions on whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's judgments.
And women need to shake it up.
It's a religious insult, months and years of anger emanate and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stemin told me 45 years later that "we get angry when we cry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, “A woman helped me a lot with the work of an officer somewhere, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technology, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you feel that I’m sad because I’m crying.’”
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An early job, one of my sharpest memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, I found an old woman holding my neck from behind—a sharp manager I’d always been a little scared of—that dragged me down the stairs.
"Never cry in front of anyone," he said.
"They don't know how strong you are.
They think you're depressed and you'll be happy to meet them."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Monkey Business making a relationship with someone other than marriage and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was highly disappointed, decided to take part in the presidential race herself.
"It wasn't a thought-provoking decision," she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was delayed, she didn’t have time to raise money and so she swore she wouldn’t participate in the race until she collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she was surprised.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she could not overcome the emotions - thanks to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and frustration and anger from even targeted voters instead of representatives - she choked on sexism.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous break down," Ms. Schroder recalled how the press would have reacted about them.
"You might have thought that Clenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samadhi?
"Did he cry?"""
How U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial years of a trade war between the US and China were about to slow down and while the war is still far from over, the rifts between countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was issued earlier this year by imposing major sugar export taxes, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
With new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), the most significant increase this week is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated in its own way each time, with the most recent five to 10 percent slapping tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to blink soon.
Getting back to Washington means hollowing out the demands, but publicly bowing down to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing could move on, with the U.S. trade war positively supporting China positively over the long term while reducing interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that an accelerated political decision in Washington or Beijing could create situations that either trigger economic tailspins in the country is even more dangerous than what was actually seen by the audience before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for New America Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year-long war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawlam said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe due to the progress made against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.

American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at Cross 3 16th Hole by accepting a match from Francesco Molinary.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds by becoming one of the 4 players to score a 5-0-0 since starting the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbzon Oleson, the lowest-ranked European team player.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Dunson lost 2 and 1 to England's Lan Polter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the eight Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.

It was a difficult year.

U.S. captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We have defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee of America and move forward with Thomson.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You should salute them.
We played better."
