Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in EU/EU countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a rapid surge in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the group of unidentified epidemiologists reported pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% have an overview of a severe disease requiring serious care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical expansion of COVID-19 and currently the activity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world exceeded this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and that date.
Achieving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, the National and Regional Health Authority of the WHO and each country in the world reported COVID-19 cases are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the proliferation of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases for 14 days taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country up to 8:00 AM on 15th March 2020 as compared to Italy for the period of 31st January - 15th March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
A 14-day brief cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and throughout the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and increased rapidly around February 28, 2020.
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the same growing trend was seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases compared to Italy in EU/EEA countries and the UK in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This particularly reflects that as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of cases comparable to cases in Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace across all countries.
This is despite variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients in countries that need to be checked for confirming COVID-19, including catching and screening.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The data of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases and/or intensive care unit are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (the figures are not shown).
They should, however, be collected methodically to supplement the current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010-11 study found a large difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The proliferation of 90% risk-related hospitalization COVID-19 cases with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Acute Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far persisted in flocks in EU/EEA countries and in certain areas of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve the defined regional public, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the continuing community transmission status of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC's Acute Risk Assessment, with the change of approach to mitigate limiting to mitigate, a faster, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if not implemented in a timely manner, it may be that the expected rapid increase in the number of cases does not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, adapt and adapt their response accordingly.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
To slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, countries have very few opportunities to further increase their control efforts and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, it is very likely that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a sharp increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Like its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and produce similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older people and men than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review on a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, epidemiology, epidemiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope this review will help in understanding and eliminating the deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay at home for the entire holiday and several weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the outbreak of ultra-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to the whole country and about 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital due to the virus and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and likely more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, for-science, diagnosis, and treatment, setting the sequence of the virus apart from many patients.
This review attempts to summarize research progress on a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and forecasting of the disease as well as some of the more urgent questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, with mainly generating about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the original outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible unhappiness and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the herd of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, was first reported from Wuhan to the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoV was released.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
During this time, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, health care providers reported an infection, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down with all of its public transport shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly escalating, the final prevalence and intensity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
The multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 presented a more up-to-date portrayal of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very little less than 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more infected than women (0.27/100,000) with SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 has spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to widespread traffic in China before the Spring Festival.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and recurring viruses with a single thread of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The cover nozzle (S) binds to the glycoproteins, its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then merges the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellular fluid; after the replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms genomic RNA virion-containing follicles with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then merge into the plasma membrane for the release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 indexed samples collected from the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Transmission by electron microscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 particle was found in ultra-moon segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be receptive to SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S protein is associated with human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infections than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2, coded by orf3b, can also produce novel short proteins and secreted proteins coded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and block the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in mixture with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary and intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted by civet cats and camels in humans, respectively.
By racial comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate host has helped infect humans by crossing the virus species barrier is unknown and the transmission pathway is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the virus in humans from bats that included a similar recombination with S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolin - often used in traditional Chinese medicine as a long muzzle, ant-eating mammal - is a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and CoV found in pangolin.
However, the spread of the difference of 1% across the entire two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV synthetic can survive for 48 hours and less than 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 5 days at 40%-50% humidity in the ambient dry environment.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes and is sensitive to ultraviolet rays; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracetamol, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus has penetrated into the nutrient, it is the first time that a C-type lectin-like receptor, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) have been identified by the endocrine receptors (PRRs) from the endocrine system.
By various routes, the expression of virus inflammatory factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferon (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, an adapted immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T auxiliary cells produce inflammatory procytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Tridosynthesis, including supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, the antibodies isolated from the recovered patient inactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and even multi-organ failure and death in the worst cases.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the onset of the herd, is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a higher number of viruses or whose immune functions are combined are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on the first 425 case studies in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases observed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing the virus from infecting but asymptomatic people from transmitting to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus usually require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced breathing difficulties and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and coglopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and without pulmonary depiction abnormalities should also be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 observed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing difficulties and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Two recent studies of herds generated by transmission from family herds and asymptomatic individuals reported similar findings.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study observed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiratory distress (55%) as the main symptom.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them needed ventilation support and this is in line with the higher fatality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
It has been observed in SARS patients that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
The COVID-19 case fatality rate was 2% as of February 14, when the confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
By comparison, the death rate of SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate based on the June 2012 demographic study was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2's spread potential is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A herd often begins with a single family or a single group of people or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected individuals or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovering patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, which warns of an increase in quarantine time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphatic cells) in patients is normal or low at an early stage.
For example, lymphatic cell count, including 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, white blood cell count, lymphopenia with 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood of most patients increased.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin collapse present in the blood, levels of D-dimers, had increased and the lymphatic cell count continued to decline.
Most COVID-19 patients find abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by bilateral spotted images or ground glass ambiguity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, the gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, material accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces the level of surface tension and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to bloat and increases the risk of the lungs to stop working.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often remain parallel to the most severe condition of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, in the first disease-diagnostic analysis on COVID-19, the vishalkan of pneumocytes in the lungs of a patient who died of disease, the formation of haelin membranes and porous leakage of lymph cells, and the polymorphic multicenter cells were observed which were similar to the pathology of viral infection and SARS and were consistent with the disease of SARS and ARDS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations in China began to be used for diagnosis on 13 February 2020 (which was no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which is 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L detection without the need for any detailed equipment, using a dipstick. 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L detection volume of SARS- 10-100 copies per microliter (input).
If verified in clinical samples, the hope is that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, doctors can provide supportive care primarily to COVID-19 patients with previously used or proposed different therapies for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharma companies are struggling to develop anti-virus and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 initially invades mainly the lungs and possibly also other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Still, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives and it includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and penetrative mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal brain oxygenation (ECMO), a modified heart-pulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs, is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of an excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These stimulate immune cells to release a large number of cytokine-free radicals that are the leading causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinin storm include changes in T cell-directed immune response; blockage of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; Blinatomab; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immune suppressant, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects while dramatically affecting the disease-diagnosis, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term procedures of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses have been recommended to be used cautiously in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given in the vein, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed possible inhibition of other irreversible RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to conduct two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
Also, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combined therapy with iopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other drugs used in patients of these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immune production from recovered patients.
There has been a long history of blood collection from patients recovering from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from suffering from the disease.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a higher level of immunity relative to the pathogen.
Immunities produced by B lymph cells to fight pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and inactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with low inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are required to propose to use the method on a large scale.
At the same time, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the harms associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening poisoning.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies so rapidly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells from the recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes effective antibodies or examine the effective antibodies to the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in a different formula depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or meaningless because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie-do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 in many provinces of China, while Hubei Province, where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly thick comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western medicine (WM) treatments and combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature in the WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly shorter than in the WM group alone, the time required to normalize, go away symptoms, and hospitalization.
The most influential, the symptomatic worsening rate of the WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly lower (lightly severe) than the only WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the only WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
Still, more well-researched trials are still await for the effectiveness and safety of TCM at larger scale and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a lot of fear from highly contagious and deadly disease and those who are quarantined also experience monotony, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, low-oxygenation and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more discomfort and mental agony.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including persistent stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide.
Finding mandatory contacts and quarantines as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more restless and gloomy about the effects of stigma on contagion, quarantine and their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons who have come into contact with them as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other with continuous and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting the link of transmission from animal cells and infected humans to sensitive hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of the epidemic due to growing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivating immune and/or defensive immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-adapted vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS.
However, the efficacy and safety of these candidate vaccines in older people and in fatally challenging models is still to be determined before the start of any clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS gradually ceased to exist 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
Conversely, sporadic cases and herds of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in epidemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using subunits of passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an essential and important task for controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the long-term need (average 18 months) in vaccine development and difficulty due to the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As the new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without the symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create a disease-diagnostic paradigm to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on yet-to-be-informed clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to the disease-diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the disease-diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
The study of 8,866 cases of COVID-19 mainly occurred in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of the patients were over the age of 50 years, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and complications and those who did not require them were significantly older than they were (on average age 51 vs 66), indicating age as a predictive factor of the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to ACE2-positive collagenocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have a deep correlation and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a possible predictive factor in response to the disease, therapy, and ultimately recovery.
Correlation of CRP levels with severity and disease-diagnosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
At the same time, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: The topical progress of chest radiography and clinical symptoms along with other problems should be considered for the outcomes of COVID-19 and foreseeing complications.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as convective therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, the steroid should be used in low doses and in COVID-19 patients for a short period of time.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is vital to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people get out of stress and get back to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, there are epidemiological features distinct from the SARS of COVID-19.
Along with replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection like other CoVs that cause a cold.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of the virus during daily activities in the early stage or incubation period, with too much difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmissions did not occur during the initial stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
With the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, there are currently huge efforts underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other regions of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a downward spiral of the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the ups and downs phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set a pattern to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both the mid-turbinate and throat pharynx of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the identified new virus, like influenza, could become a recurring case.
However, there have been promising signals from China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to be one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in infectivity and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
Comparisons of the COVID-19 pandemic to SARS and MERS are given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with contaminated materials from the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health care providers, were likely caused by hospitalized infections.
Therefore, great caution should also be taken to protect people standing next to humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgery facial masks prevent fluid drops from going into the air from a potentially infected person or sticking to the surface of things from where they can go to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23>1860s) masks can prevent small virions as small as 10 to 80 nm from inhaling; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed one above the other, health care providers with direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 (Series <0x23>1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is strongly suggested that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine, and possibly limit contact with infected individuals.
Three feet of distance is considered appropriate for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus for the human world, as reported on January 7, 2020, due to its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV, it may have made China extremely cautious based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control consoled the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited fertility and has no problem preventing and limiting the disease.
This message made the public quite fear-free, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the fragile time to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be quite careful when making (1) public announcements because every word matters to citizens and can change their outlook and decision; (2) should be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from doctors or authorities; (3) should be more aware of the system and more aware of the public's concerns about the effectiveness of the system and the practice of increasing the number of pandemics, rather than trying to console the public; and should be more restrictive to limit the potential epidemics at an early stage.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world by the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has made sense of the repeated occurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects more men than older people and women than young people, and the severity and mortality rate in the elderly is also higher than in young people.
The death rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless, while SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which creates a lot more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be re-positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases remain to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs was found, we still cannot come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species in transmitting the virus from bats to humans?
Without finding the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively stop broadcasting and the outbreak can ever recur.
Although molecular imaging and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and then cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressed cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end slowly like SARS, or continue to occur periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the price has to be paid, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal origins of human coronaviruses
Due to mutation and adaptation, coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts (including humans) have evolved together over a period of thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the destructive and lethal nature of the HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to light and shocked us by its more infectious capacity than its sister SARS-CoV but reduced pathogenicity.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and it will be useful for us to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which they are non- pathogenic.
There is also information about the intermediate cell receptors of some HCoVs.
The prevention of human diseases has direct implications for the identification of animal hosts.
Testing the interactions of CoV receptors in animals can also give important insights on the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current information about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of the discovery as well as the zoonotic origin and interracial transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the point of view of the gradual development of viruses and gene recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully change the hosts and the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the coronavirus family, which includes groups of invaded, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses sheltering the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses were named "CoVs" due to the crown-like morphology beneath the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unbroken genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicates polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins including spike (S), involuntary (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many genealogical-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different genealogies of CoVs.
Based on variations in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Ethnographic evidence has shown that bats and mice are mostly gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major clusters of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently surpassed species barriers and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperpulmonary manifestations in relatively more patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections are highly pathogenic.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was isolated from the nasal flow of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information was collected by detailed studies about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that the infection of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003, infecting more than 8,000 people with a fatality rate of about 10%, is one of the most devastating in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak generated a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause agent of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have an animal origin from bats, rats or domestic animals.
Numerous evidence supports the gradual development from bats of all HCoVs, including viruses that are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show extreme genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history of species jumping, motivational strength and bonding factors.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of cod, intermediate and enlarged animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 with significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, interracial transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Specifically, we highlight and discuss the common theme that ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural cell hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission into the new host.
We will also review the trend of gradual development of HCoVs with an increase in infectivity often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this perspective.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E breed isolated from the nasal flow of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from many infected animals, including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decade.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of HCoV discovery (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of colds including headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat with fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the sequential pathway in the brain of the milk-drinking mice and from organ enhancement.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those generated by HCoV-229E which are symbolically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and are likely to be majorly transmitted during the winter with temperate weather.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2-week illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, a mild cold developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with an immunosuppressive disability show a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," was the first well-documented HCoV epidemic in human history, and the third HCoV, discovered, is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS could be identified in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
With the spread of the SARS epidemic in many countries and continents, there have been 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the most spreaders, it was estimated that with a gradual development period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral bearing appearing on the 10th day of the disease, each case could increase by about two secondary cases.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle soreness, headache, fever, restlessness, and colds, followed by breathing difficulties, cough and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, neurotic liver function checks and increased creatine kinase are common abnormalities associated with SARS lab.
Circulating aerobic damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophage are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation later on.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, usually the gastrointestinal tract along with cytokine storms, many organs, including the liver and kidneys, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be fatal, especially for patients with an immune disability.
The virus was first isolated from the patient's relative to an open lung biopsy that traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found to spread to young children, the elderly and immune-disabled patients with respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are common in the appearance of colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis.
In the second independent study, the same virus was isolated from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its peak occurrence occurs during the early summer, spring and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive larynx-inflammation, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis found in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be related to severe asthma outbreaks.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these HCoVs, from all four communities, have been well adapted to humans and are less likely to mutate to cause usually highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves in humans, they become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary prevalence in close relatives have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in 2015 in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, correspond to SARS.
Unlike SARS, acute renal failure also develops in many patients with MERS, which has so far been observed only in MERS in patients with HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of 2019, a herd of pneumonia patients related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as an international public health emergency and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 produces severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing in the form of fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly increase in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of the caste lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
Symptom-free patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to the other six HCoVs and looking at the odds has shown very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the pathogenicity period of HCoV disease and the duration of the process are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics that are usually seen during the infection of the HCoVs obtained from the community, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also features both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectivity of the community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV progress in humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces samples.
Whether rectal-mouth transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some conditions, such as SARS-CoV, is yet to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonally like cases of HCoVs obtained from the community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectivity, pathogenesis, and persistence after it has gone into humans, will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The HCoVs obtained from all four communities that produce mild symptoms have been well adapted in humans.
From the second point of view, it may also be correct that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemics.
The HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and the humans that develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do this, the accumulation of adapted mutations preventing nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans in a sufficient range.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it will become fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitted to the human population, creating a cold in immune-disabled patients.
These viruses do not require animal feed.
Conversely, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and spread in their zoonotic cell and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing hosts.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least at the present time it is very contagious like the HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs obtained from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any coyotes or intermediate animal hosts.
Before we discuss the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be of great use to discuss the gradual development of HCoVs, the definitions and characteristics of natural, cellular, intermediate and enhanced hosts.
An animal is a gradual-developing host of HCoVs if it shelters a very close ancestor with high similarity sharing at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus in this nutrient is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic.
In the same way, coyotes provide shelter to HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both situations, the fetuses become infected naturally and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate host just before or around the time it enters humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as an animal source of human infection and play the role of an enhanced nutrient by temporarily replicating the virus and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of human infection.
If an HCoV cannot keep its transmission within the intermediate host, it can go into an end-infection.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to the intermediate host and maintain long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural cell nutrient.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS case indicator had a history of contact with sporting animals.
Later seroprevalence tests indicated that there was a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV-IgG in animal traders than in the general population.
In live animal markets, the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all sewage from the markets was killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm sewage in the wild or farms that are not in contact with live animal markets was SARS-CoV negative, which suggests that masked palm sewage may only be as severe as the intermediate enhancer nutrient and not as a natural cell of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou's markets are SARS-CoV-resistant, it cannot be ruled out that many species of small mammals may also be intermediate enhancers of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of SARS-CoV's natural animal feeder revealed a very close bat CoV named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshook bats.
These bats are positive towards anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS, such as CoVs (SL-CoVs), have also been identified in bats but no one other than WIV1 has been isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin mutant enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from specimens of bat faeces was demonstrated to use bats, sewage and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients recovering was able to deactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarities.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest cell hosts to SARS-CoV.
Racial analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus penetration.
The RNA-based polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are close to bat beta-CoV equivalents identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no surviving MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only an 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest cell host to MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have observed that camels with hump like camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries are seropositive towards MERS-CoV-specific passive antibodies.
The MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal branches of humpback camels, indicating that camels are the authentic cell hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV generally exhibited mild symptoms but very high clearance of the virus.
Notably, infected camels remove viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the faecal-headed pathway, which is also the main pathway for the removal of the virus from bats.
However, the questions are still present because there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of the symptoms of many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or any unknown transmission routes including species of animals sheltering MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity from bats isolated from bats associated with rhinolophus species.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine the ancestral relationship.
That is, bats may not be the closest covid host to SARS-CoV-2, unless in the future almost identical bat CoVs are found.
Possibly, the intermediate animal feeder of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of Hunan seafood that was associated with several early cases of COVID-19, indicating a potential human transmission event from animals.
Based on metagenomic sequencing, several recent studies have suggested that even a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolin (Manis Jawanika) can shelter ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with the CoV genome SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are among the two sub-generations of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the racial lineage, one of which shares a more uniform receptor binding area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
Conversely, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse despite gene-wide greater sequence similarity.
The earlier study of sick pangolins also reported a group of overlapping viral DNA from lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different convergent methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence containing a full-length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related beta-CoVs.
At the same time, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also lower than that of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path of gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
While the highest sequence similarity in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin has been found, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the extreme similarity between pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergent gradual evolution.
An alternative proposal is in favour of the recombination of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of gradual development, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Ethnographic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bats, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that the bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Applachain Ridge CoV) found in the three-colored bats of North America was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although the chemid is also its suspected intermediate host.
For clarity, a summary of current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnographic analysis has provided evidence of interracial transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of interracial transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alfa-CoVs have been found close to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-CoV.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans and not alpacas have been exposed to bats in shared ecological habitats.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas receive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bats are the gene pools of alpha-CoVs HCoV-229E, alpaca and humpback camels may be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interracial transmission in humans from bats to humped camels and humped camels.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its primary identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich plumage of virus species for interracial exchange and interracial transmission of genetic fragments.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interactions and excessive ability to fly are favorable conditions for all bats to be the ideal "virus transmitters."
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has penetrated the humpback camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted to these camels that have turned from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural cell nutrients.
MERS-CoV produces very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has a sporadic transmission accident in humans and humans remain the last host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
Specifically, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be the final host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs like sewage in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many of the possibilities of interracial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be accepted or denied in future studies.
First, bats can be cell-nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitat with bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancer receptors in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus has entered a new-found state.
Humans become infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of antibodies in domestic and wild animals are required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species with contact with both bats and pangolins.
The zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being discovered.
In addition to the variety of animal feeds, the three major factors in relation to the viral are also important in smoothly crossing the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-fiber RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of <0x7E>10-4 replacements per site 2 per year, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation in newborns.
CoVs contain proof-reading exoribonuclease, whose deletion can also lead to extreme variability and degradation or loss of life capacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir is considered to be suppressing the replication of CoV by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of their hosts.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, pointing to a higher level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another host closer to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoVs that have been well adapted to clogged camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic flow will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV puts additional plasticity on genome mutations and recombination, increasing the likelihood of interracial co-sequent development, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by abundantly unique open reading frames and encoded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs change the symbol randomly over and over again during RNA replication through the unique “copy-choice” procedure.
In nutrients that work as a mixture character, fiber changes occur most often during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely similar full-length and subgenomic RNA can recombine and generate new CoVs.
Ethnographic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of viruses in relation to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receiver is another important factor affecting interracial transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interracial transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the cutters between humans and sewage SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV with mutations on the RBD of S proteins in particular is considered to be rapidly adapting to different hosts.
Usually, the RBD in a CoV's S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected by the nutrient immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-recipients for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, seaweeds, rats and raccoons, leading to interracial transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in RBD separately from human and sewage viral isolation and 4 of them are located in receptor-binding parenthesis for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of Seat SARS-CoV consists of K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the interaction of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be important in the adaptation of the viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the bond similarity of its S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, the Cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attraction of this addition than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor will be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a separate part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors present, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silicic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal feeds.
The result of interracial transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to the cellular receptor.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and natural cell nutrients of HCoVs, such as bats, humpbacked camels and rodents, can hinder interspecies transmission.
For the successful inter-ethnic transmission of HCoVs, nutrient dependence factors have to be grasped and nutrient restriction factors have to be reversed.
In this regard, it remains to be identified and described the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-supporting interaction.
Using the latest technology of CRISPR, a non-partisan genome-wide examination of the nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors of SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful.
The emergence of novel HCoVs: a return to the original
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as the gene pool of CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoV and two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the novel protein-coding gene has the potential to alter viral epidemiological patterns a lot.
Among SARS-CoV-supporting proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to codify diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide extinction characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes the transformation of cells.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs genealogies, identifying a very large number of small recombination regions in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different genealogies, which occurred in humpbacked camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial elections can cause unintentional changes in the viral genome, possibly due to election-pressure-free viruses, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, leading to a frameshift.
Last but not least, the gradual development of novel HCoVs is also caused by the pressure of selection in their cell hosts.
Symptom-free or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs which indicates mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathogenesis generated by CoVs.
In addition, the inhibitory natural malignant cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the regulation of the natural malignant cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of key tissue conformity complex I molecules.
In addition, high levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) resulting from more metabolic activity of bats may suppress the replication of CoV and affect proof readings by exoribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when entering a new host.
More pathogenic CoV breeds may also be developed by recombination, which may lead to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or produce mild symptoms in cell receptors such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without showing a strong nutrient resistant response.
It hides secrets as to why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the immune response and hyperactivity of the cytokine storm, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the lung damage occurs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic conductors, the immune response is isolated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating the immune response can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon reaction is particularly rapid in bats.
Therefore, the administration of Type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, the NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is faulty.
From this logic, inhibition of NLRP3 influenza with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common theme that produced SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat Beta-CoV has seen 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While sewage and other animals have been seen in markets sheltering viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question persisted, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come into discussion due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of animal cells of HCoVs in zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the basic bats and are transmitted in humans by intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and sewage in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing sewage there should have effectively eliminated the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of several genes of beta-CoVs that are quite close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how in future investigations remains to be clarified.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has penetrated the humpback camels for several decades.
These camels are important means of traffic for the locals as well as major sources of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to discard all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene forms can emerge to generate outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in wild animals.
Specifically, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
It is very likely that these zoonotic CoVs will have a karmic development and recombination, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that may be more infectious and/or fatal in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in certain regions of China must be abandoned.
With the rigorous examination of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response planning should be done.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural cell until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that help in the spread of viruses, if people are educated about how to stay away from bats, the chances of humans contacting them and other wild species can be minimized.
To better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, constant monitoring of mammals is essential which will prove useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to keep humans away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of zoonotic viruses.
Many parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous investigations in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant impacts in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published the Quick Consultation Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides appropriate context for our experience and to fight this pandemic worldwide.
Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the ultra-acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China has issued a total of seven editions with fundamental changes in some contexts in the guidelines issued for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/).
Now that a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, they have introduced a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and gave valuable references to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Test Edition) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to confirm a suspected case, or three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemic history: (1) travel or residency history in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) School history of contact from infected SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases within the first 14 days (with positive nucleic acid test); (2) School history of contact with the onset of symptoms (with the onset of fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas), or other communities.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells indicates normal, reduced or reduced lymphocytes at an early stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed case should be based on a questionable case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence which is as follows: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the viral whole genome index is positive; (2) the incidence of incidence of incidence of incidence of incidence of incidence of incidence of novel coronaviruses; and (3) the specific incidence of IgM for SARS-CoV-2.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then to the seventh edition the serial proof was added.
These modifications were based on the ongoing work of researchers who explored samples from the respiratory system, including an optimal nucleic acid detection kit, as well as blood samples for quick diagnosis, thereby increasing the availability of various samples, and supporting to bring specific immune-positive results to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a number of evidence that reminds us to take precautions with unsympathetic symptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, since they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a result, we hope that more direct evidence will come out and invite readers to provide their comments.
To diagnose "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest locating and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update their guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new COVID-19 deaths in Bangladesh, highest single-day death toll so far
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest single-day death toll from the virus so far.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported so far.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora reported that four men and one woman have died.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two patients were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital official told a local news centre, Anadolu Agency, that the deceased was named Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission and was being cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Road Transport and Bridges Minister Ubaidul Qader said that road transport will remain closed for a longer period of time than planned until next Saturday.
The public transport ban began on March 26 and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities such as medical items, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The earliest cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three of them were cured.
More than a million cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide crossed one million.
COVID-19 has been linked to at least 52,000 deaths due to the virus.
The day the figure crossed, the first case of coronavirus infection was reported in Malawi and the first death from coronavirus in Zambia on the same day.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was among the few countries that are still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the 24 hours before 10 am (0800 UTC) on April 4.
The US has recorded more than 2.44 lakh coronavirus cases and at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 deaths have been reported in the US due to the coronavirus on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted in favour of extending the national emergency by 15 days; the resolution passed by 215 votes, ten members were absent and one voted against.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a round-the-clock curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the first curfew was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dawkins announced that the state's stay-at-home order has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that could be purchased at one time in all their stores nationally to two and one packages, respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages at checkout sites and on the Facebook pages of the series.
It is reported that the buyers were shopping together for a situation where they needed to keep themselves most isolated due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on the purchase of a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in his March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban being in place, "the stock is still being exhausted within an hour of delivery to many stores," and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokeswoman for Woolworths, there was a "strong bounce" in sales last week.
The Canberra-based Costco store also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortfall, Coles placed orders for larger packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI raised stocks to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available sooner.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said retailers should try to raise stocks, but it is difficult to do so because of restrictions imposed by the local council on truck delivery time.
When suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has already been reduced, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after premature release of the stock, some stores may not be able to operate a Wednesday special.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavier item, so it does not have a large number of stocks, and then, when the entire stock is sold, the large shelves are left empty, making the shortage more difficult to realize.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, "Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were enough goods on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizers could be [purchased] and in large quantities, the chaos could possibly have been reduced."
Hu Gives A Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that his stock had run out.
According to news.com.au, the company Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures cleanex toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures sorbents, said they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where fewer auctions are being held earlier due to buyers celebrating holidays on the long weekend of Labor Day, some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to first bidders at the auction.
A daily printed in Darwin, the Thursday edition of NT News had an eight-page insert that was cut and given to be used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, the store was initially unwilling to impose restrictions; the report said it had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry items, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, a 12-roll two-pack limit was also imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper at the online British supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV-2, a global pandemic.
While the term "global pandemic" only means how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
If the country detects the disease in its response, treats patients, keeps them at the most isolated, tracks them and unites them," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity."
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published by CNN in February, he had said that "no other respiratory virus, except influenza, has been detected in the continuous global spread."
Gabrielis also expressed a similar idea when he said, "We have never seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus so far."
"And we haven't seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new title of the global pandemic comes after the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak an internationally alarming public health emergency in January.
"One thing of a hundred things, it's going to get worse," said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths, the Associated Press reported.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The case fatality rate in China has been estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and bloating.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, prompting postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and panic buying by people has led to a massive drop in supplies.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationwide or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, East and Southeast Asian origin and other people of color, and others from regions with more virus cases.
Lower travel and heavy industry closures have led to a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (capital of Hubei province) reported mass cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is considered to have an zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-spreading virus known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the latter was not associated with the visible mass market group.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with the reduction of new cases in China, there has been a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea. The number of new cases outside China was the first to exceed the number of new cases within China.
Very little information of cases may have been reported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, of whom 19 years of age and under were 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Wallace, the chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before an effective group immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and according to official protocols whose tests have been positively confirmed.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unreported infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original fertility number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 are recovering.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 had caused about 97,000 deaths.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in general, according to official protocols, refers to the dead who have tested positive for COVID.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it cannot include people who die without testing such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Italy's partial data found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted “we know [the so-called death toll] has been annexed”, a statement that is supported by descriptive information of low computation in the U.S. Such annexations usually occur in the pandemic, as was the case with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred on February 14 in France.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each recorded more than a dozen deaths.
By 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and regions on every continent except Antarctica. A number of measures are generally used to determine the extent of mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global case-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the death-to-death ratio is estimated to have decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and Infection Mortality Rate (IFR), which is a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates an overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this limit is in line with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final period of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary according to location.
"When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks generally stabilize and start decreasing when the nutrients are no longer available for the disease," said McKee's Bonnie of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable guesses as to when that will happen."
Zhang Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 is "possibly going to be circulating for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, because it's so easily transmitted," said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "and it could turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The intensity of the return group will depend on the extent of immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people infected can be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cuffs), reduced sense of smell, inhalation, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, colds, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or nausea. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. More development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, death syndrome.
Some of the infected may be symptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened so as to overcome the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the symbolic proportion ranges from some to 44%.
The normal morbidity period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell, was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly by small droplets generated during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without a face covering can lead to drops ranging from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets generated while speaking that stay in the air for longer. Breathing droplets can also be generated while exhaling, including when speaking, although the virus is not airborne in general.
The drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through inhalation into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as duct insertion and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to be vaginalized and thus airborne proliferation.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may spread by feces, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
Tests have come positive for people's disease for three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible before important symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of symptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but symptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can pass from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which disintegrates its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the group of beta-coronavirus, the subspecies of Sarbecovirus (genesis B), with two bat-derived breeds genetically.
This is similar to 96% of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
So far in the entire genome comparison, the common genetic content between pangolins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be up to a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to certify the intermediate nutrients to pangolins.
The infection by the virus can be detected temporarily based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with its many image characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a primary test for testing or diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasopharyngeal phase, but a nasopharyngeal phase can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Symptomal image characteristics on symptomatic people's radiography and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral ground glass ambiguities and absent pleural secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imagery findings for confirmed cases.
Having similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, imagery has limited uniqueness in identifying COVID-19, without being confirmed by PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although the imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of viruses with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent the transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into a trash can.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they got infected. Care providers taking care of an infected person are recommended to carry out standard precautions, contact precautions and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data of mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about ways to prevent infection are spreading; for example, it is not effective to rub the nose and rinse with mouthwash.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after splashing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
In addition, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions, including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iode (within a minute of disinfectant exposure to a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chromhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at an office or day care facility.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue while coughing or sneezing and then immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount of drops and the distance to be fixed by breathing when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.” Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are taking care of a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by ordinary people.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical facial masks made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come into close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks of clothes at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when going to public areas.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks when going out, while it is also recommended to make homemade face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control functions, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandated or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The rapid reduction in the maximum population recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations ranged from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and acute immune system have the goal of making social distancing or social distancing more of a risk of complications so that the term "distance" is used and they are advised by the CDC to end the "March" in areas with community outbreaks as much as possible at home.
The implications arose from the use of the term “making social distance” that, instead of encouraging people to stay in contact with others through alternative means, they should adopt complete social isolation. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with a person you live with, who does not have symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have made self-quarantine mandatory or recommended for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are inhibition or suppression, and mitigation.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as implementing other measures and vaccinations to control the infection so as to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of the disease, efforts go to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
Both prevention and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, to reverse the epidemic by reducing the original fertility number from 1. A part of managing outbreaks of infectious disease is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of deterioration of health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-quarantine; stricter community measures intended to create physical distancing such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass gatherings in cities. The stricter measures were taken in China. The stricter measures were taken when the whole process was undertaken; the more community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as the surface cleaning measures.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed a huge fine on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce demand for extreme health care by 2/3 and death by half, but even after these hundreds of people die and health systems crumble.
Suppression can be given priority, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is first), otherwise the transmission from dysfunction in measures returns rapidly.
Long-term intervention for the suppression of the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold-causing medications without a prescription, drinking fluids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The results can be worse than using steroids.
Several compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity for the needs of COVID-19 patients and optimizing health care, has been described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The European Regional Office of ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines for transferring resources to hospitals and primary health care services at several levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing the number of intensive care capabilities and ventilators available by training personnel.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the bulk market of Hunan sea-food, in which live animals were also sold, and one is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of animal origin. The pneumonia group with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was diagnosed on December 27 by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who was treated on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumours and another doctor, I Feen, was rebuked by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed WHO.
A considerable number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, as a result of which investigations were initiated in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year and being the Wuhan Transportation Center and the major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official statistics show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the US has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, several countries in the Schengen area have banned free movement and established border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (or stay-at-home orders, shelter orders at their place, or lockdown) and curfew. As of 2 April, about 300 million people in the US or about 90% of the population are in some form of lockdown, lockdown in the Philippines. More than 1.3 million people are in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion people two days later - nearly a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case occurred on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian saw a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019, indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
Following the arrival of these information, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission had initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched an aggressive campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was called the "People's War" by Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history," a siege zone was announced in Wuhan on January 23 to prevent movement, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Houston Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Liechtenstein Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government established additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Measures to operate remotely were established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movements in many cities were controlled, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external ban. After the outbreak came to its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
Beijing, for example, has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, only one case was transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this instance through a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically stopped and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
The travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, on the same day two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, with no specifics on when the policy would expire.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The state council declared a day of mourning on April 4, starting at 10:00 am, with a three-minute national silence, which was at the time of the Qingming celebrations, although the central government asked the families to observe Shraddha Pati while making physical distance online to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to a crowd gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as Jesus' Shincheonji Church.
Shincheonji devotees who came from Wuhan to Daegu were doubtful of the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 or about 13% of the church's 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of warning on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined when tests confirmed that the three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline program was also affected and therefore changed. The program South Korea introduced was considered to be the largest and best organized program in the world to check populations for the virus and isolate any infected people as well as to detect and quarantine those who contacted them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-information of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, quick testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea’s program is considered a breakthrough in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in’s crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that from April 1, all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in KOM on February 19, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the closure of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities before the Persian New Year Navarros.
By 16 March 2020, Shia pilgrimage sites in Kom were open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became the epicenter of the virus transmission after China.
Amid claims to conceal the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that the amount of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government as of that day.
The Iranian parliament was shut down when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release detained human rights defenders for peaceful protests and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It said that closed institutions such as containment centres are at higher risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new cases every hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases reported in Iran could be five times higher.
It has also been suggested that the US sanctions imposed on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to postpone all flights from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was detected. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new judicial-law to prevent the outbreak, which quarantined more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas with outbreaks, entry and exit will not be provided.
Work activities and sporting events in those areas have already been ordered to be postponed.” On 4 March the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths occurred in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held without eyewitnesses until April, but on March 9, all games were completely postponed for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published the protocols for the sorting of cannabis, serious patients, ethics of medicine.

As of April 5, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test people who had the virus at the time may have contributed to higher mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most relaxed of the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British government had not imposed any kind of social distancing or large-scale quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in response to the concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to stop all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home where possible and avoid places like pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers up to the limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced strict social distancing measures, including restrictions on gatherings of more than two people and restrictions on travel and outdoor activity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police through imposition of fines and dispersal of mobs.
Most businesses, except those considered "essentials," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations, and garages, were ordered to close.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the U.S. government's leading public health institution - announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. slowed down testing, making it difficult to understand the actual expansion of the outbreak at the time.
Defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies, and hospitals) by the end of February, and testing was interrupted by restrictive criteria (a physician's order was then required) to qualify for a test of people by the beginning of March.

Trump's overall preference for crisis management is tied to partisan forms.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S. dependence on imports of critical materials, including essential medical supplies from China.
Air travel patterns were used to map and predict the spread of the analysis and were published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali was described as the least competent of the 20 most popular destination cities in terms of preparedness, while Australia's cities were considered the most competent. Australia released its emergency response plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
Not much is known about COVID-19 according to it, and that Australia will emphasize border controls and communications in response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.

Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The test results declared all South Africans uninfected, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all under observation and quarantined at The Ranch Resort for a period of 14 days.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students from U.S. universities united to help send aid to parts affected by the virus to China, including a joint group in the Chicago area that reportedly sent 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief sent masks to Wuhan Union Hospital by 30 January, in coordination with FedEx.

Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed their concerns on China-made masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 China-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of just 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks that were defective.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, believed to have come from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency aid campaigns for developing countries.
The WHO has appreciated the efforts of Chinese authorities in the management and containment of the pandemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered efforts to prevent and containment, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galia commented that while "certainly the 2009 WHO had not recommended the incubation period" it was "a very important sign of the commitment of the public to contain the pandemic from the incubation period of the incubation period of the P.H.I.C.E. in the post-incubation period of the in which the P.H.H.E.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the cause of PHEIC was "the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle-income countries without strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros said there was “no reason for such measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community to contribute $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that do not have "systems to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was about to emerge."
Tedros announced in further statements that “we are only as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more later”. On February 11, WHO established the name of the disease as COVID-19 in a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to "provide the power of the entire UN system in response."
As a result, a UN crisis management team was activated, which coordinated the response of the entire UN, which according to WHO would enable them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise in tolerating the widespread social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak."
On February 14, a joint mission team led by WHO with China should help in domestic management and by hosting workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions, the WHO should be ready to assess the "severeness and infectivity of the disease" in the early stages, but the WHO has now made it possible to make an "international declaration of the pandemic" and the "experts in the urban and rural arrangements, in order to assess the impact of the response activities at the provincial and county levels," visited the region.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO authorities said that the threat of coronavirus globally would be assessed from "high" to "very high," the highest level of vigilance and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that “this is a reality check for every government on earth: it’s time to wake up.”
This virus may be coming on its way and you need to be prepared," urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid "the worst of it."
Ryan added that current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, saying that such an announcement would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human on Earth will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The director-general said WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity". The WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as an epidemic.
The retaliation, signed by 733,000 people by April 6, included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed on respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and it is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that a lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts emphasized that everyone, including people with disabilities, minority groups, older people, internally displaced people, people living in the homeless, in extreme poverty, people living in conflict, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups requiring government assistance, has the right to health.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
From policies to strengthening health systems and addressing the impacts of travel restrictions and restrictions on the world economy, the digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government's U.S., Britain's minister for cabinet office Michael Gove, and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro have been criticised for tackling the pandemic that begins in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were sacked to deal with quarantine efforts in central China, indicating dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a prior acceptance of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that China's "control system has turned a virus into a global pandemic now," which some critics have regarded as distracting from racism and "the failure of their administration to prevent disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government wire that underlines communications mobilization with clear origins in the National Security Council, citing the strategy as "all about China."
“Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s attempt to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of propaganda to increase the global impact.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that it has "a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through manipulation and the 'policy of liberality'."
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions from Syria, Venezuela and Iran, which have reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting aid intended for other nations to their own country.
And there have been mask-related disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with the coronavirus-hit Italy.
Italy's ambassador to the European Union Maurizio Massari said that "only China responded bilaterally."
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to the Russian military.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper quoted an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "in vain or very little use of Italy."
The source accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" flattery.
Lombardy President Atilio Fontena and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mio refuted the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has sent medical aid to the United States from a cargo plane.
"Providing assistance to U.S. allies [Putin] believes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials will increase production, they will also be able to repay if necessary," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
NATO's largest combat exercise since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, NATO "Defender 2020" military exercises will be held at a low level.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of US and soldiers of many European countries, but also the residents of countries participating in it where they are working.” The Iranian government has also been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the current political parliament infected or others as well as Panda.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders seeking help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has led the United States to socialize its funds into the form of universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and other levels of high public health policy.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-appointed sites.
South Korean society was initially divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, or praised his response, claiming the government's mismanagement of the outbreak. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, suspend elections as well as parliament and punish those found to be tackling the virus and the crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, which have arisen from the use of equipment to fight the outbreak globally, fear-induced shopping, and disruptions to factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Many localities also saw fear-induced shopping conditions, which led to a shortage of essential grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a drop in supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has been warned about delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
Due to this demand, the normal price has increased by up to twenty times and at the same time the supply of medical items has been delayed for four to six months.
This has led to a lack of personal protective equipment around the world, prompting WHO to warn that it will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided Daegu shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and high demand for food products in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both regions have survived an extreme shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the hoarding and illicit trade of important products have been successful, protecting against the extreme shortage of food that was projected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decline in its significant agricultural production, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were also seen only temporarily in the city of Wuhan, when Chinese government officials released sugar-meat stores to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has suffered losses: Government measures to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%, according to a media report on March 16, caused deep damage to the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
Since mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus is considered to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Economist Intelligence Unit's Agatha Demiris has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clear picture emerges on the potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could be greater than the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis showed an impact of $300<0x2B> billion on the world's supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly "fighted" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day decline since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt eligibility determination, but maintained a negative expectation.
Stocks fell again on the basis of coronavirus apprehensions, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic downturn.
Economist Mohammad al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures of central banks and states.
Central banks are responding more quickly than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst-affected areas due to the advice of governments to stop any travel around the world, including travel restrictions, closure of public places including travel attractions.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quants, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the most seen so far.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The timing of this pandemic also coincides with the time of Chunyuan, a major travel session associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events, including annual New Year's celebrations, were canceled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland independently.
Many lunar New Year celebrations and tourist attractions have been closed in Beijing to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, with most workplaces instructed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, shutting down schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with store hours reduced or temporarily closed.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers from North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
In March, the number of people walking to shopping centers declined by 33-43% compared to February.
The operators of shopping malls around the world took additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, setting up thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperatures, and cancelling ceremonies. According to a UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America who would not be in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in inland provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the US and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the unemployment rate could fall to 32%. Many million migrant workers have become unemployed due to lockdown in India (which has resulted in 900,000 jobs being lost in the middle of 2020 due to their daily wages.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal loan scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on government-funded short-term working plans called Kurzweilerbet.
The German Short-Term Work Compensation Plan has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has impacted the operations of organizations globally as well as individuals working and working independently.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector strive to maintain their (mostly publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely, with their exhibitions, ceremonies, and exhibitions canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through the digital platform. Another recent and fast-growing result of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that observations of Holy Week in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian mourning session of Lent, have been canceled.
Many bishop-sectors have recommended older Christians to stay home instead of being largely present on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Bishop-Region of Rome closing its churches and prayer halls and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples, and gurudwaras and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed pilgrimage sites, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption to the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled on a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments postponed.
Due to this, many gamblers are adopting the online method, which has reported a significant increase in the rates of new sign-ups in many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to work and share on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as creating live streaming of concerts or web-based "features" to promote artists' performance, distribution, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread amidst uncertainty as humor and distraction.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia and racism have been noted for increasing bias towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and people with hotspots in Europe, the US, and other countries.
Many countries, especially Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have witnessed incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Since February, information (when most cases were still limited to China) has documented racist feelings of Chinese people in various groups around the world being worthy of receiving the virus or receiving justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak's progress in new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience severe outbreaks of COVID-19, may also experience skepticism and xenophobia. Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent the disease.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan went viral on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the U.S. have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," which was regarded by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign vacuum cleaners from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and "so God has avenged them."
Later, the Chinese consulate in Kolkata condemned the remarks, calling it "misleading". In China, xenophobia and racism toward non-Chinese residents received a boost from the pandemic, describing foreigners as targets for "foreign garbage" and "removal".
Many newspapers with paywalls removed him for some or all of his coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced as a response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (blood-science) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Antibodies tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who were too mild to indicate symptoms or who were symptom-free.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among people.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable inequalities in how many tests have been conducted in different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal fibrillation or mucus samples, can be tested.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test done with the sores of the throat is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternately sample material can then be taken from the airway through the suction catheter or coughing material (bulgum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Berlin in January 2020 in Charité, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed testing kits by 23 January 2020. South Korean company KoganBiotech developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It explores the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene distributed in SARS-CoV-2 specifically. In China, the BGI Group is the 2019 National Medical Products Administration of China's National Medical Products Laboratory (BGI Group) by Diagnostic Clinical Control of Diseases (PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit) and was one of the first companies in the United States to receive emergency use approval.
One of the three genetic tests in the earlier versions of the testing kit yielded inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and caused problems in testing on the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered credible till 28th February 2020 and state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate testing till then.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country till 9th March 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; the aggregation and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11th February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Services in Healthcare. On 12th March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect the infection of COVID-19. On 13th March 2020, Rosh Diagnostics was allowed by the FDA for a high-dose test to be carried out within 3.5 hours. As a result of which 8 tests can be carried out from a machine, in a period of about 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sheffield received an EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved an investigation in which isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology is used instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can yield positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests every day. A testing kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus. This 15-minute influenza test, with the hopes of a 15-minute rapid influenza test.
A literature review of March 2020 concluded that “the early stage of chest radiography has less clinical significance, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features of CT include biological multilober ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effects of subparticles, crazy paving and consolidation develop.
The current epidemiological source point, a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, suggests that many of the depictions of CT are similar to other pneumonia and disease processes, despite being less specific it is significantly more sensitive than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a first-line test or a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of immunosuppressants, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals starting from 7 days after the onset of symptoms and to monitor people. Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to look at the immune response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
The first evacuation step of the test, different from PCR methods, is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units which provided information to the agency when required and are thus now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their testing kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that any antibodies they purchased were not good enough for the test kit use.
Hong Kong planned in which the suspected patient can stay at home, “the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube”, they will spit back into it and get the results of the investigation in a short time. The British NHS announced that they are starting a plan to examine suspected cases at home, taking precautions from the sampling specialist who is taking COVID-19 to prevent the risk of the patient from infecting others.
Drive-through testing centers have helped conduct the fastest, most comprehensive checks from any country in South Korea. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that their ambulatory settings had the capacity to conduct about 12,000 checks per day and conducted 10,700 checks in the past week.
When the examination is ordered by the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, drive-through checks were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey observed that as of week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 samples were examined, including week 12/2020, and 33491 (6.9%) of the samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of February. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Remum Hospital found that the samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-1 and, if combined, the time of testing was 64 days.
With oversight of the construction by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model observed that if this checking capability was not initiated, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the associated cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory has been immediately followed by Huo-Yen Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple-signed open source outlines have been released by Origami Essay which can test up to a maximum of 1122 samples of COVID19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced outlines can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Prior to March, reagent deficiencies and inadequate quantities became a problem in large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore protocols for sample preparation, including heating the samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now raising its population to a level higher than any other country for coronavirus testing at per capita rate.
This was due to the ability to conduct drive-through testing and the combination of Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing labs in China) to purchase population-scale mass-throughput labs.
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted and sent Germany’s method of manufacturing kits to developing low-income countries themselves.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of checks in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak there were problems with the reliability of the check kits between China and the United States and these were able to supply enough to meet the demand and recommendations of testing by the country and Australia health experts.
In contrast, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, especially in the private sector laboratories, was developed by the South Korean government over the years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said enhancing testing programs was the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused thousands of outstanding tests to be piled up in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of phalanges and chemical reagents became tense.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its testing kits.
In the United States, the check kits developed by the CDC were “decreased”; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were blocking private checks. Spain purchased check kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm pointed out that the wrong results could be due to the failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the wrong checking kits and replace the second check kit provided by Shenzhen Bioegy. 80% of the check kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million check kits from China, which were not found accurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they should be put into the Danube. Turkish Health Ministry Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara said that the check kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they "didn't use them". UK which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020 announced that they were not usable.
After testing, those who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive.
Instead of dying from the first COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the Italian town of V<0xC3><0xB2> examined the entire population of about 3,400 people twice over a span of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all of the people with all discovered cases were quarantined.
The new infections were completely eliminated from the travel ban on the incoming and outgoing destination.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been significantly slower than in other developed countries without aggressive contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantine, but with extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home since March 28, but reopened on time on March 23 after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also aggressively managed the pandemic by detecting contact, by restricting internal travel, by checking and quarantine, but by less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with higher death rates have a much lower case fatality rate than those with higher death rates, possibly because these countries are more capable of detecting only mild or symptom-free people.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and national laboratories that have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of positives in tests" is influenced by the country's check policy.
On the other hand, in a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at any "necessary moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the stool-headed pathway.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments during the day where it is important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s buttocks or changing the lingot, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands can be cleaned with ash if water and soap are not available. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby using the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Therapeutic hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to therapeutic procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean by hand the pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and the chemicals that can cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the therapeutic field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in cases of delivery at home.
A 2013 study showed that well-hand washing exercises in children under the age of five could slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as an automatic induced behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and deep respiratory infections (ARIs).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, with an estimated 1.8 million children dying each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill about 3.5 million children annually.
Making hand washing a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, according to UNICEF, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning system measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is spread through direct physical contact.
One small harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause damage to the skin due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often, hand washing is also seen as a symptom of psychotic compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease from the fecal-headed pathway: after using the toilet (urine immersion, fecal-absence), after cleaning the baby’s buttocks (after changing the lungs), before feeding the baby, before eating and/or consuming raw meat, fish, or meat.
Other occasions when proper hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent the transmission of the disease are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or splashing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing by 97 percent; in the United States with 77 percent the adoption of handwashing was moderate; and in China with 23 percent the rate of handwashing is now the lowest in many countries. Hand washing practices with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of massive action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national program includes daily tooth cleaning with fluoride as well as daily hand washing with soap, taking anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It can be better to remove microorganisms from the skin by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the barriers in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an unskilled skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are the components of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
And the water helps with the healing of the soul.
Due to repeated use, solid soap may contain bacteria left over from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to bacteria being washed with foam.
However, according to the CDC, "soaps with liquid soap dropping facility on palms without touching hands are better".
There has been a publicity campaign with emphasis on antibacterial soaps for the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin-protecting agents, refined formulations include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobial-active benzoic acid and other skin adapters (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants) in the nucleus of the nucleus of the nucleus.
Comfortable hot water for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria increase very rapidly at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, cold, hot, soapy water is more effective than soapy water to remove soil and bacterial-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand sanitizer with water-free base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcoholic water-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectants hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began gaining popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated with carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) in a gel such as condensing agents, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, or glycerin in a liquid or foam such as a moisturizer.
Combining tanu hydrogen-peroxide increases antimicrobial activation further. Hand sanitizers containing 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol lord sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol Rab sanitizers containing 70% alcohol destroy 99.97% bacteria after 30 seconds of application (similar to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and 1 minute after implantation kill 99.99% to 99.999% bacteria. The bacteria have 4 to 5 log reduction. Some of the most effective hand sanitizers are bacterial antibodies.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective towards norovirus (or Norwalk) types of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal swelling. Enough hand disinfectant or alcohol lords should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and in the middle and all finger pores are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
Fingers should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing in both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick destructive activation towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by mixing glycerin and/or other lubricants in the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing lubricants significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial agents.
Rarely allergic to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs are contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity.
The low tendency to induce disturbing contact dermatitis compared to washing hands with soap and water became a attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered agents do not clean organic substances with their hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers relies heavily on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce effectiveness after repeated use due to possibly progressive adverse skin reactions, has been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activation after applying formulations using benzalconium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil alone can be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it can increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The correct technique of hand washing recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Flow water is recommended because basins with static water can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Make proper amount of soap including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails by scavenging and foaming on the hands.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rinse for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are released by rubbing for longer.
Wash well under running water.
Washing in the basin can contaminate the hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most neglected areas are the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chippy nail polish can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect the hands from drying; dry skin can cause damage to the skin which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost alternatives can be made to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from a hanging pot or ash with suitable pores. In situations of limited water supply (e.g., schools or rural areas), water-protection solutions are available.
Tipi-tap is a simple technique in which a lever, operated by one foot, is used to pour a small amount of water on the jaw hanging by the rope, and on the hands and soap ticks.
Hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A large amount of research suggests that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on finger mattresses and 254% on palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria by 42% on average on finger mattresses and 15% on palms.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on finger mattresses and up to 77% on palms. Scientists also conducted tests to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in cross-contamination potential of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which emits air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and possibly contaminate the toilet environment of other toilet users and up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers present, and hand dryers are compared with drying with paper towels.
Washing hands using hand sanitizer wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Therapeutic hand washing became mandatory long after the discovery of its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of the disease in the hospital environment by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they are forgotten.
In one study, the use of these has been found to reduce the infection rate.
Therapeutically wash hands for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which the foam is made using the appropriate amount of soap and water or gel and rub each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there are rubbish under the nails, a tight-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being re-contaminated from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbials") and prevent them from being transmitted.
Not washing hands in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, according to The New England Journal of Medicine, with a large number of physicians and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
A study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing in the health care sectors.
Documentary guidance on hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by VitBi and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if the performance of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has set “five opportunities” for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluids
prior to the onset of the disease, and
After the care of the patient. Adding disinfectant chemicals in soap ("pharmaceutical" or "antimicrobial" soap) provides the hand-washing agent with the potential to kill.
Before surgery or in a system in which antibiotic resistant organisms are highly widespread, such an attacking ability may be desired. For surgical tear-to-ripe to 'crush' your hands, there is a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching the hands. To disinfect and disinfect the underbrush, to disinfect some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfect to dry the hands after washing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing the wrists up to the hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand wash is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of a sick person or use a hand disinfectant.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by more than 35%, very little additional benefit was received.
By washing hands with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is more than three times higher than by washing with antibacterial soap. Hand rubbing with an alcohol-based solution is more than 26% compared to hand washing with antibacterial soap. Compared with hand washing with antibacterial soap, the bactericidal bactericidal is less than 30 minutes.
But hands-on H1N1 Influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile are more effective than soap and water alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems can include education on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and allowing employees to be written and verbal.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an affordable, necessary means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, it is a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior from lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, in schools and at the workplace.
For example, hand washing faucets are very few near every private or public toilet in most rural Africa, even though there are cheap options to build a hand washing station.
However, lower hand washing rates may also be due to spilled habits rather than due to lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and support of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social campaigns are less effective. An example for the promotion of handwashing in schools is the “three-star method” by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that other sanitation requirements are met by handwashing—as well as students.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars, respectively.
Creating a hand washing station can be a part of hand washing campaigns that are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to protection from DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in injured soldiers in hospitals - was first identified in the mid-19th century by two promoters of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who had worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the founder of the English language.
Most people at the time believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness about the importance of hand washing with soap in many countries to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with the "right techniques of hand washing" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and toilets at airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing your hands” from something means declaring your unwillingness to take responsibility for that thing or to assume collusion in it.
It derives from the Bible’s Matthew chapter where Pontius Pilate separated himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up a fictional stain, reflecting her criminal spirit about the crimes she committed and the inciting her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or contemplating immoral actions, and give more importance to a hand washing device.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensatory tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapy water without washing hands are Bahai religion, Hinduism, Tewila in Judaism and Natilat Yadayim, Lavabo in Christianity, and also a part of the ritual hand washing described in many religions in Islam, including the Waz<0xC5><0x8D>. After washing hands is a part of the ritual washing of the hands. Some functions of religions in particular.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are the applications of occupational safety and health practices for the control of hazards.
Proper control of the risk of spreading disease at the workplace depends on the workplace and the work to be done, based on risk assessments of contact sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and risk factors of individual personnel who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk actions have minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate contact risk actions are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who have contact with the general public such as a school, a high population-density work environment, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, measures to control the dangers for this group include: air-conditioning from high-efficiency air filters, using snail guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for the condition if the person infected with COVID-19 faces.
OSHA considers health personnel and dead-house personnel at high exposure risk to a person who is exposed to COVID-19 infected or suspected, and this risk increases to a higher exposure risk if personnel perform procedures that generate aerosols on an infected or suspected person with COVID-19, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have many effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential contact.
What goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as shopping through low demand times or delivery or moving services), can change the nature of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of objects from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including the source of risk, risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, and risk factors of individual personnel such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address those risks and the contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of responding to an outbreak include: reducing transmission between employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the responses to be adopted in the community with a business location.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure that is widely used to group hazard controls according to their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without depending on employee behavior, and may be the most economical solution in implementing it.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
All types of PPE should be selected based on risk to personnel, appropriately fitted (e.g., respirators), regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk tasks have minimal business contact with people and other colleagues.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and well-washing of hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquette covering cough and sneeze, cleaning of tissues and waste utensils, performing routine cleansing and cleaning of appliances, if necessary, preparing equipments for teleportation or transferring, personnel to others.
Early identification and isolation of potential infectious persons at the workplace is an important step to protect personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute ovarian disease stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-lowering or other symptom-changing medications.
According to the OSHA, moderate contact risk actions involve actions that require repeated or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the person has recently traveled international locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include those who interact with the general public, such as schools, COVID-19, high-density work environments, and some of the high-volume sales arrangements. For this and high-risk groups, it is necessary to provide COVID-concepts and personal-concepts, it is necessary to provide personal-concepts and personal-concepts, it is necessary to establish high-efficiency air filters, it is necessary to facilitate, it.
Employees in this risk group rarely require the use of a respirator.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, proper controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person to 6 feet from others, designating a member of the crew to serve the sick person, and asking the sick person to wear a face mask or to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when the sick person coughs or sneezes.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when taking care of the sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, frequent cough, or difficulty breathing, should potentially wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, there are travel delays and self-isolation when sick under the controls of dangers. Developed self-isolation and immediately notify the medical center if the fever or other symptoms occur when a person on board the ship is on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the room of the isolated person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as cancelling meals in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, shifting arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel carrying out daily law activities, immediate health risks are considered by the CDC as follows.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected individuals with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during catching, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment before reusing, using household cleaning spray or wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the contraception and disposal of the used PPE and for the contraception and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care and dead-home personnel to be in the high or ultra-high categories of exposure risk.
High-contact risk tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high contact risk if personnel perform, collect, or handle procedures that generate aerosols on known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Processes that produce aerosols include duct insertion, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or collecting samples from incisions.
High-contact morphology functions include people who prepare the body of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high-contact risk if they perform the autopsy. In additional engineering controls for these risk groups, procedures that generate aerosols are involved, including during the isolation of known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
Typical negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and dead-home arrangements.
The samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in different waiting areas, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the procedures they generate aerosols.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepiece respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, chonga and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE required for specific tasks, using masks to reduce the need for therapeutic care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, using the same respirator, inspecting and coordinating the PPE supply chain.

Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No Rights Reserved
This month there are extraordinary circumstances all around us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear to all the people in the world to be interconnected and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community enhancement, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of cordiality we have seen among all of our colleagues through emails, calls and chats is an extraordinary testimony of how privileged we have been to work with such extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues that I cannot say in words.
Last week, one person shared with me the appreciation of our work.
It reminded me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to keep this very important resource online and accessible to all.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of the salary of our colleagues or keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information it gets from Wikipedia, and now it needs the most.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to this mission, and the importance of your role in it, we are going to make some remarkable changes in the way we work with us this coming week.
Changes in our work and time-frames
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a timetable for the days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response we had in our thinking to the situation before us, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve tensions and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work requirements will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more than usual hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to the doctor, your expertise is our priority.
We don't want to waste your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
No need to say it, but we are saying it.
You don't need a sick leave or PTO - just let your manager know and help your team make changes to the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work are seen by no-one.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please tell Brian of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you and make sure that appropriate attention is paid by the management to your situation.)
Hourly employees will get full salary.
We have already said so, and we are once again reaffirming our commitment to fulfill our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will get a salary based on his or her normal working hours during normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick and cannot work, you will get a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to give way out of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely gratifying, especially in times like these.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
We want you to talk to your manager so that we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things that we cannot stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security, and grant accumulation teams (and others) perform critical tasks that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess existing objectives and to focus our attention on collaborating the essentials for our mission
We all have a lot to do, we will all just focus on the most essential projects.
By slowing down now, we will avoid injury later.
We have no plans to "give double time to compensate" after the global pandemic has passed.
Now you will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines beyond reality.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What will happen with the App (Annual Planning)?
In order to adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we want to revisit the timeline for the completion of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that will allow us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their over-the-counter work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and adjust those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of time-frame will bring a significant reduction in our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organization.
We will put our proposal before the board of directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office Status, Contact, and Cleaning
Last week we found out that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning staff to decontaminate all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface from the hospital-grade anti-viral solution, to the lobby, and to the elevator bank that came up to our floor.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocols using products that help protect its residents.
We are confident that the office will be ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week, our DC office had adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based co-workers know, there is also a discussion going on about hiring a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are going on but there may be delays.
Some of our co-workers are working from home/away from home for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working from home/distance for a long time know that adjustments will be needed for this, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours increments.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them over several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video your default option with the help of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and integration.
Take the initiative to facilitate every meeting, monitor a person’s chat for questions and keep the speaker list in check, and help a person take notes (or take notes in collaboration)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to tech support.
Use your health insurance to pay for your health care.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring webinar-based labour efficiency guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO announced the end of the global pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be punished for being constrained to delay or amend those goals.
This coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and community conferences.
This barrier causes a sense of sadness in the global community as a whole, but also a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on our own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on the Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact regarding COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in this situation and we are here to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this email on the Office Wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
The CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also currently working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries.
If you have something to ask about travel, events, a major workflow, or a coverage challenge, or you need help with regard to something else, please feel free to inform the CRT and work with it.
We are here to help provide support and establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our duties and obligations.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our actions and obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can act, provide our activities with the support they need, and continue to provide the service the world relies on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it's time to help each other, and create space for important work to come in the coming weeks and possibly the coming months.
We all need you to make it possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Linnet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the respective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and by increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point in cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the intestine and other cells.
The ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal colectin renal amino acid carrier domain.
ACE2 is a one-time transverse type I membrane protein with enzymatically active domains uncovered on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the membrane domain by another enzyme called the sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cell membranes of the lung type II aerodynamic cells, the intravenous cells of the small intestine, artery and vein, and the soft muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
The appearance of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebrum vulture, striatum, hypothalamus and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a talent of ACE.
ACE dissolves the angiotensin I hormone into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 then dissolves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it into the vessel-expanding angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Iry-Phe)
ACE2 can also decompose many other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bredicain, applein, neurotensine, dynorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the noseless amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and its role has been reported in Hartnap disease.
As membrane proteins, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-generating virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-generating virus).
More specifically, linking SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 proteins leads to the transfer of both viruses and enzymes into the enzymes located within the cells.
This admission process also requires the activation of S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under current investigation as a potential therapy. Due to this, some people have hypothesized that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia.”
Also, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in those with trauma and heart failure."
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less dominant than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered the new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pig infants with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour effect process (period).
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is increased.

COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed to build the contact tracing application.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
The less intrusive option involves the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will directly integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. A similar app (“StopCovid”) has also been employed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, which is designed to ensure they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including mis-positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations to determine what types of organizations can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
Monitoring must be "legitimate, necessary and proportionate";
There should be an expiry clause for the expansion of supervision and monitoring;
The use of the data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data protection and anonymity should be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided to promote discrimination and disqualification;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to abuse and abuse;
"Significant participation" will be required by all "relevant stakeholders" including public health experts and authoritarian groups. The German Caos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grenajen) (RSF) have also released the checklist.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to solve the problem of persistent monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require learning to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interpersonal communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to conduct contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Many countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details were not yet released.
Privacy-protection contact tracing has been a well-established concept with a large body of research literature since at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user’s proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that involves both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DPPA-3T), the mechanism for the provisional contact number (TCN, formerly contact event numbers), mobile sensitive, Pro Privacy.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protection techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gone Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, SafeTrace, which was originally established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that essentially organized in terms of similar approaches and broadly similar protocols aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving broader adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it has open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and the companies that control Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three stages:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing app
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android.
Drug rehabilitation (also known as drug re-purpose, re-profiling, re-appointment or therapeutic change) is the re-approval of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research instructions include plasma transfusions related to the development and health benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides a reasonable project to develop effective antiviral drugs to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papyrus-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofosphate.
Hussain and others studied a number of candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed their linearity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA through the process of clinical trials and is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to have shown Favipiravir to be "clearly effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen had a negative test on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy medicine from Japan for its reserves, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir and ritonavir, a combination of antiviral lopinavir/ ritonavir (caletra), concluded that "no benefit was seen".
The drugs were created to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism within the scientific community about directing resources for the re-purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the international Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activation to protect against several filo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and corona-viruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies show that remdesivir can have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials run by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with moderate disease and the other for those with more serious disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and critically ill with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Japan, is planning a clinical trial for an endocrine corticosteroid for asthma, Tegins Alvesco (cyclosodine), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing pre-diagnosis symptoms of the novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients hospitalized from severe, hospitalized cases to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anti-scandals are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-charged heparin is being widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian Drug Agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium on preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purpose of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments are:

Testing also in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, a number of efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop the vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
The essentials of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine for protection against COVID-19.
Advanced major platform goals in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Step I Developers and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Step I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to the Milliken Institute, 79), and 37 others are declared, but less public information is available (designed or envisaged in planning).
Preliminary safety and immunosuppression tests are performed in a phase I-II test, this is usually done randomly, placebo-controlled and at multiple sites, determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, a control group monitoring the adverse effects at optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was examining the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine aimed at starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, the Yanssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Shutemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Waxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaccart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, Oncogene, a laboratory in Romania, published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neo-antigen immunization therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he has finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and is starting trials.
On February 27, 2020, Nugenrex Immuno-Oncology, a generics subsidiary, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a Li-Key peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Western Maryland at Silver Spring both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it would be in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work closely with Inc.
The partners announced plans for a pre-clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 cutters, and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on a fast track.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which is planned for human trials for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Curacao "a large sum of money for special learning of the COVID-19 vaccine," against which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is currently in a pre-clinical trial, whose clinical trial is expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotechnology company Techis Biotech announced that they would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and that trials on their final vaccine candidate could be started by the fall.
On 19 March 2020, in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, including the Institute Pasteur, Thames Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes a total of US$29 million in the development of COVID-19 Vaccine CEPI.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curacao, Innova, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-produced RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur, with plans to establish a C$192 million specifically for developing a COVID-19 vaccine.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the test of a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCovacc in mice, stating that "MNA provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines had antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] 2 weeks after the [rats] induced clear t
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, in conjunction with cloud computing resources, to learn from IBM to supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits from the disease that they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that the vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Preliminary research assessing the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for bio-safety level 3 prevention measures to combat the living virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS was widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-Vectard (MVA-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was aware of and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and bloating.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although the symptoms are mild in most cases, viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop in some cases.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between people during close contact, often through droplets generated by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets arise when exhaling out, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the ph of a nasopharynx.
Masks are recommended for people who suspect they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Most countries in all six WHO regions have recorded local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus can be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, constipation, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat can be seen.
Symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been seen in different percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest tightness and sharp palpitations were seen.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the emergence period.
The emergence period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The information indicates that not all constipated individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these symptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained symptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating symptomatic cases into its daily cases on April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infections on that day being symptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can have a large amount of viral content.
Talking in a loud voice produces more drops than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that droplets that go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) from an uncovered cough can be produced.
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct insertion and cardiac pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause aerosols to form from the respiratory secretion and thus cause airborne diffusion.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, this risk is considered low. This virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to four hours a day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and 99% on copper.
Even then, it varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and emulsifiers are also effective if used correctly; soap products inactivate them by dismantling the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral volume on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed with household soap, which breaks down its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lunges are the most affected organs due to COVID-19 as viruses reach nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in lung type II aerodynamic cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "contact" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and it is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombose (31%) and venus thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor pathological diagnosis. Corps examinations of people who die from COVID-19 have diffuse aerobic damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing externally inflamed substances found within the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a follow-up for ACE2-reactive epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic hypertension.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published a number of testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasal fissure; however, a nasal fissure or mucus sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken over a two-week interval and the results are immediately worth less.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that the purity is only 60 to 70%.
In the US, the FDA approved the first-of-its-kind testing on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Clinical guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined ways to detect infections based on clinical facilities and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilayered ground-glass ambiguities are common with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution in early transition.
Subplural dominance, crazy paving (thickness of pet walls with variable aerodynamic fillers), and densification may appear as the disease progresses.
Fewer statistics are available about the microscopic lesions and disease body action of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: swelling, pericarditis, lung condensation and pulmonary edema in the lung cover
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hypertrophy, large unformed pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infarction and multicentrical giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Radial aerobic damage (DAD) with radioactive aerosol leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe low-oxygenation.
Treatment of pneumonia: Management of leaks and pulmonary spastic fibrosis in aerobic cavities
Blood: Circulating intervaginal scandal (DIC); leukoarythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has partially recommended the use of face coverings in public settings to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the exposure of infected individuals to large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance-making guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the curve."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty, before eating and after splashing, coughing or sneezing their nose.
Additionally, it recommends using alcohol-based hand sterilizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. Areas where professional hand sterilizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand sepsis."
Glycerol is mixed as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include providing fluid therapy, oxygen assistance, and support to other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical staff recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when procedures that produce aerosols such as duct insertion or hand ventilation are performed.
For health personnel taking care of individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in an airborne infection separation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.
Recommended equipment is: PPE chokes, respirators or face masks, eye protection devices, and therapeutic gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks if masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but some percentage of cases require.
The type of respiratory assistance for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, with some evidence that high flow nasal penetration or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided by duct insertion.
Whether either of these two offers the same benefit to severely ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use penetrating mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal pores. Severe cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's ability to handle a sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and it becomes increasingly difficult to provide oxygen.
Pressure control systems and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are required to maximize oxygen distribution while minimizing the risk of lung damage and pneumothorax associated with ventilators.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily allowed health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate threat to the life of the individual.
No clinical studies have been done on it to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contact' using monitoring data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracing and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and protect those who come in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020 Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data jointly with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency for preventing and researching the spread of the virus.
Russia employs facial recognition technology to detect violators of the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Julio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or the fear of infection itself.
"Growing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and an economic recession is an ideal storm that harms people's mental health and well-being," the BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying.
The disease can be a mild process with or without some symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as a common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on statistics from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious infection with COVID-19, but the statistics for COVID-19 are lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal spondylitis and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scandinavian abnormalities, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group have abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from displaying early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8% in men, while the mortality rate was 1.7% in women.
Tissue pathology examinations of the lung samples of the autopsy show diffuse aerobic damage with cellular fibromyalgia leaks in both lungs.
In the pneumocytes, viral cell pathogenesis was observed.
The lung image appeared to be similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or heart rate stoppage.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of people hospitalized had preexisting conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the situation vary due to those regional differences and also due to system related difficulties.
The mortality rate can be overestimated due to low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that death is the result of pre-existing cases may mean that the present mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and nearly 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term pathological symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovering.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infection provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as potential based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for the coronavirus have been reported at a date after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worse of an uncured infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin that spreads from natural and animal to human through infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was reported 1 December 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are generally used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, timing of early outbreaks, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO determined the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory. The death-case ratio divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global case-to-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of persons diagnosed to die from a disease, and Infection Mortality Rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of people infected to die from a disease (diagnosed and not diagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunosuppressives, the presence of immunosuppressives can give information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglion d'Ada, a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangetal, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not crumbling.
In the Netherlands, blood donors can be immunocompromised in about 3%, according to an assessment from the Netherlands.
There have been 69 confirmed deaths (0.004% of the population) from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have a higher mortality rate in men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only shortened by the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-differentiation are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and the development of co-patient conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the disease would be officially named "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified, i.e. December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, which are in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing degradation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory disease, which complies with 2015 guidelines for not using places in disease and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as nasica fah and ventilators.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital immediately required ventilation valves, and the supplier was unable to provide the required time-frame, a local startup printed the necessary 100 valves overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hope of efficacy.
There is currently no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First of all, the goal of the researchers is to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at generating a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system vulnerable to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-contact protein that helps the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is the Nucleic Acid Vaccine (DNA or RNA Vaccine, a new technique for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Determined to be reported by the end of April, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir in many countries, most Chinese research is working on repurposed antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, there was a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ Ritonavir and Interferon beta combined with Lopinavir/ Ritonavir/ Ritonavir.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the effectiveness of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-approved use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine already used for the treatment of malaria was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, there have been calls for equivalence review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice as many doses are extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use to protect against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicates that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificially ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further studies in organisms after indicating low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 depressed. Studies have shown that the initial priming of transmembrane proteins by serine 2 (TMPRSS2), with ACE2 receptors, is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by endocrine.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not condone artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in its COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokines in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent cytokines from increasing in volume. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completing a small study.
It is undergoing phase 2 non-randomized testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify an increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to cope with such increases, which are considered to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antibody was approved by the FDA in 2017, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of CAR-T cell therapy-inspired steroid refractive cytokine release syndrome.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral desensitization is the expected mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of a health-beneficial serum, which contains a liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and has specific antibodies to this virus, can be enhanced for rapid planning.
