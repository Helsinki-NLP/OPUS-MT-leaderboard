The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly, from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar patterns in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, confirming that even though the stages vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across the country.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and in-depth medical centers should increase their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19-infected patients, who will need health care and, in particular, ultra-skill treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown physiology was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested a new coronavirus as a pathogenic medium, now called acute severe respiratory infection coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, it was named as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far has shown that 80% of people suffering from COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 takes the form of a more serious illness that requires hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% cases, the disease becomes more serious which requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In these studies, we assessed the combined patterns of COVID-19 cases in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with the Hubei province of China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19, and the rest of the world's COVID-19 pandemic data is now following the situation in this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5, 2020 release of EuroSurveillance, Spiteri et al., suggested the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the WHO.
In the EU/EEA, France suggested the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan in China's Hubei province on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had reported COVID-19 cases, including 31 December 2019 and that date with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the cumulative number of cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from every country in the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 a.m. using official sources such as the country's health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the scope of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, for which the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK was considered for the period from January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 AM on 15th March 2020 and compared them with cases in Italy for the period from 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the U.S. and the U.S.
The overall nature of the 14-day spike of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK is similar to that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, in the EU/EEA and UK, the combined incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased rapidly until 28 February 2020.
This included predominantly reported cases of rapid growth in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK, there was a similar increase in the combined incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK as compared to cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It underlined that the number of cases in Italy had already been reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK in a period of less than 3 weeks before or at 8 am on March 15.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK are growing rapidly.
The observed pattern in the cumulative cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is growing at a relatively fast pace in all countries.
While different countries are at different stages, the gap between national public health responses and possible definitions of different cases in countries and different protocols of patient selection must be checked for confirmation of COVID-19, including the catch-up test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a condition that required hypertension therapy for 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19, and media sources have indicated that hospitals and hypertension medical centers in these areas have already achieved their maximum potential.
Data for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals and/or intensive care centres is currently available only for 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA levels, respectively (the data is not shown).
However, they need to compile the current monitoring data in a systematic manner that will focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 found that overinfection in Europe is significantly different in the number of medical and mid-care beds, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have less or more resources than Italy (by laying 12.5 per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and in the UK is related to the sample situation related to saturation of health care capacity with the risk of over-intensive therapies laying > 90%, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases are still limited to certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and UK, and since hospitals and in-depth medical centers are providing treatment to certain regional populations, information on cases and infertility medical centers should be made available within the definition of regional centres for Figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Italy's experience and the current nature of other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, hospitals and emergency medical centers need to prepare themselves for the continuing community infection status of SARS-CoV-2 and for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients, who will need to maintain health care and, in particular, emergency medical care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
A quick, proactive and inclusive approach is required to the nitrate instead of preventing delays in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as shown in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, because if not implemented ahead of time, the rapid expected increase in such cases will not allow the decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt to their responses.
Public health measures have also been listed in the rapid risk assessment to eliminate the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can further enhance their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA countries' healthcare systems will face a wave of patients who will need infertility treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been caused by the acute severe respiratory illness (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, and infected more than 80,000 people and caused a disaster for humanity.
Like the SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to get SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been infected by bats and showing similar symptoms through the same technique.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but it is more transmissible and occurs more frequently in older men and women than in younger men.
In response to the increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and inclusive review of the evolving research topic.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review will help to understand and combat this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese who were asked to stay at home throughout the holidays and for several weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of a new infectious disease.
The virus is very homogeneous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe severe respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003, so on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named it SARS-CoV-2 and associated disease named COVID-19 disease (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and immediately spread to 50 other countries across the country and around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had affected 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and possibly even more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published within two months, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7 January 2020.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in new and progressively evolving subject areas.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, Middle East Respiratory Disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as the urgent questions even if there are some leftovers.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-living pathogens for humans, leading to about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered two of the most deadly human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which triggered early outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to other countries, with fatalities and fatalities.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third COVID outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of pneumonia of unknown origin were first recorded in Wuhan by the China National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the order was issued.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
The pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care providers were reported to have contracted the infection, which showed that it could be transmitted from human to human.
On January 23, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down and all public transport was shut down.
On January 24, the first medical study on the disease indicated that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had come into direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was perceived as an early infection center from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread to 50 countries across China and around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the final state and severity of the outbreak is still uncertain.
A multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients as on 11 February 2020, has presented an updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 spreads to people of all ages, but mainly targets people in the age group of 30-65 years.
Half (47.7%) of the infected people were 50 years of age, even less than 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.27/1,00,000) than women (0.31/1,00,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly to cities in and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 days (2-9) from the time of COVID-19 infection to the time of diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjustment was R0 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before January 23, 2020, which corresponded to a large pre-spring break in China.
Case fatality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and adjusted mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large and overlapping viruses that contain a single thread of the sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoV are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) binds the glycoproteins to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then the skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the cell; after replicating the virus genome, the genomic RNA forms a virion-containing vesicle with overlapping glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then combined with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta-CoV, with 99.98% genetic identification in a 10-sequence sample taken from the original epicenter of the outbreak in the Huanan Seafood Market in Huan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through a transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in very thin areas of the human avionics satellite.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV's S protein, causing a less severe infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a new short protein, which is encoded by orf3b, and the secreted protein is encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of IFNß; however, orf8 does not include any known functional domain or purpose.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> was mixed with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the compounds whose compositions were open and closed were combined as dimmers and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to two S proteins, which provide evidence of the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and middle-aged host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted from eating cats and camels to humans, respectively.
Bats were considered to be local hosts of SARS-CoV-2 after genetic comparisons with other CoVs because the new virus is 96% similar to bats bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is unknown which medium carriers helped the virus across the barrier of species to infect humans, and the path to infection remains to be clear.
Ji, et al., has suggested that snakes should be carriers to reach humans from bats, in which there must have been homogeneous recombination between proteins.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that the long nose, worm-eating cat used in traditional medicine in China could be a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, for which the newly discovered CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 99% genetic similarity.
However, there is still a large gap of 1% between the two genomes, so solid evidence is awaited for a conclusive conclusion (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive for up to 5 days at 20 degrees Celsius and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot persist after 30 minutes in ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine.
In general, the entire human race cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been done regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Normally, when the virus attacks the host, its first pattern is identified by regression receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-lee receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-Rl receptors.
Through different pathways, the expression of virus inflammable elements, induces the maturity of dendritic cells and type I interferon (INN), which limits the spread of the virus and increases the speed of macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N-Protein can help protect the virus from immune responses.
Soon, favorable immune responses join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells induce B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, COV can inhibit the function of T cells by incorporating the apoptosis of T cells.
The human immune system, which includes components and antibodies such as C3A and C5A, is also required to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovered patients have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system leads to the emergence of large number of locally free cell groups that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in bad conditions, various organs can deteriorate and even cause death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection that begins in the group is more likely to occur in older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
People who have other diseases or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to get infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days, such as in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the average incubation period was 3 days and between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, very recent studies show that the incubation period in the population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Combining effective isolation periods based on the most accurate incubation period is very important for health care officials, which will prevent infected but symptomatic people from infecting others.
Individuals who have come into contact with the virus or who are infected with it as a general measure will often need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is it necessary to isolate the period of 24 days?
Fever is a major and early symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, sneezing, muscle stiffness, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxia after a week of illness.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and cogolopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever need to be screened for early diagnosis of the virus, even if there is a pulmonary imaging abnormality.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was as follows: fever of 98%, dry cough of 76%, dyspnea of 55% and diarrhea of 3%; 8% required ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been found in two recent studies on a group infected by a family group and a person with no symptoms.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of those people needed ventilation assistance, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and higher than MERS fatalities than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients had ventilation required.
The COVID-19 case fatality rate was 2% as of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
As of November 2002, the SARS death rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2494 confirmed cases based on a demographic study in June 2012.
Previous studies had indicated that SARS-CoV-2 had a RO of 6.47 and a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV had a RO of 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO is given in Table 1.1.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but both are less deadly.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The collective start often starts in the same family or from the same ceremony or from the same vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected individuals or have been in the last two weeks prior to the onset.
However, it has been indicated that people can hold the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again due to which there has been a warning to extend the period of isolation.
At an early stage, the normal or declining number of patients have peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with white blood cell counts, including <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L lymphocyte counts, and advanced aminotransferase levels and viremia.
The level of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin was increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte layer was increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the production of fibrin degradation in the blood had increased levels of D-diameres and the lymphocyte count had decreased rapidly.
Most of the COVID-19 patients had found abnormalities in chest radiography and were characterized by bilatral patch shadows in the lungs or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive agglomeration affect air exchange intensely.
The deterioration of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes reduces surface level and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability to circulate the lungs and increasing the risk of pulmonary deterioration.
Therefore, the worst radiographic findings are often the most serious illnesses.
The first diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed that the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of disinfectant membranes and multinucleated synthetic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of influenza and disease in the central lymphocyte is the same as the multinucleated synthetic cell with ARDS and the corresponding diagnosis and ARDS of viral infection.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate that accelerated the pandemic, medical disclosures began to be used for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020 (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation arose with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, medical disclosure, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, which uses a dipstick to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers within an hour without the need for extensive tools.
Hopefully, if the medical samples are verified, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and try using a variety of treatment methods previously used or proposed on other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments, including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and mental support.
It was also suggested that the cells of the recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly developing antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Therefore, respiratory failure and impairment pose a major risk to patients and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, the respiratory system needs to be supported to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes normal oxygen treatment, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock and treatment, protecting the function of the major organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that the additional response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients is the result of cytokine storm.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is manifested by the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which is the leading cause of ARDS and various organ failures.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody is used to treat corticosteroids and tocilizumab cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response, inhibition of IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibition, Blintumob, cytokine signaling 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect diagnoses.
However, in low- to moderate-dose doses, it is recommended to use low-dose corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, it has been found to be effective when a US patient with COVID-19 was given a remdesivir through a vein.
Remdesivir is a unique antiviral drug developed by Gillid to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg virus.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential inhibitors for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on this, Jilid supplied these components to China for testing on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the findings were very promising.
At the same time, baryctnb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment of Lopinavari/Retonavir can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other medicines used in patients needs to be closely monitored.
The production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
A patient recovering from an infectious disease has a long history of collecting blood to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that the blood of recovered patients has a higher number of antibodies than the patients.
Antibodies to fight against pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (IGs) that are produced by B lymphocytes and they identify specific molecules in pathogens and directly destroy them.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of the patient group who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 patients who were critically ill were torn apart.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced inflammation and viral pressure and improved blood circulation.
However, verification and clarification is required for large-scale use until specific treatment methods are developed.
At the same time, some of the damages associated with cells for therapeutic effects need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal in nature.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells to treat a critically ill patient is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or examine effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies quickly.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effect is largely dependent on the combination of various components of the formula according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the theory of TCM.
Most effective components are unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to extract and verify such elements or their highest combination.
As there is currently no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the alternative treatment options for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients recovering from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
87% of the patients who used TCM for the treatment of COVID-19 showed a higher recovery rate in various regions of China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province where only 30% of the COVID-19 patients used TCM showed the lowest (13%) recovery rate.
However, this is a trivial comparison because other effects such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bilal Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing only Western medicine (WM) with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the period of restoration of body temperature, loss of symptoms and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most importantly, the symptomatic growth rate (moderate to severe) was much lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM than in the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM<0x2B>TCM group was also lower (8.8% versus 39%) than in the WM group alone.
However, large-scale surveillance tests are needed in more centers for the effectiveness and safety of TCM.
It would be somewhat strange to speculate on the mechanisms of action and explain the components of TCM treatment or, if possible, their combination.
Most of the suspected or determined COVID-19 patients experience extremely contagious or lethal disease, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there were reports of persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic stimulation, malignant symptoms, confusion, and feelings of suicide.
Compulsory tracking and isolation of contact as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more anxious about infection, isolation, and guilt in family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and those in contact with them, as well as to the general public in need.
Mental support includes the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health group, accurate news and treatment plans for the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the use of professional electrical devices and the use of applications to avoid close contact with others.
There needs to be an effective vaccine to break the chain of transmission from animal virus stocks and from infected humans to susceptible hosts, and the vaccine can also be used often to effectively treat the virus to control the epidemic caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts are being made to develop a protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and effective antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Animal samples of living-weak vaccines for SARS were evaluated.
However, prior to the start of the clinical study, the candidates who were given the vaccine have not yet been able to identify the physical performance and life-threatening challenge patterns in the elderly and the protective factors against the animal-borne virus infection.
This may be due to the fact that the effects of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Conversely, the emergence of emergent cases and some of the collective events of MERS have occurred in the eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions, leading to the presence of animal-spreading sources in the epidemiological region.
Vaccination strategy for MERS was formulated using ineffective viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the problem as it requires a long time (average 18 months) to develop a vaccine and for the dynamic diversity of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has now begun to show its entire medical sequence in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any recurrence.
However, just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher dislocations and mortality rates in severe cases.
Therefore, the healthcare institutions need to set up a diagnostic model to prioritise their services, especially in resource-less sectors.
Based on the medical studies so far indicated, the following factors may be related to or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in the study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients above the age of 50 years who had COVID-19 were between 30-65 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have the underlying disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (at the middle age of 66 as compared to 51), suggesting that age is the diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Symptoms and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of hypertension treatment are likely to suffer from severe heart disease and rhythmic insufficiency.
Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE-2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that the relationship between age and present diseases is important and they may affect each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a potential long-term prognosis factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
CRP levels have also been correlated with the severity and severity of COVID-19.
Along with this, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help in predicting the outcome.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional spectators for heart or liver failure.
Major Medical Symptoms: The transient increase of chest radiography and medical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to estimate the findings and complications of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in the form of auxiliary treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
High doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, with many survivors suffering from a lifelong disability and asthma-related asthma.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and short-term if needed in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients were suffering from extra stress during the COVID-19 outbreak because they had to remain in isolation for a long time and in very uncertain conditions and witnessed the deaths of family members and relatives.
It is essential to provide mental counseling and long-term support so that they can recover from stress and return to normal life.
So far, demographic studies have shown that the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from those of SARS.
The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 may occur more effectively in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract and may cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause a cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the retention period can produce a large number of viruses during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, when patients are seriously ill, SARS-CoV is thought to spread, but most infections do not occur at an early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the outbreak of SARS and is difficult to control.
A large number of efforts are currently being made in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and keeping almost the entire population in constant isolation, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and the pandemic seems to be slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not as optimistic.
Dr. Paul Hunter has predicted that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set up a sample to estimate the impact of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in a patient's mid-turbinate and thrott swab released by the hospital two weeks ago after recovering from the disease, indicating that the newly identified virus could fall into a cyclical influenza-like chain.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which seems to have a positive impact on current policies.
It was initially estimated that Ebola would lead to millions of cases and five million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control due to severe isolation.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, will also weaken until it becomes ineffective and eventually disappears or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the pandemic of SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious by coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with the contaminated material of the virus.
The virus has also been found in the swamp, which has increased the possibility of infection to the swamp.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been caused by hospitalization, with 17 patients having other pre-existing illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, it is necessary to take great care to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and so on, but also a third of people who come into contact with patients or infected people.
The first step in safety to reduce the risk of infection is to use a face mask; both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (<0x23>1860s series) help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid points from passing from infected individuals to the surface of the material in a possible way, so that they do not infect others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23>1860) masks can stop the respiratory rate of micro-viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus being fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are about 85 nm in size.
As the particle can enter through five surgical masks each, health care providers with direct contact with patients are required to wear N95 (Series <0x23>1860) without wearing surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must also wear a fitted isolation gown to avoid contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect people with the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered their bodies through their inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers must use transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potential affected areas is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation, and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
It has been identified as an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human universe, as reported on January 7, 2020, it was the same as SARS-CoV because of the recalls of the 2003 SARS outbreak that caused the alarm bells in China.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling people that the new virus was less infectious and less regenerative from humans to humans, and that the disease was not at all difficult to prevent and control.
This message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the people, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and missed an important time to contain the disease at the minimum level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this drastic lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take the following precautions: (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word spoken is important to the citizens and it can change their perspectives and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to the abnormal information in the clinics without waiting for the formal reports of doctors or nurses; (4) be more sensitive and responsive to the public's response to and the time for the diagnosis of the disease; and (3) be more alert to the potential pandemic at an early stage instead of giving relief to the public.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which started at the end of December 2019.
Within two months of writing this article, it spread to 50 countries across China and around the world.
Since the virus is SARS-CoV-like and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused a feeling of returning to SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and the severity and mortality rates are higher among older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients do not have symptoms, the virus only infects SARS patients when they are seriously ill, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be re-positive due to the virus.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
These rapid advances in COVID-19 research have not solved many important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like COVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the medium of transmitting the virus from the original host, a bat or a human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can never come back again.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus penetrate into the cells of the aerodynamics and then perform pathogen mutations?
Does the virus also bind ACE-2 expression cells to other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the disease last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission in humans?
Is it going to be a global pandemic, or will it end up like SARS, or will it continue to be a flu?
Answers to the above and many other questions need to be found, but it may take some time.
However, no matter what happens, we have no choice but to prevent the pandemic as soon as possible and restore normalcy to our lives.
The origins of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its prevalence with humans has been stimulated by mutations and adaptations.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as colds.
The outbreaks of acute severe respiratory disease (SARS) and Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) have shown how devastating and deadly the HCoV infection is.
The coronavirus reappeared in central China at the end of 2019 with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and we were surprised by its high transmissibility, although its immunity was lower than that of its homogeneous SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a veterinary disease and therefore it is beneficial for us to understand the origin of HCoV veterinary disease.
Most HCoVs are derived from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediates are also known to be parasitic.
Identifying animal pests can have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The study of the interaction of COV-envelope in animals could shed light on important information on the COV pathogen in humans.
In this review, we are presenting an overview of the existing information of seven HCoVs, whose main focus is on the history of their discovery as well as on the origin and intercellular transmission of their animal disease.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus development and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has been discussed in this context.
In addition, the need to successfully change the respiratory tract and the impact of the virus evolution on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of inserted, positive-sensitive, single-pattern RNA viruses.
Viruses that harbor the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases of these RNA viruses are called "CoVs" because they look like a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into polypropylene to pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are classified as NSP1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, including spike (s), envelop (e), membrane (m) and nucleoproteins (n).
Numerous hereditary-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different genealogies of COVs.
CoVs are classified into four generations by different protein sequences (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which beta-CoV generations contain the highest number of HCoVs and are divided into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rats act as genetic sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main habitats for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years COVs have been constantly crossing the barrier of species and have emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
At present, there are seven known human COVs.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute respiratory infections in relatively more patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonarymanifestation.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E mutation, B814, was isolated from the nose of common cold patients.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Until the outbreak of SARS, it was widely believed that the infection caused by HCoV was generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people, including about 10% of crude cases.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula that quickly spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-NCOV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the leading cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which had killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing all the time and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming global SARS-CoV-2.
All the seven ACOVs have their roots in bats, rats or pets.
Various evidence strengthens the theory that bats evolved from the original, in which viruses absorbed the condition and are not pathogenic but show extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
The composition of the natural history, stimulus force and restraint factors behind the species' leaps in tracing the origins of animal diseases of the ACOV.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2's shelter, intermediate and proliferative parasites (Vs), which can play an important role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of animal disease, interspecies infections and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
Specifically, we focus on the following general themes and discuss that the parent virus of HCoV is usually not pathogenic in its natural parasitic glands but becomes pathogenic when an interspecies infection occurs in the new glands.
We also reviewed the art of HCoV evolution in which if the infection increases, the pathogenesis decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animals have known about COVs since the late 1930s.
The HCoV-229E mutation B814 was first isolated from different infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decade.
A brief summary (Table 1) of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order will be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E mutation was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, and since then the WI-38 lung cell lines have increased.
HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms in infected patients, including headache, sneezing, sprains and sore throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture of a small mouse and then from the serial passages in the brain.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection appeared to be similar to those of the HCoV-229E infection, which is not distinguishable in terms of symptoms from the infection of other tracheal pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally and are mainly infected during the winter season in low-temperature environments.
Normally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week after which the disease occurs for about 2 weeks.
According to a study on human volunteers, HCoV-229E has developed a mild cold in infected healthy individuals.
Acute respiratory infections are seen in only a few weakened immune patients.
SARS, which is called "atypical pneumonia" which was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history, and the etiological factor is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS was detected in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases, including 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
Without over-spreading, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a boiling period of 4 to 7 days, and the top impact of the virus may appear on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle soreness, headache, fever, particulate matter and cold, followed by difficulty breathing, coughing and then breathing difficulties.
Leukemia is a common abnormality found in the lab of larynx, degenerative liver function tests, and enhanced creatine kinase.
Diffuse alveolar damage, elevated cell growth and macrophage increase have also been found in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require an ultrasound and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected with this serious disease, most likely a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immune systems.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy by a relative of a patient who had come from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, efforts have been made for the development of HVAC systems.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially found to be more prevalent in children, the elderly and patients suffering from respiratory diseases with impairment of immune system.
Colds, eyelids, fever, and respiratory infections are most commonly found in people with HCoV-NL63.
In another independent study, the virus was isolated from the nasal secretion of an eight-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Even though it is found in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and the most common outbreaks occur in the summer, spring, and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive arthritis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and pneumonia.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma degeneration, including communicable pneumonia and respiratory tract infections.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found worldwide, leading to mild respiratory illnesses.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have been systematically accepted in humans and are less likely to be converted into highly pathogenic diseases, but even unknown causes can lead to accidents such as those in the more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have been reported to cause acute respiratory infections in China even recently.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively infect and persist in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who had acute pneumonia and kidney disorders.
Although the majority of confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases of secondary spread were reported in various European countries and Tunisia on the occasion of close contact.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Mers' medical symptoms are similar to those of SARS, which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from MERS suffered from severe kidney failure, which is very unusual for MERS in HCoV-induced diseases.
The number of patients with diarrhea and vomiting symptoms was more than 30%.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases had been reported, accounting for 34.4% of the deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to mankind.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of the year, a group of pneumonia patients with the previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of a lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with crude cases accounting for 3.4% of deaths.
China's Hubei case fatality rate was 4.2 per cent, while outside it was 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are caused by fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Some patients were also found to be overweight.
Pneumonia was one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly increase in severe respiratory tract infections.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are in different branches in phylogenetic structures.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic, it is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in non-infectious patients and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs shows large similarities and disparities.
First of all, the boiling period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and HCoVs from four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are detected during a normal HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even if the proportion is low, there is a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows the peculiarities of both the HCoV and SARS-CoV patterns received by the community.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the HCoV received by the community.
On the other hand, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases decrease in transmissibility to humans, so does the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decrease.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be seen in specimen samples.
It is to be seen from future studies whether the sputum-to-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least a few situations.
It will also be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality, just like the cases of HCoVs received by the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including the characteristics of infection, pathogenesis and sustainable spread in humans, will be effective for the ultimate future of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The HCoVs received from all four communities with mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and serious human-caused HCoVs should be eradicated.
In order for this to happen, the HCoVs must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to produce accumulation of favorable mutations which will fail the inhibitory components of the lining.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its spread among humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
For many years, four CoVs from the community have been circulating in humans, causing colds to people with weakened immune systems.
These viruses do not require animal shelters.
Conversely, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted properly to humans and their infection in humans will not be permanent.
They are required to maintain and disseminate their animal shelters and to be spread through one or more intermediate and proliferative pathways as far as possible to the vulnerable human targets.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least now, it is highly contagious, like the HCoV received from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs derived from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoVs or MERS-CoVs.
They will be completely adaptable to humans without shelter or intermediate animal habitat and will continue to see if they will spread to humans.
Before we discuss the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, shelter, intermediate and promoter Poshinda of HCoVs.
An animal can become a prey to the evolution of HCoVs if it has sheltered a close relative ancestor who shares high homogeneity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
The ancestor virus is often adapted to these conditions and is not pathogenic.
Similarly, the parasite poses a constant and long-lasting host of HCoVs.
In both cases, the vagina is naturally infected and has a natural vagina of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if the HCoV is inserted into the host just before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to new conditions and often becomes pathogenic.
These intermediate pathogens can then act as animal pathogens of human infection and play the role of proliferation pathogens by allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then infect humans to expand the scope of human infection.
An HCoV infection can be eliminated if it has not been able to sustain its infection in the medial uterus.
In contrast, HCoVs can accept intermediate vessels and not only that, but also establish long-term pathogens.
In this case, the parasite becomes a natural parasite.
Epidemiological data has retrospectively revealed that the first case of SARS has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed a higher prevalence of anti-sars-CoV-IGG in animal traders than in the general population.
In the live animal market, masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs were first identified while carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that after killing all the civets in the market, there was no more registration of SARS.
However, it was also noted that most of the masked palm civets in forests or farms that did not come into contact with the live animal market were negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civets may be intermediate breeders, but the SARS-CoV may not be a natural habitat.
Notably, 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-sars-CoV antibodies, so even the different species of small mammals can't rule out the possibility that intermediate promoters work for SARS-CoV.
All of these are seen as the last vestiges of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent discovery of SARS-CoV's natural habitat for bats led to the discovery of a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rinolops bat CoV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshue bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats feed on developing human pathogens.
Several SARS-like COVs were identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 was isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was obtained from a sample of bat stools that were exhibited to be used as receptors for bat, civet and human ACE2 cell entry.
Interestingly, the blood water of the SARS patient raised from the disease was able to depress WIV1.
Therefore, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats that share 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Although there is a high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is commonly understood that WIV1 is not the parental intermediate virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the immediate parasitic strains of SARS-CoV.
Hereditary analysis combines MERS-CoV into the same group as COV-HKU4 and BAT-CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV Poshinda receptors use dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) to transmit the virus.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of MERS-CoV is genetically close to those found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in this wild bat.
Only 87% of nucleotide sequence homogeneity is found between MERS-CoV and bat CoV-HKU25.
Thus, bats may not be an immediate parasitic habitat of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have found that Dromadary camels are seropositive to the MERS-CoV specific antibodies, such as camels from the Middle East found in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from the swab in the nose of the dromedary camel, further indicating that the camels act as the beneficiary parasites of MERS-CoV.
It is pertinent to note that generally mild symptoms but a large number of viruses were found to have been taken shelter by MERS-CoV in infected camels.
Notably, the infected camels not only shelter the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the defecation-prone pathway, which is also the main way to shelter the virus from bats.
However, the question remains that many of the confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels before symptoms appear, either human-to-human transmission pathways or unknown transmission pathways that are likely to cause the unidentified animal species to shelter MERS-CoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with bat CoV RATG13 isolated from bats associated with rhinolophs.
Just as there are cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the order variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG 13 is very good at determining the parental relationship.
This means that bats are likely to not be an immediate parasite of SARS-CoV-2, unless a similar bat-CoV is detected in the future.
Many of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediates must have been a wildlife species that was sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the earliest cases related to COVID-19, which are spectators of the possibility of an animal-to-human outbreak.
Numerous recent research based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals in distress known as pangolins (Manis javanica - khaval cats) may also be the habitat of ancestral beta-CVOs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share the homogeneity of the COV Gynoms 85-92% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 at the level of the nucleotide sequence at about 90% homogeneity.
They group viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 into two sub-branches in the hereditary tree, one of which shares receptor hostage domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, identifying 97.4% of the amino acid sequence.
In contrast to the invariable truth, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13's RBD are more distinct, although higher levels of genome-wide homogeneity order are higher.
Recent research on sick pangolins has also documented the detection of virus layers in lung samples, which were found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to create about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome.
We can't rule out the possibility of a pangolins being one of the intermediate species of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is direct pangolins due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Apart from this, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is also much shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
While the highest order homogeneity between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins is found in RBD, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 share the highest genome-wide order homogeneity.
It is widely speculated that there is a high level of similarity between the Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, which is carried out by selectively-medicated equivalency.
Pangolins have an alternative proposal in the benefit of recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The immediate origin of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be ascertained by the jury.
Even with high levels of pathogenic HCoVs, animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Historic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originate from the bat's COV, while HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1's parent virus has been found in crushed animals.
It is reported that ARCov.2 (Appalachian Ridge COV) in bats was found in North American triangular bats, indicating a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is chromosome-related in another bat CoV, named as Hippocidaros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, while the camels were suspected to be their intermediate carriers.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origin of HCOV known in Figure 1 and Table 2 is given in the summary.
The evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in history is presented through hereditary analysis.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species from domestic livestock to infect humans around 1890, the respiratory institution's infectious epidemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
A bat alpha-CoV has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
It has an alpha-CoV.
There is evidence of several levels of support for the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it is likely that humans, not alpacas, have come into contact with bats in a shared environment.
Instead, they are more closely related to humans.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are isolated and non-infectious in alpha-CoV bats, while alpacas alpha-CoV has caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV is not found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the alpacas have received the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic stock of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediate strains that can infect the virus in humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its origins and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is evident that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for the interspecies exchange of infections between genetic fragments and interspecies.
All these ideal conditions, such as longevity, colonies filled with insects, close social interactions, and ability to fly, have made bats ideal as a virulent propagator.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has entered the dromedary camel for decades.
These camels have been well accepted by those who have made them stable and natural parasites from intermediate postures.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate among these animals.
Its small proportion of humans are infected with MERS-CoV, which is an accident because it cannot survive.
The role of camels in the transition of MERS-CoV is, in accordance with SARS-CoV-2, distinct from the role of pangolins, if any, in contradiction.
In particular, pangolins beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a stepping stone for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with Udanger in SARS-CoV cases.
Future research should consider or rule out numerous possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats can be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with bats by slaughtering them or through a coal mine.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate proliferators of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus that has recently been identified.
Human contact with the virus is caused by slaughtering and eating of prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for animal and animal research.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from the different animal species, the three main aspects in favour of the CoV virus are also important in making it easier to cross the barrier of the second species.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-pattern RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COV is dependent on the phase of approval of COVs by newborns, with the average replacement rate being "smooth" to "high" while with -10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year.
COVs have evidence-reading exoribonuclease, which results in the deletion of high amounts of mutations and also in the degradation or even bioavailability.
Surprisingly, nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to inhibit these exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymers to replicate COV.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of COVs is about one million times higher than the rate of their posture.
Moreover, when the COVs are not well accepted by the posture, the rate of mutation is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, indicating a higher level of human acceptance.
It may have already been adopted by other nearby species of humans.
This also applies to the MERS-CoV as an emphasis on SARS-CoV-2, which is well accepted by the dronedry camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that chronic discharge will make immunization and condition-viral in aquaculture to a non-impact against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the larger RNA genomes in COVs draw on genome improvements to add extra flexibility in mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel COVs when the situation becomes justifiable.
This is supported by many other open readable frames and by protein actions encoded to the end of which the GNOME 3 is.
Third, COVs switch templates between RNA replications randomly and frequently through other such "copy-selected" mechanisms.
In the urethra they act as a mixing pot, the strand switching occurs frequently during the transcription of COV RNA.
High-level homogeneous full-length and sub-genomic RNAs can be re-combined to produce new COVs.
Historic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 as well as in animal COVs such as bat SL-COV and bat COV-HKU9.
Interactions between viruses in relation to infection
In addition to the three virulent aspects mentioned above, virulent interaction with the positant receiver is another important factor which is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transition events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly adapted to different conditions, especially with mutations at the RBD of S protein.
Normally, in RBD in S protein, COV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively selected by the antibody response of the lining.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is on the S1 continent in the 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind human ACE2 with them to transmit the virus.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows the interspecies transmission of viruses that are able to recognize them to different animal ACE2 receptors, including bats, oedema, rats and raccoons.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in the RBD of the human and civet virus isolates were found to be isolated, and 4 of them are located in the recipient-bond model for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The K489N and S487T mutants in civet SARS-CoV are in their RBD, which can boost the desire for the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the substitution of these two amino acids may be important in the virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein indicates that their S protein may have been altered with a binding desire for human ACE2.
Of course, a Cryo-EM study has shown that the desire for these hostages is 10 to 20 times greater than the bond between humans ACE2 and SARS-CoV-S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-subscribers are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
HCoV-NL63 may also be associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are numerous other HCOV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silicic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adoption of this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
As an emphasis on cellular receptors, the effect of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by dependence and inhibitory factors on other nuclei.
The degradation of this nutrient protein into the natural cumulative nutrients of HCOVs such as humans and bats, dromedary camels and rodents can lead to interspecies infection.
HCoVs do not have a successful interspecies transmission, and nutrient-dependent components have to be strengthened and nutrient-restricting components have to be dismantled.
In this context, the molecular determinants of this important viral-aged interaction are yet to be identified and determined.
Using CRISPR’s state-of-the-art technology for SARS-CoV-2, the unbiased scrutiny of the genome-wide and inhibitory components of nutrient dependence may be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Going to zero again
The diversity of bat COVs provides a lot of opportunities for the emergence of new HCOVNOs.
Thus, bat CoV is used as a genetic store of HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also trigger HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter the viral visual appearance.
In SARS-CoV-assisted proteins, ORF8 is considered to be important to be accepted in humans, as the SARS-CoV-related bat virus is isolated, yet degraded ORF8 proteins are found to encode.
Specifically, 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV have been identified in the species isolated from humans at the beginning of the pandemic.
ORF8 is divided into ORF8a and ORAP8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation, which promotes the migration of nutrients.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with the genesis of alpha- and gamma-CoV, in which large numbers of small recombination parts are found in the RNA.
The location of the recombination was also identified in NSP9, in most of the NSP10, and in some parts of NSP14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events in different genealogies, which have been found in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also occurred in these other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animals' COVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection can also contribute to the undesirable change of the virus genome, which often leads to the release of the virus from selective pressures used by the immune system.
An example of this is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCOV-229E prototype lineage, causing the deletion of two-nucleotide.
The unified ORF4 can be found in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOC-229E, indicating the inclusion of alpaca alpha-CoV single nucleotide, which results in frameshift.
Last but not the last, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by the pressure of selection in their parasitic veins.
Symptoms are mild or only mild when bats are infected with CoV, which indicates mutual acceptance between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats have taken COVs in a good way both physically and physiologically.
For example, the defect in activation of the pre-inflammatory response in bats reduces the effectiveness of the pathotherapy implemented by COVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by the subduction of the impulsive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression of the main osteoporosis compound Category I molecule.
In addition, both high levels of the reactive oxygen type (ROS) derived from the high-metabolic activity of bats suppress COV replication and affect the prophyrinde through exoribonuclease, thus when entering the new nutrient, the virus' genesis leads to a large number of diseases.
The more pathogenic COV hereditary also evolved in recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein features to accept nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not arisen by mistake in the last two decades.
COVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic veins, such as bats or camels.
These strong tissues replicate seamlessly without removing the immune response.
There are many reasons why the virus is spreading and why it is causing serious problems in the human body.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the high activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, while where the immune response is more potent, there appears to be a more severe lung damage.
On the contrary, in the epidemiological carrier, the immune response is detached from replication of COV.
The SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy could be a beneficial strategy to break down the immune response.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, at least the management of type-I interferon in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is faulty.
For this reason, MCC950 co-congratulations to the NLRP3 flammable material can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common method, by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arise.
Conversely, 95% nucleotide homogeneity in bats beta-CoVs was found to be shared with SARS-CoVs, even where 96% nucleotide homogeneity in bats-CoVs exist with SARS-CoV-2.
But even though the market's Udangers and other animals have been found to host SARS-CoV-like viruses, the intermediate strains for SARS-CoV-2 have not been immediately identified.
The homogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins beta-CoV has been found to be astonishing, indicating that the pangolins may have acted as one of the intermediate vessels or that the pangolins beta-CoV may have contributed to genetic secession in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either intentionally or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs that have returned to popularity.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of parasitic predators of HCoVs in animal origin and human transmission.
Evidence of the spread has shown that bats originate between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and its transmission to humans was carried out through intermediate channels.
The SARS-CoV infection originated from human-to-human contact with the UD cat market, effectively ending the SARS-CoV epidemic by shutting down the seafood market and killing the UD cats there.
For the same reason, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal infections, given the discovery that the multiple lineage of pangolins beta-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it remains to be seen whether or not humans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins and other mammals in future exploration.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromedary camel for a long time.
It is an important means of transportation and has also been a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local people.
They spread widely in the Middle East and Africa.
As has been done in China's wildlife markets to curb the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for the control of MERS.
In order to stop the recurrence of MERS, a holistic approach to developing an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels must be taken with the consolidation of other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, a new type of eczema can cause outbreaks.
In the wild, various species of animals also roam around.
In particular, bat COVs are very diverse in addition to animal potential.
These zoonotic COVs have numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination, resulting in more transmissible and/or life-threatening new COVs in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the order of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They continue to live in their natural habitat until they get the opportunity to spread their natural habitats.
Although bats have many characteristics of spreading the virus, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
To better understand the life cycle of CoVs and their natural habitats, there is a need to constantly monitor mammals, which can be useful in preventing humane transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
To put an end to this, staying away from the natural habitat of the animal virus is the most effective way to prevent the animal virus.
Innumerable pieces of the animal origin code of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, if bats infect the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 into pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological location.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, humans will have to determine how they got into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammals really acted as intermediate nymphs, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be monitored and tested for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being sensitive.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or other mammals, the SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestor virus will be identified in their natural habitats in the future.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in the field of continuous exploration of animals will reveal important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team has published the Quick Advice Guidelines for Nuclear Treatment for the Diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, and these guidelines have made a good reference for the fight against the pandemic in our community and around the world.
However, CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and experience of clinical practice, therefore, this strategy of diagnosis and treatment is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment on our guideline is highlighted and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" are provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment.
In December 2019, the 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was renamed the Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed Quick Advisory Guidelines and published online in the Military Medical Reassessment on February 06, 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since its publication.
It should be noted that although COVID-19 is a new disease, knowledge that brings awareness is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; therefore, these diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, changed some of the seven categories of references to the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines.
Now that our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guiding principles and also made a valuable reference to the pandemic around the world.
We appreciate your work and thank you for your support.
However, his work also needs to be updated in accordance with COVID-19 (Test Seventh Edition) and the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of recent studies.
As of the 7th edition (3 March 2020), any one item of the characteristic of the patient's history needs to be combined with two items of medical invention, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three items of medical invention need to be completed.
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in the city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, in the area where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded; (2) History of contact with other cases (including a positive nucleic acid test); (2) History of contact with people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (including a positive nucleic acid test), (3) Wuhan city and surrounding areas.
Clinical Inventions: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a general decrease in the total number of white cells in the early stages, or a decrease in the number of lymphocytes.
Diagnosis of confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the pathogenic or serological evidence as provided further: (1) PCR test should be positive for SARS-CoV-2 intravenously or intravenously intravenously; (2) Ig-CoV intravenously or intravenously intravenously; (2) Ig-CoV intravenously intravenously; (3) complete genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus
As we can see, the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) transcripts
The pathogenic identification of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, who have enhanced the availability of different samples, and supported to bring a positive effect of a particular antibody in the confirmed criteria, in order to identify optimal nucleic acids for this rapid diagnosis, as well as the inclusion of blood samples from the respiratory tract.
Apart from that, there was more and more evidence which reminded us to be cautious with the sampled symptomatic and symptomatic patient.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they are categorizing a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in the next clinical practice and study.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the readers to give their comments.
For the diagnosis of "doubtful hair" and "confirmed hair", we must follow and follow the latest guidelines of his home country.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports 5 new deaths due to COVID-19, highest single-day spike
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases in the country.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR's director, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mirzade, two of these cases were in the age group of 60 years, two in the age group of 51 to 60 years, and one in the age group of 41-50 years.
She also said that two of the victims were in the dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
One of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Friendship Hospital in Kuwait, hospital officials told a local news outlet, Adolu Agency.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed for a longer period than originally planned, until this coming Saturday.
The closure of public transport was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities - medical, fuel and non-essentials - is still recognized.
On March 8, Bangladesh reported its first case of COVID-19, including two people who had returned from Italy and a wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three of them had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 1 million people worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed its coronavirus-related death.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed it was one of the few countries to have been freed from the coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10.00 a.m. on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, of which 5,900 deaths have been linked.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 people died in the U.S. on Wednesday due to the coronavirus infection.
Around the world, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, postponed the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will continue to pay salaries to Russia until April 30.
Portugal's parliament extended the national and emergency status by 15 days, with the resolution passed by 215 votes, 10 abstentions, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: earlier, the curfew was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand is planning to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike Devine has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australian stores have reduced the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, the Australian store series Woolworths and Coles reduced the ban on the purchase of its toilet paper to two and one package per transaction, respectively, at the national level.
ALDI also launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted on the checkout and as a message on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, buyers are stocking it out of fear of COVID-19 and re-stocking it.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
These changes came after the four-pack ban on previous transactions submitted by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in their March 8 announcement, reported that there would be a four-pack ban, "many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery," and said the demand was "unbelievable," while ALDI, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a "great increase" in sales last week.
Canberra's Costco's store also limited the amount of these two packs to just as much as it did last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made early availability for scheduled Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said the retailer tried to increase the stock, but the local council's truck-supply time constraints made it difficult.
They expect an increase in production costs, as the suppliers are demanding, and the special needs to be met in a lesser amount.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to the early delivery of the stock, some stores will not be able to run a special on Wednesday.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said that stores are filling up stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when sold, emptys the space of a large shelf.
The Coles and Woolworths scenes showed [that] if there were a myriad of objects on the self, like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there were more of them, you'd reduce the likelihood of panic, according to ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said that his stock has expired.
According to a report by news.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply safe.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on its auction, when some auctions were held due to the fact that the buyers had time during the big weekend of Labor Day.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, eight water inserts were added, which are printed daily in Darwin, to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the store was originally opposed to the ban, in which it said it had no plans to impose any restrictions on the purchase.
Rasel Zimmerman said there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening restricted the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-rollers.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
Although the term "global pandemic" is only concerned with how much of a disease has spread, it has been noted that concrete action needs to be taken by governments.
All countries can still change the face of this global pandemic
In response, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, "If nations recognize you, test you, treat you, isolate you, demand you and unite your people in this fight."
We are deeply concerned about both the spread at dangerous levels and the severity and the inactivity at alarming levels.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published on CNN in February, he says, "No other respiratory-related virus has been tracked from the emergence of influenza to the global outbreak."
Ghebreyesus said, "We have never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus."
"We have never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The current situation of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak as a public health emergency of global concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said of the outbreak, "It is certain that the situation will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is also the global pandemic of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes severe respiratory distress.
The outbreak, which occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has started to be recognized as a global pandemic since 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 3,64,000 people have been cured.
In China, the mortality rate is estimated at 4%, with Algeria in the world ranging from 13.04% to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and chills.
Symptoms of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress can be found in cases of complications.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatments are known.
The primary treatment is to treat the symptoms and underlying condition. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth while coughing, keeping distance from other people, monitoring and isolating yourself from people who are suspected of having the infection.
Officials around the world have responded by restricting travel, isolating, curbing travel, controlling workplace hazards and shutting down services.
The global pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disintegration globally. Sports, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled, and there has been a massive shortage of supplies and a panic-stricken recovery.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed either nationally or locally, affecting nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other East and Southeast Asians and people in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and began investigations in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of Hunan's seafood, and therefore the origin of the virus is believed to be zoonotic.
The virus that has led to the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that was not closely related to bat coronavirus, the coronavirus associated with edible cats and the SARS-CoV virus. The very early known symptom was found later on 1 December 2019 and the person who fell ill.
In the group of early cases reported in 2019, two-thirds of the cases were related to the market.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 suggested that the first case of a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province could have been traced as of 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as the number of new cases in China decreased but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China increased for the first time.
Cases may have been reported in a much larger, lesser form, especially in cases that have shown mild symptoms.
As of February 26, there were relatively few cases reported among young people, with cases 19 or younger accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Valens, chief medical adviser to the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before gaining collective immunity.
Cases are referred to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those who have tested positive as per the official rules.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and official policies of many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland were such that those with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study published on March 16, about 86% of the cases of COVID-19 were not detected in China as of January 23, and unregistered individuals were the source of 79% of the written cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the number of cases reported.
The primary estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of COVID-19 patients are recovering.
In those who don't, the time from symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days and most often 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died due to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths in China were people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing health problems including heart disease and diabetes. The official death toll due to the COVID-19 pandemic is usually associated with deaths whose COVID tests may have been positive as per the official rules.
Deaths due to COVID-19 may indeed be much higher, as it may not include those who are dying without tests, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
A small amount of data from Italy showed that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, “We know that [the number of related deaths] is an underestimate,” a statement that confirms incomplete reports of a decline in the U.S. count.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first outside Asia in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported each in Iran, South Korea and Italy, outside mainland China.
All other continents, except Antarctica, had reported deaths in more than forty countries and territories as of 13 March. Many methods are generally used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and the number of tests performed on them, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and the demographic characteristics; for example, age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to the total number of deaths in a given time indicates cases.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of deaths and cases worldwide as of 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
The Case Fatality Ratio in China declined from 17.3% (in respect of those with symptoms in 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in respect of those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people (diagnosed and uninfected) who have died from the disease.
These figures do not have a time limit and it tracks a particular population until the infection is resolved.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate these figures for a particular population.
The Center for Medicine, based on evidence from the University of Oxford, estimates that the overall mortality rate of the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper side estimate of this category is consistent with the first randomized trials of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the effect of the tests on CFR.
The WHO is confident that this global pandemic can be brought under control.
The highest level and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Massey Boney of Penn State University states, "If not checked, the outbreak of infection stops at one level and it decreases when the host available for the disease is reduced."
However, it's impossible to predict when this will happen."
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, has argued that "it will end by June" if all countries begin to follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to spread for one to two years.
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until available (probably taking 18 months or longer).
William Schaffner of WonderBuilt University notes that "because the virus is so easily transmitted, it is impossible to completely destroy it," thus "it will be a seasonal disease and will most likely return every year."
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the extent of collective immunity and transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparatively specific and do not appear to be the same in people who are infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, coughing, lack of smell, panic attacks, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold soreness, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or shortness of breath. One of the symptoms that the WHO predicts is that the skin becomes blue.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms; for example, breathing difficulties, prolonged chest pain or pressure, sudden dizziness, waking troubles, and blue eyes or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur. If the disease is further aggravated, acute pneumonia, acute respiratory distress and death.
Some of those infected may not have symptoms, have no medical symptoms, but the results of the tests may confirm the infection, so the researchers have advised that those who have been in close contact with people who are confirmed to have the infection should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the possibility of infection.
The Chinese estimate that the proportion of those who do not have symptoms can be as small as 44%.
The time of actual onset of the disease (the time from infection to symptoms) is usually one to 14 days after the virus has entered the body, it is generally five days. The number of people who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% among those with COVID-19 as an example of uncertainty and then it is estimated to have fallen to 15%.
Details of how the disease has spread are still being ascertained.
The disease is believed to spread mainly due to close contact and small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing or speaking, when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it was found that droplets can travel from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) due to coughing without covering their mouth.
Some have suggested that even small droplets that can stay in the air for a long time can be transmitted by small droplets that come out of the mouth when speaking. Although the virus is not produced in the air, respiratory droplets can be produced while breathing, speaking.
These drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby, or can be pulled into the lungs with the breath.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause respiratory tract secretions to be finely sprayed and spread through the air.
If someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although it is thought that it can spread through the swamp, it is considered to be less risky.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the liver or oral. Although the symptoms are likely to appear before the onset of symptoms and spread to the next stage of the disease, the infection is most likely to occur within the first three days after the onset of symptoms.
Three days before the onset of symptoms, people have tested positive and this indicates that an infection is possible even before a large number of symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of non-symptomatic but laboratory-confirmed cases, but some countries have found the infection even when they do not show symptoms when looking for contact.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has stated that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects two to three others. The virus survives on the surface for a few hours to a few days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus can be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, one day on carton and up to four hours on copper.
However, this can vary depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Although British authorities, such as those who have been infected, advise to wash their hands after contact with other surfaces that are likely to be touched, advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, there is no evidence that the virus can infect humans.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses in nature. The virus dies outside the human body as it dissolves its protective cover with household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is originally closely related to SARS-CoV.
Its origin is believed to be animal.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus forms a genetic group with the genus betacoronavirus along with subgenus serbivirus (lineage B) with two bat species.
It is 96% compatible with other bat-related coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between the genome sequencing viruses and some parts of the genome sequencing viruses in humans.
Today, the entire genome comparison has found 92% of the genome content shared in the genome virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the genomes are the only intermediate hosts.
The virus can be detected temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan has suggested that although CT is less accurate, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR, and many of its imaging features are similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued several rules for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results can usually be available in a few hours.
The test is usually done with a sedation sample from the upper part of the back of the nose, but a sedation sample from the throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing blood-related antibody tests.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Celexini in the U.S. has only been approved for emergency use by standard laboratories.
Specific image characteristics of radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms have untested peripheral ground glass opacities and do not have plurireal fusion.
The international online information on the detection of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It is less accurate to use imaging to detect COVID-19 without PCR confirmation due to the combination of an adenovirus-like infection.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although the imagery was less accurate to detect the infection, it was faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be used as a means of screening in areas where the pandemic has spread.
Convolutional neural networks with radiographs and CTs based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the viral image characteristics.
Plans to prevent this disease include improving your overall personal health, washing your hands, not washing your eyes, avoiding touching your nose or mouth, using tissue while coughing or sneezing, and putting tissue directly into the trash.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have either restricted or advised not to travel from areas where the outbreak has occurred.
However, the virus has reached the level of social spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the society, and some sections of the society do not know when and where they were infected. Those who are providing health care are advised to take care of an infected person in accordance with the standard, care in case of contact and eye care. Tracking people who have come in contact is a method for the prevention of infection.
The use of location information by the government by mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about private life and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a memorandum to restrict such practices.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a group of more than a dozen experts were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in with other cellphones to keep the user's proximity to private life.
Then users get a message if they come in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about avoiding infection are spreading, for example, cleaning the nose and swallowing is not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after defecation or if the hands are dirty to the eyes, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus dies from domestic soap because the domestic soap breaks its protective wear.
If water and soap are not readily available, the CDC still recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
WHO recommends not to wash hands, eyes, nose, or mouth.
Many solutions such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (stainless steel surface can be disinfected using only one minute disinfectant).
Other substances such as benzalconium and crohexidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a caregiver or caregiver, all tablets, touch screens, remote controls and devices used by sick people in such areas should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing and remove the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of drops that are spread through the respiratory tract while speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO advises on when and how to use masks.
According to University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin, wearing a mask is likely to reduce people's tendency to touch the face, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not healthy."
WHO recommends wearing a mask only if healthy people are at risk, for example those who are taking care of people infected with COVID-19, they also agree that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the general public to wear masks.
The CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made from cloth in the U.S. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthcare providers in the public sector, especially when in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks for the face at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned the wearing of masks in public places or the wearing of face coverings.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going to a grocery store.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Since mid-March, Taiwan has been making 10 million masks a day, and since April 1, passengers are required to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, and it is recommended to wear a mask at home for those who cannot afford to buy a face mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves measures to control infection that aim to reduce the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include isolation, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, grounds, theatres or shopping centers.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching people and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in areas where the outbreak has occurred.
The U.S. government agencies and health departments immediately reduced the maximum number of people coming together from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 in that region is not known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany has banned gatherings of more than two people in public places. Older persons and those with medical constraints i.e. diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, disorders of the government, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems. The CDC is advising such persons to stay at home "with the aim of social distancing" as they are facing the increasing risk of severe disease and disorder.
The use of the term "social distancing" has resulted in people being completely isolated from each other by alternative means rather than being encouraged to stay in touch with each other socially.
This includes having sex with a person you live with and who is not infected with the virus or who has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspect that they have been infected have recommended self-isolation at home.
Health institutions have issued appropriate instructions on how to self-isolate. Many governments have ordered or recommended isolation of the entire population living in areas where the infection has spread.
Strict self-isolation has been suggested for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who are likely to have come into contact with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread infection have been advised self-isolation for 14 days from the last time they have come into contact.
Preventing or preventing the spread of the disease and curbing the spread are measures to control the outbreak.
Preventing the spread is done in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track those who have been infected, isolate them, as well as plan measures to control the infection and vaccinate other populations to prevent the spread of the disease.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, steps are taken towards mitigation of the disease: Measures are taken to slow down the spread and measures are taken to reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both measures can be combined to prevent and reduce the spread.
In order to prevent the spread, more extreme measures have to be taken to reduce the number of basic reproductions by reversing the global pandemic by reducing it to less than 1. As part of the planning of infectious diseases, efforts are being made to reduce the severity of the spread, which is called the flattening of the spread graph.
This reduces the risk of stress on health services and gives time to develop vaccines and treatments.
The invasive antidotes that can manage the outbreak include hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-isolation, closing schools, banning large numbers of gatherings, encouraging the society to accept such interventions, intensifying the movement of people, and intensifying the movement of people to the extent possible.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun large-scale testing and local isolation, and has warned to remain vigilant about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who were self-isolating and penalised those who were unable to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished for storing medical items. If followed by the United Kingdom and the United Nations, there are major challenges in slowing the spread of the disease (reducing, not stopping the spread of the pandemic) and preventing (reversing the spread of the pandemic).
Optimal plans to mitigate the spread of disease can reduce the high demand of healthcare workers by 2/3 and lead to half the deaths but can still lead to thousands of deaths and immense stress on the health system.
Preventing or suppressing the spread of the virus may be a priority but it is necessary to maintain it continuously as long as the virus is spreading to the human community (or until the vaccine is available, if it occurs earlier), otherwise the infection will recur immediately after the remedy is relaxed.
Excessive intervention to contain or suppress the spread of the pandemic has resulted in economic and social losses.
There are no specific virus-preventable standardized drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop them that include testing the available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids and taking rest in medical shops can help in relieving symptoms.
The need for oxygen treatment, infusion of fluids from the veins, and respiratory support may appear to be acute.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Many of these compounds, which have already been approved to treat other viral diseases, are being researched to treat COVID-19.
The WHO also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said capacity building and optimizing healthcare for COVID-19 patients are fundamental measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Department of Health and Human Services (ECDC) and the European Divisional Office of WHO have issued guidelines to take resources available to hospitals and primary health care providers to various levels including focus on laboratory services for COVID-19 tests, cancellation of alternative methods, isolation of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, and inclusion of staff by training and enhancing the capacities of available ventilators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called zero-numbered patient) may have been found.
The first case of the novel coronavirus can be traced to Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has increased in a month.
They were mostly associated with the wholesale market of Hunan seafood, in which even live animals were to be sold, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals or, in other words, the original zoonotic origin of the virus. A group of pneumonia patients caused by unknown causes were found on December 26, and Dr. Zhang Jixian said on December 27, which was treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Of these, eight doctors, including Lee Wenling, had been warned by the police to spread false rumours and another, mother Finn, had been warned by her superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a notice to the public and informed WHO.
Many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, which began investigations in early January, doubling the number of cases approximately every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
Due to Chinese New Year's migration and Wuhan being the hub of transportation and the major place or junction of rail change, the virus spread to other provinces in China in early January and mid-2020.
On January 20, nearly 140 cases were reported in a single day in China, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latest official data shows that symptoms had already begun to appear in 6,174 people as of 20 January 2020. The United States had surpassed China and Italy in terms of the world's highest confirmed cases by 26 March. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.

Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to the ban on travel and the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and advice from governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe has been shut down.
The impact on the tourism industry has reached levels never seen before.
Many railway stations and passenger boats have been shut down.
The pandemic came during the Chinese New Year holiday season of the main traveller.
Many of the crowded events were canceled by national and local governments that included annual New Year's celebrations, as well as private companies personally closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many solar New Year's events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large crowds from gathering, including farewells to the city of Faridun and traditional shrines in Beijing.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and parts extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to open until that date.
These parts represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong had the highest levels of response to their infectious disease and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations. The retail market area has been impacted globally and the times of shops have been reduced or the shops have been temporarily closed.
In Europe and Latin America, the number of retail customers has declined by 40%.
North America and the Middle East have fallen by 50 to 60 percent.
This led to a 33-43% drop in shoppers in the shopping malls during the March-February period.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed more measures such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to monitor consumer temperatures, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by this global pandemic affects more than 14 to 22 million people in Latin America.
While the pandemic was at its peak in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people lost their jobs in China in January and February.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China are either stuck at home or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that 47 million jobs could go to the United States due to the coronavirus outbreak and the unemployment rate could go up to 32%. Lockdown in India has led to the deaths of nearly 900 million Indian migrant workers (who are getting paid on a daily basis) in the middle of March.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment allowance, and one million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. In Germany, nearly five million companies have sent their workers to work on short-term work plans called KurtsArbyte, which have government grants.
France and the United Kingdom have adopted Germany's short-term work compensation plans.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of presentation have profoundly impacted these areas of the global pandemic and impacted institutions and individuals - both jobless and non-employed - on a global scale.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector tried to continue their campaign (mostly publicly funded) which included giving the society an opportunity to experience cultural traditions, keeping its employees safe in public places, and helping artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues and other cultural institutions across the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, programs and presentations were cancelled or postponed.
As a response to this, there has been an intense effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. One of the fastest-growing forms of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruptions. The Vatican announced that the religious week observance in Rome, which is in the last week of Lent's Christian repentance season, has been canceled.
Many bishops in the provinces have asked older Christians to stay at home instead of coming to Sunday prayers, while some churches have made available church services via radio, live broadcasts or television, while some churches are offering the option of driving in worship.
While the Roman Catholic bishop's territory of Rome was closing their churches and chapels and emptying St. Peter's Square, other religious institutions have also closed services and restricted the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, deities, and gurudwaras.
Iran's health ministry canceled Friday's prayer outbreak in the area, and later closed the samadhi, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
After World War II, the pandemic caused a massive disruption in the world's sports schedules.
Several important sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that "the schedule for the events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021".
This has led many gamblers to play online, leading to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Several groups of music have either postponed or canceled concert tours, which has also affected the entertainment industry.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to create art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional actual presentations and continue to share them, such as the actual presentation of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and publish their work.
There have been many online memes on the subject of coronavirus, many of which work to create and distract humor in this environment of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia, extreme prejudice and racism have been demonstrated against Chinese people and people from East Asian regions as well as hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Several countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, have reported cases of fear, suspicion and hostility.
In a February report (when the majority of cases were still confined to China), records showing that Chinese people are eligible for the virus, or that they are receiving justifiable revenge, have been made by various groups around the world.
There has also been an increase in anti-China sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on regional origins.
Both online and offline, there is support for the Chinese people and the people in the affected areas.
People from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak after the outbreak spread to new hotspot countries, may have also become subject to suspicion and xenophobia. People from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, among others, initially came together and signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries as an attempt to curb the spread of the disease.
In Japan, <0x23>ChineseDon'tJapan has become a hot topic of discussion on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing cases of racism as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," which critics view as anti-Chinese and anti-racism.
Protesters stormed a bus carrying Ukrainian nationals and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
Students from North-Eastern India, who come from China border areas and study in major Indian cities, have experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state-level president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese embassy in Kolkata later condemned the incident, calling it "defaulting". Xenophobia and dynasticism have been fuelled by an epidemic against non-Chinese residents in China, where foreigners are described as "foreign garbage" and are targeted for "disposal".
Current papers with paywalls have removed some or all paywalls for their spread of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publications have freely made available scientific research on outbreaks.
Some scientists have chosen a way to quickly share their results on print servers such as bioRxiv.
Infectious Diseases - Infectious diseases of emerging pathogens, often unimaginable in their range of outbreaks or mode of spread

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include antibiotic detection methods for detecting the presence of the virus and responding to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is ensured through RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the corona virus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to treat a recent or active infection.
Antibiotic testing can be used to diagnose both serology and closely monitor populations.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or people without symptoms to mention.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the population group.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had access to reliable information about the spread of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has conducted more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is also likely to be largely unreasonable in some countries.
A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or spitting sample.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test for spitting in the throat is only confirmed in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat, and its number in the lungs continues to grow rapidly.
During the second week of testing of infected persons, a deep aerodynamic sample may be taken by a suction catheter as an alternative or a post coughing component (suggestion) may be used.
In January 2020, one of the early PCR tests at Charity in Berlin was developed using real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the infrastructure component of the 250,000 test sets available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Cogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
The test traces the "E" gene shared by all the beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene unique to SARS-CoV-2. The 2019 coronavirus-control group (BGI) was one of the first companies in the United States to be approved for emergency use by the China National Medical Products Administration (RCC) for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kit in China.
One in three genetic test defects in older versions of test sets led to inconclusive results and hampered trials at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed each day, on average, throughout February 2020.
As on 28th February 2020, testing using two components was not considered to be conclusive, and by then, state-level and local labs were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the US began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 tests available across the country.
No limitation was declared on the quantum; sample collection and processing should be done only in accordance with the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and developed by Vector, the state research center for virology and biotechnology in Russia.
The test was registered by the Federal Service on 11th February 2020 to monitor healthcare. On 12th March 2020, the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for detecting COVID-19 infection. On 13th March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a large number of tests that could be done in 3.5 hours, thus allowing a single machine to carry out approximately 4,128 tests in a span of 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted the Abbott Laboratory Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to test the M2000 system of Abbott; such authorization had previously been granted to Holographic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, SAFEID received the EUA for an approximately 45-minute test from the FDA.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid application technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can give definitive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 such devices in the US and Abbott is expected to increase production by 50,000 tests per day. The test using monoclonal antibiotic that binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, which is expected to take 15 minutes.
In March 2020, a data review concluded that "while chest X-rays are less useful for early diagnosis, CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptoms begin."
Typical features of the CT include secondary heterogeneous lateral distribution with bimetallic multilobar ground-glass opacification.
As the disease progresses, subpopular domains, crazy paving and consolidation are developed.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less characteristic, as it incorporates other pneumonia and disease processes with many of its imaging features.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "Cit should not be used as a first-come-first-served test to diagnose or diagnose COVID-19". The CDC recommends PCR for early detection by March 2020.
Antibiotics including IgM and IgG were produced as part of the immune response to the infection.
Those tests may be used to detect infection, determine immunity, and monitor populations approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Tests may be carried out at the Central Laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to conduct these tests on a large scale, which can be processed over a specified period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although several samples can be used to track the immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
A single sample of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture for POCT.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for extraction prior to the inspection. On 26th March 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 components which gave instructions to the agency as per requirement and hence they are able to deliver their antibiotic tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the authorization for emergency use. Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics have received approval from the European Community for their test sets, through which traces of blood samples can be traced back to IgG and IgG in the background of the virus.
Some of the test's capabilities are that hundreds of samples can be tested within a few hours and therefore this test is several times faster than the virus's traditional PCR testing of RNA.
It is generally possible to detect the antibiotic within 14 days after infection. No set of antibiotic tests they purchased in England in early April were found to be suitable enough to use.
Hong Kong has devised a plan, in which the suspects can stay at home, "Emergency Department will give the patient a sample tube", they spit in it, they send it back to the doctor, and they get the results of the test in a timely manner. The British NHS has revealed that they are conducting an initial study of the plan to test the suspects at home, through which they are hospitalized.
Drive Through Centers has helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests than any other country. In Germany, on March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated that they had the capacity to carry out approximately 12,000 tests a day in a circular system and had 10.700 tests done in the previous week itself.
When a doctor is asked to perform a test, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
By March 19, the drive-in tests had been offered in many major cities.
The total number of tests conducted in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first survey in the lab found that a total of 4,83,295 samples were tested in the period up to 12/2020 of the calendar week and up to 12/2020 of the week and 33,491 samples were tested in the first three days of the experiment together with the results of the SARS-CoV-2 test.
The construction was carried out within 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian, and this modeling has shown that if the testing capacity had not been started on time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the associated cost of handling the quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Labs has been closely followed by Huo-Yan Laboratories in a total of 12 cities in China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, the total daily output was 50,000 tests per day. This open source multiplex design, published by Origami Ases, allows testing of 1122 samples of COVID-19 patients using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without a robotic liquid handler.
As of March, the shortage of reactors and insufficient amounts have been a barrier to large-scale testing in the EU, UK and the US.
As a result, some authors began experimenting with the sample preparation protocol that included heating the RNA genome for 5 minutes to 98 degrees Celsius for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country.
This was in conjunction with the purchase of a wholesale throughput laboratory in proportion to the drive through capacity and population of Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency search labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large-scale conductivity outside of China.
Various tests have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the coronavirus gene profile.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted Germanys initiative to send its own set of production kits to low-income countries with no resources to create their own set.
Germany's action was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which led to the pending trials available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test sets at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not provide enough sets to meet the demand and testing recommendations from health experts.
In contrast, large-scale testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
A large number of testing labs in the private sector were developed by the South Korean government over the years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) ordered the extension of the testing program as the best way to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The large spread of the virus led to a huge demand for testing, followed by hundreds of tests in private labs in the United States, and a shortage of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The test set developed by the CDC in the U.S. was "faulty"; the government then removed the barriers to bureaucracy prohibiting private testing. Spain purchased the test set from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioease Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found its results to be incorrect.
The company clarified that the samples collected or the failure to use the set properly may have resulted in incorrect results.
The Ministry of Spain said it would return the wrong set of results and instead provide a separate test set supplied by Shenzhen Bioease. The Czech Republic gave the wrong result of 80% of the test sets purchased from China. Slovakia bought 1.2 lakh test sets from China which were found to be defective.
The kits suggested by Prime Minister Matovic should be dropped at Danube. Turkey’s health ministry’s Ates Kara said the kits purchased by Turkey from China were “large in size” and they were “not used”. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
The test, followed by isolation of the patients who tested positive and the tracking of the contacts of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, yielded good results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of the first COVID-19 death, Italy, performed two rounds of testing on an estimated 3,400 total population of about 10 days apart.
Half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and were isolated.
By limiting the journey of social life, the new infection was completely avoided.
The aggressive tracking of contacts, internal travel restrictions, testing and isolation, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries, and there have been no stringent restrictions such as strong closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been canceled and since March 28, Singapore has started advising citizens to stay at home, but schools reopened on March 23 at a time fixed after the holiday period.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, a ban on domestic travel, testing and isolation, but through less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have found that in countries where tests were higher than the death toll, the mortality rate is much lower, mainly because these countries are often only found to be mild or with no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative samples to one of the 16 laboratories referred to by the World Health Organization (WHO) for testing.
Of the 16 laboratories referred to, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
The following table shows the impact of the country's testing policy on the "positive test" line:
While all other factors are the same, symptoms are or are not seen, the tests will be more positive in the country which tests only those who are admitted to the hospital, as compared to the country which tests all the citizens.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, means the act of washing hands with the intention of removing soil, lubricants, microorganisms or other unwanted elements.
Some "severe moments" throughout the day, hand washing regularly prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and diarrhea, which spread to the mouth.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a cold, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five most important times of the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's belly or changing the length of the belly, before and after feeding the baby, before and after cooking food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry birds.
If water and soap are not available, handwashing can be done by hand, the World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the length or after washing the stump of the child who has gone to the sandalwood.
After coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food or an animal's stool.
Medical hand hygiene is the habit of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or taking medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And home-made deliveries include a reduction in child mortality.
A 2013 study found that improved methods of hand washing can lead to minor improvements in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be mitigated by initiating simple changes in behavior such as hand washing with soap.
With this simple action, the mortality rate of these diseases can be reduced by almost 50%.
Interventions that stimulate hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third and can be compared with providing pure water in a low-income section.
The 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap, which is carried out sparingly in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the only very effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five, causing approximately 18 lakh deaths each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill about 35 lakh children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of hand-washing with soap can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, before eating and after defecation, which reduces diarrhea deaths by nearly half and a quarter of deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing also protects against the impetigo disease that spreads through direct physical contact.
The small harmful effect of hand washing is that continuous hand washing can cause skin dryness and damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much hand washing can lead to a skin condition, such as hand coughing, peeling, or skin disease, which is most commonly found in healthcare workers.
Too often hand washing is also considered a symptom of idea-action compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times throughout the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease: after going to the bathroom (tooth, defecation), after cleaning the baby’s nest (to change the length), before, during, before and after feeding, before, or after, or after, cooking raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when appropriate hand washing techniques should be adopted to prevent the spread of the disease include, before and after treatment of cut or other wounds; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching the animal's feces or after handling the animal and touching the waste.
In many countries, there is a shortage of hand sanitizers.
In 2015, a study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that handwashing in Saudi Arabia is the highest rate of handwashing in the United States, about 77 percent of children in the United States use handwashing.
The "Compulsory Healthcare Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measures of action for the advancement of children's health and education.
Wrestling twice a year, along with washing hands with soap and brushing your teeth with fluoride, is an integral part of the national programme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin was enhanced by the use of soap or detergent with water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the inhibition of solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is insufficient to clean the skin because it does not dissolve in water immediately.
However, the purification is done by proper flow of water..
The nature of our recycling is likely to be due to past uses of solid soap.
In some studies on the migration of bacteria through infected solid soap, it came to the conclusion that it was not possible for them to migrate due to the loss of bacteria due to foam.
The CDC still says “hand-to-hand soap is preferable for use”.
Antibiotics have been shown to increase the health of people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of antiseptics or antiseptics recommended for antibiotic-resistant in nature.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic components such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, although antibiotic stress resistant is not selected for disinfectant soaps, it may not be as effective as stated.
In addition to the surfactant and the skin-protecting agent, the refined formulation of pH regulators can include acid (acic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid), immunocompromised synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic benzoic acid and other synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthesis synthetic synthetic synthetic acid and synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthesis (cortic synthetic synthetic synthesis) synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthetic synthesis synthesis synthesis of synthetic synthetic synthesis synthetic synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis syn syn syn syn synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis syn syn syn syn syn syn synthesis synthesis synthesis synthesis syn synthesis syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn syn
Hot water is not enough to kill germs.
Bacteria increase in body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, soft water is more effective than cold water of soap in extracting natural oils containing soil and germs.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that soft water is not effective in reducing the microorganism load by hand.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene agent that does not have a water base.
Hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular in the late 1990s and early 21st century.
Most of them are in the form of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulation with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) or in the form of a moist liquid such as glycerin, or in the form of foam to reduce the drying effect of easy to use and alcohol.
Benign hydrogen-peroxide promotes antibiotic activity. At least 60 to 90 percent of alcohol in hand sanitizers are effective germ killers.
Alcohol rab sanitizer kills germs, multi-drug resistant germs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain pathogens (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi
Alcohol Rab Sanitizer contains 70% alcohol, and in 30 seconds after it is applied, 99.97% (3.5 log reduction is equal to 35 decibels) and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) is effective.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against germs such as norovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A lot of hand antiseptic or alcohol lords should be used to completely clean both hands.
Rinse the front and back of both hands and the space between all the fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel.
The seeds of the fingers should also be washed clean, brushing them on both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand sanitizers should be brushed on the hands after washing when the hands are dirty.
There is an increase in the use of these agents based on easy use and rapid micro-organism killing action; however, they should not be used as replacements for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers can dry the skin, so add skin softeners and/or moisturizers.
In this formula, the effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softeners.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients in clinical trials reduce skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity to contact gallbladder syndrome or alcohol or substances present in hand rubs are rarely found.
The following tendency to cause irritable contact skin disease was attracted compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not wash the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens because the pathogens remain on hand.
The efficiency of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on a large number of factors and formulations, and has historically surpassed alcohol and alcohol rations significantly.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have shown continuous and stored antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, where efficacy was shown to be reduced after repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income groups do not have access to soap and use ash and soil.
The ash and soil can be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, soil is also a disinfectant because when the soil comes in contact with water, an alkaline solution is prepared.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using ash or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or running water.
The running water is recommended as the permanent basins may be contaminated, and it was found that the water temperature did not make much difference.
Apply a lot of soap, rub on the hands, on the back of the hands, in the fingers, under the nails, and make the foam.
Soap removes germs on the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more regularly when using soap than just water to wash their hands.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The rash causes friction, which leads to the release of germs on the skin and the release of more germs from the rash over a longer period of time.
Wash your hands under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can cause contamination.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and wet hands get contaminated back quickly. Fingers, wrists, fingers, and the lower part of the nails are the parts that are commonly disposed of when washing hands.
Artificial nails and semi-finished nails can provide shelter to Polish microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent the hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost alternatives can be made for the convenience of hand washing at places where tap water and/or soaps are not available e.g. if required in the developing country, pouring water with proper holes from hanging jerrycans or brooms and/or using ash. There are options for reducing the cost of water supply (such as in limited water supply conditions such as schools or other rural areas), "tiptips"
Tipi Tap is a simple technique in which a can is hung with the help of a rope to pour a little water on the hand and on the soap, and there is a moving lever on the foot.
Drying hands effectively is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is little debate about the most effective type of drying in a public washroom.
An increasing proportion of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers in many washrooms.
In 2008, Westminster University London conducted a study to compare the level of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers, and the paper industry sponsored the European Tissue Symposium.
After hand drying with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194%, while the number on the bottom was increased by 254%.
After the jet air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the boats increased by an average of 42%, while the number on the ground increased by 15%.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the number of bacteria on the bottom was reduced by 77%. As a result of each type of drying method, the scientists conducted tests to see if other washroom users and the washroom environment were likely to be polluted.
The jet air dryer that throws air out of the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650km/h; 400MPH), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and the unit and polluting the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters long.
With the use of a hot air dryer, microorganisms spread to 0.25 m from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread. In 2005, a study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt evaluated the methods of moving different hands.
Following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared to drying paper towels.
When soap and water are not available, hand washing is an option.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
In 1846, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found it necessary to wash his hands in order to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, in which a large amount of soap and water or gel is used to foam and wash each part of the hand.
The hands should be glued together.
If the nail is stuck in the nail, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
It is important to wash your hands and wash your hands with a clean towel so that germs can stay in the water on your hands.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and open the door to exit if necessary).
This way, they can get their hands dirty again.
In health care, the purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacterials") and to prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing has remained unacceptable in many medical environments, where a large number of doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, resulting in microorganism infections.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple methods can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper on hand washing and hand-washing in the healthcare sector.
The guide to hand hygiene by the organization can also be found on their website for public comment.
Whitby and others had combined the relevant reviews.
If a demonstration of regular adherence is required, professional tools can measure and standardize hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five minutes to wash hands:
If there is a connection between blood and body
prior to the disinfection, and
After taking care of the patient. If there is an overdose of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (“medicine” or “microbial” soap) then the action of hitting the hand wash liquid is created.
Before surgery or antibiotic-resistant organisms may require such an action to be carried out in a place where there is a large number of surgical operations, hand 'towels' for surgical operation. The sterile device for drying after hand washing is a chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a disinfectant towel and a drying device is required.
All the ornaments should be removed.
For this procedure, it is usually necessary to wash the part from the hands and wrists to the corner for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long (10 minutes).
When washing, the water on the sides of the wrist should be avoided to go back to the hands.
After the hand-washing is complete, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and the surgical gown is mounted on the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands before and after taking care of a sick person or use hand sanitizer.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit of hand washing comes from the first 20% of washing and when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%, the benefit was very slight.
Hand washing with plain soap is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection in food compared to antibacterial soaps. Every 30 seconds, alcoholic beverages wash hands with soap and handwashing with antibacterial soaps, compared to 26% of antibacterial soaps. It was found that antibacterial soaps
However, soap and water are more effective than hand-washing alcohol-based liquid to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium by hand. In the interventions to improve hand health in the healthcare setting, it can be used to train employees to wash their hands, to memorize, to make hand-washing alcohol-based liquid more available and to make oral work easier.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool for achieving good health and good nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand washing taps near every private or public toilet.
However, a reduced amount of hand washing can also be a result of dead habits than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and award of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and alter the long-term behavior of the population.
For this to come into effect, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that while a society-based approach to increasing the proportion of handwashing in LMICs is effective, social marketing initiatives are less effective. An example of encouraging handwashing in schools is a "three-star approach" by UNICEF that, among other necessities of hygiene, provides schools with easy, affordable solutions to ensure students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the school can go from one to three stars at the end.
Creating hand washing spaces can be part of an initiative to encourage hand washing to reduce disease and child mortality.
The Global Handwashing Day is yet another example of an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behavior. UNICEF campaigned for the adoption of hand washing emoji as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-20.
Some studies have taken into account the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries.
However, one review suggests that it is significantly cheaper to encourage handwashing with soap than with other interventions of kerosene water and hygiene.
For people especially in vulnerable situations, such as recently delivered mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - two pioneers who first worked on hand hygiene in the mid-19th century recognized the importance of hand washing for human health: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who works in Vienna, Austria, and the "Floyd founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people believed that the disease was caused by a bad odor called Miyamas.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States encouraged hand washing more actively as an important measure to prevent the spread of the infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have created awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airplanes were placed next to hand washing sinks showing "perfect hand washing technique."
Washing one's hands in some way is the expression of one's reluctance to take responsibility for something or to share its complexity.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew where Pantius Pilate washes his hands about the decision to crucify the Jizya crystal, but in some English society the phrase came with a much wider use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, she is forced to wash her fictional stains in an attempt to show her guilty conscience about the crimes committed by Lady Macbeth and her husband.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others when they remember or contemplate immoral acts and tend to give more importance to the hand washing tool.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions are asked to wash their hands for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Using water to wash their hands, but not using soap is a symbolic washing of their hands, it is part of the ritual of hand washing, which includes Baha'i Faith, Hindus, the Tevilah of Judaism, and the Lavabo of Christianity, and the Vudhu of Islam. Religions are asked to wash their hands especially after certain acts.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Control of workplace hazards due to COVID-19
Control of workplace hazards due to COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk for prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
Proper workplace risk control depends on the nature of the workplace and the nature of work, depending on the source of infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupational activities have minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick, respiratory procedures, and regular workplace hygiene and sterilization.
Works at moderate risk of infection include works that require overhead or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected by ongoing community infections or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, areas with a dense population and in some large retail outlets.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, the risk control for this group includes using high-capacity air-filters, air-to-air play, wearing snizz guards, and personal protective equipment available if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
Osho considers health workers and funeral workers who have come into contact with a known or suspected person infected with COVID-19 to be at high risk of infection, in which the worker is carrying out aerosol-producing process or collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected person with COVID-19, a very high risk of exposure.
Risk controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for that particular task.
The spread of COVID-19 can have a huge impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to supervise others, or fear of possible infection.
In both the sense of which goods are in demand and the way to get those goods, the trade patterns may change (such as buying or distributing or purchasing through drive-through services when less crowded).
Finally, there may be disruption in the movement of goods from the geographical areas which are heavily affected due to COVID-19. Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be used for protective action.
Addresses risk levels schemes associated with various workplaces and work, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors, and risk factors of each worker, such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline contingency plans for necessary controls and situations that may arise due to outbreaks to address those risks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Objectives for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of health complications, maintaining professionalism and minimizing the adverse impact on their supply chain.
Where there is business, it affects the seriousness of the disease in the communities of the place.
There is a framework for a hierarchy of risk controls that is widely used in occupational safety and health to group according to the effectiveness of risk controls.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without depending on the behavior of the worker and can be the cheapest way to implement it.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by a worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain infections.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, they should be appropriately adapted to use (e.g. respirators) and should be properly inserted, regularly inspected, maintained and changed as per requirement, and they should be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-infection-risk tasks involve minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including hand washing on top and on the whole, inducing workers to stay at home if they are sick, including covering their mouths while coughing and sneezing. It is to follow respiratory protocols. It is to be used in the routine of cleaning and disinfection of tissue paper and waste disposal, to make buckets available, to prepare telecommunication or separate shifts, if necessary.
Immediate identification and isolation of potential infectious persons is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show symptoms of serious respiratory illness, unless they have a fever for at least 24 hours without taking fever-reducing or other medications that change symptoms, stay at home unless they have symptoms and other symptoms.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk work involves jobs for which such people are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but due to community transmission around the commercial area or the person who has recently travelled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has spread widely, she may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Esto incluye los trabajadores que han tenido contacto con el público en general, como las escuelas, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres, los talleres y los talleres, los talleres y los talleres.
In this case, it is necessary to use the refrigerator.
When a person falls ill on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping that person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, appointing a crew member to serve that sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person, or asking that sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue paper while coughing or sneezing.
While serving a sick passenger or touching his or her physical fluid or potentially infectious surfaces, it is necessary to wear disposable medical gloves and if the sick passenger has a fever, is constantly coughing, or has difficulty breathing, the cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
It is necessary to dispose of gloves and other disposable items in a biodegradable bag and then clean and disinfect the infected area. For commercial vessels including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, delaying travel when they are ill under risk control and this includes self-isolation if there is a fever or other symptoms while on the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the room of the isolated person. Whether or not an infected person is found in the school and child care centres, the CDC recommends that it be temporarily closed for hygiene and sterilization.
Where there is minimal to moderate community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as postponing large gatherings, including field trips, crowding and physical education or meals in prayer classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, changing times of arrival and departure, restricting unnecessary visitors, and setting up separate health centers for children with flu-like symptoms.
Schools may be considered to be closed for longer periods of time, along with strategies for maintaining social distancing, when there is a significant infection in the local group. The CDC considers that the immediate health risk is less for law enforcement personnel who perform routine day-to-day tasks.
Law enforcement officials who are required to interact with other persons who have been infected with COVID-19 or who are recovering from the infection are advised to follow the guidelines along with appropriate personal protective equipment, as is the case with emergency medical technicians.
In case of close contact during the care period, employees should clean and disinfect using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reusing their duty belts and gears and should adhere to the standard procedure for disposing of used PPE for a controlled period as well as for separating clothes and washing.
OSHA considers certain health care and funeral workers to be at high or high risk of infection.
Works at high risk of infection include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the case of known or suspected COVID-19 patients, if the staff is carrying out aerosol-producing procedures or collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at high risk of infection.
Aerosol-producing procedures include incubation, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental systems, and examination or invasive sample collection.
Hospital works at high risk of infection include personnel engaged in the work of preparing the bodies of persons with known or suspected COVID-19 patients at the time of death; if they perform post-mortem, they are at high risk of infection. These risk groups include additional engineering controls for conducting aerosol manufacturing procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and hospital designs.
Samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be quarantined in separate waiting rooms if they are suspected of COVID-19. Along with other PPE, OSHA recommends that employees working and performing aerosol-producing procedures should be provided with a respirator within 6 feet from patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirator masks or better should be used in the context of comprehensive, written respiratory protection systems, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and are more comfortable for employees. WHO does not recommend protecting the entire body, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread from other organs of the body.
The World Health Organization recommends that only surgical masks be worn by those who are screened at the entrance.
The WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves for employees who are collecting, caring for, or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing COVID-19 treatment without any aerosol-generating procedures.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, use an N95 or FFP2 respirator instead of a surgical mask.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows should be used, through which people with COVID-19 can directly access the healthcare providers using only the PPE required for specific work, WHO recommends reducing the need for the use of face masks for them.

We are in a very difficult situation this month.
COVID-19 is a global pandemic, and it is the responsibility of the world's humanity to be connected to each other.
We don't have previous evidence of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation, and group building that is at the heart of our organization.
The remarkable standardization of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with such wonderful people is the goodwill and care that all of our colleagues see through email, phone and chat.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to call you my friend.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to read Wikipedia right now, and how powerful it is to have this important tool available online and for everyone.
Whether you're keeping this site up-to-date or paying our colleagues or keeping your group safe, it's your work.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, much more than Airbnb.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will also have a meaningful impact on the world.
In the coming weeks, we will be making some significant changes in how we work together due to the importance of this campaign and your role in it.
Changes in the schedule of work
The C-Team met last night to discuss its approach and schedule in the coming days and months, as Robin noted earlier.
In that conversation, we considered what response would be appropriate to the one we are facing and the best way to sustain the institution during this period.
We look forward to working with you to reduce stress and help you in the long run.
If you want to do it again, don't hesitate.
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our daily working hours are expected to be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not going to announce a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can use this campaign.
However, you can't predict the world at the moment and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not keeping track of your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
You don’t have to say it, but we are saying it.
Don't need a sick leave or a PTO - just tell your managers and help your team make adjustments to the schedule and schedule, so you can be sure that important parts of the work are completed.
(If you're diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Brian at T&C Ops, so T&C can support you and take precautions to get proper attention from the management of your situation.)
Employees who work full-time will be compensated.
We have already said and reaffirmed our commitment to respect our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours.
This includes if you are sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve the stress of the world around them.
Especially in times like these, you will get amazing benefits from what you do.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to communicate with your managers so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising Teams (some of them others) perform important tasks, for which additional help may be needed.
We will initiate the process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on helping the essentials for our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done for all of us, we will only focus on the most important projects.
If it works now, it won't slow down.
We have no plan to "work twice as long as we can" to complete the task.
You don't have to work extra hours to keep up with the times of unrealistic work.
We accept that the situation has changed and will work to set new goals and schedules when appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
While adjusting expectations about your new realistic and day-to-day work schedule, we aim to adjust the deadline for the delivery of your 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees to have more time to prepare a budget to prioritize important tasks, self-care and care for their loved ones while engaging people who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of the deadline will greatly reduce the current planning workload and stress in the organization as a whole.
We will be presenting our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we get confirmation of this, we will update our representatives and teams about the further action.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, infection and hygiene
Last week, we learned that an employee in our SF-sector is likely to be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, with extreme caution, we have appointed an antiviral hygiene team to disinfect all areas in San Francisco's offices.
They use a high-quality anti-virus solution used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the shores of lifts coming from our floors.
This building adopts its own precautionary measures by using products that help protect its tenants.
We are pleased to announce that we are ready to return to work.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where we and all other DC-sector employees have shared their COVID-19 measures with us.
Last week, our DC office was completely transformed into a remote setup in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC-sector know, we are discussing rental to take up a position in Brooklyn.
We’re still in the process, but we might be late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that this will be just an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, consider how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the agenda of the meeting and send them the documents in advance.
Make this video the default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connection.
Ask someone to lead her to make every meeting easier, who will monitor the chat for questions asked, and check the list of speakers and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration with each other).
Send an email to the technical support team if you want to help.
Use your "return" to save money.
Join the <0x23>remotes channel in 'Slack' to talk to your colleagues about the assigned work.
The Human Resources Operations team is looking at 'Webinar Based Ergonomics' to help increase the work that has been distributed across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-funded public events such as "Editathons," until the WHO announces an end to the pandemic.
We told them that we understood that our request for stay and other restraints would make it impossible for them to meet their agreed grant-in-aid, and also stated that no one would be punished for delaying and changing that goal.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidance provided for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
A common sense of the entire global community seems to be both a sad but also a delight to this clarity and the ability to focus on our own community, Wikimedia and others.
As we move forward, the CRT is working to set up a page on the Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor this impact and track our communication with them.
Stay in touch with COVID-19-related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all here to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you will continue to receive information via this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office-Wiki.
The CRT will keep the page up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
Don't hesitate to notify the CRT and work with them if you have any questions about travel, ceremonies, a major workflow, or considered challenges, or if you need help with anything else.
We are here to help, support and establish contacts if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive content in your possession, please send an email to Director of Human Resources Global Operations-Brian Jundan.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment and restriction of our work.
Instead, they have to give a fiduciary acknowledgment that at the moment our work and responsibility will need to be taken up in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that, in our opinion, are essential to co-operate with each other, so that we can continue to work, provide them with their needs and provide them with the services they depend on.
When the time comes, we will do our best to help.
Now, it is time to cooperate with each other and create space for important work, which will be faced in the coming week and possibly next month.
We all need you to do this, so you need to take care of yourself and your family so that you can give your best when you need it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face.

B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells.
Resists the action of ACE2-related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the levels of angiotensin-II and increasing the levels of Ang(1-7), and therefore it is a supportive drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 acts as an entry point in cells for some corona viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-converting metalloenzyme that is on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptides M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of mucous membrane that is activated by the action of your enzyme on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The additional cellular domain of ACE2 is bursted from a second transmembrane called Shedas, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is found in most of the organs: type II alveolar cells in the lung, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in the arteries and heads, and ACE2 is attached to the smooth muscles of the arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a resistance to ACE.
The ACE angiotensin I hormone enters the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 breaks down carboxyl-terminal amino acids from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes them into vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Vil-Hyr-Tyr-H).
[des-Arg9]-Can burst ACE2 to many other peptides, including bradykinin, aceline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
The neutral amino acid transporter also regulates the ACE2 transport of the screen of SLC6A19 and is involved in heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Interestingly, the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells has the effect of binding SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the spike S1 protein in the endocytosis, and the transfer of both the virus and enzymes into the endosomes located in the cells.
The admission process also requires that the host serine proteins TMPRSS2 premix the S protein, which is inhibited as a potential treatment in current testing. This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in the cells will help fight infection.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control".
In addition, patients who were at a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, had a lower risk of being treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of the ACE inhibitor are less severe than the overall risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was also related in terms of reducing the mortality associated with pneumonia.
Recombinant Human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and this has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, the half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours, and it takes 30 minutes to start and the effect is 24 hours.
Many findings show that rhACE2 can be a promising drug for those with intolerance to diseases with a high prevalence of classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or imbalanced angiotensin.Cheated in acute respiratory distress syndrome.Cheated influenza in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobile, designed to help contact as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person ("contact") who has been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications were developed and proposed including official government backing in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to create contact tracing apps.
In particular, there have been concerns about privacy in systems that track the geographic location of app users.
Using a blue tooth signal to log in with the user's other cell phone is included in the less unanswered options.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such blue tooth based apps will be integrated directly into the functionality to support their Android and iOS operating systems.
The Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has made an app available in China to check if citizens have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
This app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. The app called Trace Together is used in Singapore.
The app was developed by a local IT community and was made available as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the Blue Tooth based app "Stop Corona" to contact potential infected people and respond quickly to healthcare officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store till April 14, 2020.
The app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks, the government said on 12 April 2020. A similar app is planned in Ireland and in France ("Stop Covid").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth protocols. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including the possibility of being less effective if the use of false positives and apps is limited to a very small fraction of the population.
While expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, limiting this to only "authorized" or otherwise reputable entities.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed deep concern about the impact of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether or not the infrastructure for surveillance designed to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have called for restrictions on such surveillance through a memorandum.
The institutions have issued eight conditions for government projects:
must be "legal, required and certified";
There has to be sunset clauses for the expansion of monitoring and surveillance;
The use of the data should be limited for the reasons of COVID-19;
Information security and anonymity have to be secured and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
It is necessary to avoid severe discrimination and negligence due to digital surveillance;
The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in the law;
The right of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to abuse;
Significant participation of all "related stakeholders" with public health experts and neglected groups is required. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters on Greensene) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of permanently removing the tracking system from their device operating system once the need for a tracking system is over.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps in which the ability to avoid tracking the need to download apps is eliminated.
Network-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; many privacy-protected systems have been created that only use central servers for intercommunication.
In South Korea, a system was used to present contact tracing that was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected various tracking information, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and aggregated potential-infected persons to create notices through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert from potential contacts, the government has made the location information publicly available, something that was allowed, due to far-reaching changes in the information privacy law after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, have considered both central and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been released until April 6, 2020.
Privacy - Protected Contact Tracing is a well-established concept, with research material from at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log in with other cell phones close to the user.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that involves both centralized and decentralized methods and not single protocols. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy - proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), mobile protocols and other protocols.
In these protocols, linear personal data never leaves the device and all matching is on the device.
MIT Media Lab's privacy group is developing SafePath, a platform to use privacy-protected techniques while collecting or using location or path intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a private technology development company originally established at the MIT Media Lab, created by Enigma MPC Company.
SafeTrace allows the user to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, using secure data hardware technology, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that originally came together around a common approach and predominantly covered protocols and aimed at enabling the functionality of apps that reduce fragmentation, regurgitation and alertness, which is the main aspect of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had released the BlueTrace protocol, which was used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy cryptography, which they claim will be kept confidential.
He also published the features of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be rolled out in three phases:
Rollout of tools to enable Governments to build government secrecy - Protecting Corona Virus Tracing Apps.
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS, AndroidGoogle and Apple plans to address the problems of continuous monitoring by distributing the system through first operating system updates and then removing the risk again in the same way.
B'Drug repositioning (also known as drug repercussions, re-profiling, retasking, or therapeutic switching) means the use of a drug approved for a disease or disease in the treatment of another.
This is the same type of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma infection for vaccines and rehab. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drugable proteins, each of which has several associated bonding locations.
The analysis of such a bonding location provides an opportunity to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papene-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicaz, S protein, and ADP ribofosphatase.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York will be conducted from March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It has been authorised under the EUA only for experimental treatment for patients who have not received approval for these treatments through the FDA's clinical trial process and who have been admitted to the hospital but cannot receive treatment under the medical trial.
"The use, quantity, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been certified," the CDC said.
Doctors have said that this drug is used when there is "no other option left."
A small study was conducted by the Turkish research team in Istanbul, in which chloroquine is used with zinc, A vitamin, C vitamins and D vitality.
A large number of studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and quality of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure is being tested by NYU Longon Medical School.
Fevipivir has been claimed to be "completely effective" from Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen.
While 35 patients tested negative in Shenzhen in 4 days, the duration of the illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir, while half of the patients received umifenovir.
Italy's Pharmaceuticals Institute (API) reminded the public that the current level of support for the drug is inadequate and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan to store it, and distribute it to university hospitals with the help of the military, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to a South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe had a formal conversation with the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug, which could be less effective in patients with serious illnesses because the virus is already there.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to conceive.
A study on Lopinavir/Retonavir (Caletra) in which a combined study of antiviral Lopinavir and Retonavir found no benefits, concluded
The drug was developed to prevent HIV replication by binding to the proteins.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Weld Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Weld Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir contains phylo-, pneumo-, paramixco-, and anti-coronavirus antiviral antibodies.
One of the problems in antiviral treatment is the resistance to mutation that results in more serious illness and infection.
Some previous pre-trial studies have suggested that Remdesivir may have high gene resistance to resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two trials being conducted at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and the other for people with serious illness.
Three clinical trials are underway for intravenous C-vitamin in COVID-19 patients with critical illness and hospitalization; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

Due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the use of antiviral drugs that were previously approved among the MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus outbreaks is scientifically more focused on the new target.
ribavirin: According to the 7th edition of China's guidelines, ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
Umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some antibiotics have been discovered to be useful for the new purpose of treating COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): Approved by China
Tests in China and Italy and Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID-19.
B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no clinical trials of any vaccine have been completed, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said in late February 2020 that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not expected to be available before 18 months.
The Phase I safety study on five vaccine candidates was launched in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The outbreak in 2020 has led to large-scale investment and research into vaccine production.
Several organizations are using the published GNOME to develop a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
As announced in April, CEPI's initiatives to develop vaccines are essential to speed, manufacturing capacity, quantitative planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists were informed that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of Phase I security studies are:
Nucleic Acids (DNA and RNA) (Progesterone I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (pregnancy I developer and vaccine candidate: cansinobiology, adenovirus type 5 vectors)
A total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the pre-development stage, with 78 confirmed projects (according to the Milken Institute, 79), and 37 others being announced and very little information has been made public (assuming the plan is or is being planned).
Phase I-II trials have conducted a preliminary examination of safety and antigen capacity and are usually randomized, placebo controlled and carried out at multiple locations to determine even the most accurate, potent doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a controlled group, and the quality of the vaccine is tested to prevent the disease, and after adequate doses are administered with it, monitored for side effects.
Out of 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still under “preclinical” research).

Some vaccines have a disastrous effect, which can also be called an unexpected result.
This means that there may be other benefits besides treating the disease.
A total of 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
Vaccines that are being developed are likely to be not safe or efficient.
Previous research carried out to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines on COVID-19 specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals and other primates except humans suggests the need for a biosafety-level 3 control measures and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures for handling the live virus.
Anti-SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine for SARS or a vaccine that is both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority task for governments and public health organizations around the world.
When MERS became more prevalent, the ongoing research on SARS was thought to be a useful sample for finding vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and the other three vaccines were in operation, all of which were viral-vaccine, two adenoviral-vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gamvac) and one MVA-vac.
The post on social media has sparked a discussion on the conspiracy, according to which the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the vaccine is already available.
The patents, which have emerged as evidence from various posts on social media, refer to the genetic order of other coronaviruses, such as the SARS coronavirus, and the existing patents for vaccines.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by CVR Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, lack of smell and abdominal pain can be other symptoms.
The duration of symptoms from interrupting is usually five days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
While the majority of patients show mild symptoms, some patients experience an increase in the disease resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 have died.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease. The virus spreads mainly through direct contact with people, often through coughing, sneezing or speaking out.
When inhaled, they are ejected and lying on the ground or on the surface, they do not carry the infection over very long distances.
It can also infect people by touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus survives on any surface for 72 hours.
The first three days after the onset of symptoms are highly contagious, but they can also be spread before and after symptoms. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the nasal spray is the standard method of diagnosis.
People who are suspected to have contracted the virus are advised to wear masks.
There are different advice given by the general public on the use of masks, while some officials oppose the use of masks, while some advise it and some say it is necessary to use it.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
Most countries in all six regions of the World Health Organization have reported local transmission of the disease.
Patients who are infected with the virus sometimes do not show symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Incidental symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or feeling of stress, feeling dizziness, difficulty walking, and a blunt appearance of the face and lips; it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms occur.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nose bleeds or sore throat.
In some patients, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea appear to be less frequent.
Some patients in China initially experienced chest pain and heart palpitations.
Some of the patients were suffering from pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some people it may be two to 14 days.
97.5% of the patients who developed symptoms showed symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. Reports indicate that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of non-symptomatic carriers in the infection is not yet clear; however, it is said that they are involved in the spread of the disease at an early stage.
The number of infected patients who have not yet been diagnosed and are being studied, along with 20% of confirmed cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported no symptoms at the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began inclusion of non-symptomatic patients in day-to-day patients from April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infected on that day having no symptoms at the time of testing.
Both spiders and reds have a high viral load.
They're louder than normal speaking.
According to a study conducted in Singapore, without mouth coughing, the storm can travel up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) away.
Although the virus is not produced from air, the National Academy of Sciences has ruled out the possibility of a bioaerosol transmission, and samples taken from air collectors in outer space of people have found positive RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as hosing in the body and resuming the function of the heart and blood vessels, may cause the discharge to flow through the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
When there is concern about the spread of the virus through the sputum, it is considered to be low risk, most of which is transmitted by people with symptoms; and
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three people. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Exactly, the virus has been found on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for up to three days and 99 per cent copper surfaces for up to four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment and varies accordingly.
Proper use of soaps and detergents can be effective; soap products degrade the thick protective layer of the virus, inactivate it and separate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as benzaconium chloride and chloracidine gluconate (a type of sterilizer for surgery) are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, red samples were taken within two days of being admitted to the hospital.
Out of the six patients, five were found to have the highest number of pathogens in the first sample and the sixth patient was found to have the highest number of pathogens in the test conducted on the next day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory symptom coronavirus that was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease center in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses associated with it in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that forms its protected bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs, as the virus reaches the stem cells through the enzyme enzyme-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of lung aerodynamic cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the original cells.
12% of hospitalized patients in China, Wuhan, have also been diagnosed with acute heart ailments, and it is more frequent in severe illnesses.
Symptoms of acute cardiac injury due to inflammatory response of the body system and loss of immunity during the spread of the disease are large, but acute heart muscle injury may also be related to the receptors of ACE2 in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Blood clotting (31 per cent) and blood clotting (25 per cent) instances in severe COVID-19 patients have been extensively detected. They are likely to be associated with untreated diagnoses. Their lungs have also been found to be failing from post-mortem of patients who died of COVID-19.
Although SARS-COVID-2 has a tendency to infect cells in the respiratory tract, including respiratory median cells for ACE2, there are signs of hyperinflation in severe COVID-19 patients.
Specifically, the pathogenic GM-CSF-drug T-cell was found to be associated with the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-drug monocytes and acute lung disease prevention in COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy also revealed the infiltration of white cells.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of guidelines for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is a recognized method of testing.
Respiratory samples obtained by females in the throat are generally tested; but discharges or spit samples in the respiratory tract can also be used for this purpose.
The test results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but it requires two blood samples made at intervals of two weeks and its results are of immediate low value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequencing, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that identify the virus.
By April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose the current infection and also tell a person whether or not they have previously been infected) were developed, but they were not widely used.
The accuracy of the tests in China is only 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test for use at the end of that month on March 21, 2020. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods of identifying infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease.
Bilateral multilober ground-glass ambiguity with peripheral, asymmetric and background distribution was common in the initial infection.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, bizarre paving (lobular septal thickening with convertible alveolar fillings) and concentration may occur.
There is little information available about the anatomy and micro-injury of COVID-19.
Some of the key features of post-mortem diagnostics are:
Things that can be seen by the eye: lung cover soreness, heart soreness, strengthening of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, overgrowth of lung cells, unrelated large lung cells, intrusion of white cells, interstitial inflammation and the formation of multiple large cells
acute pneumonia: lung dysfunction and uncontrolled discharge of the lungs
Diffuse alveolar damage is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome) and acute lack of oxygen.
Healing pneumonia: uncontrolled collection of secretions in the lungs cavities and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs
Blood: internal sedimentation in the arteries (deceminated intravascular coagulation); leucorrhythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching hands without washing eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends wearing a handkerchief in front of the nose and toenail while coughing or sneezing. If the handkerchief is not there, cover the corner with a nosebleed.
It is recommended to wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has suggested that clothing should be used to cover the face while travelling in public places to limit the spread of the infection from people who are not showing symptoms. Social distancing is aimed at reducing the contact with large crowds of infected people.
People are advised to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
It is not yet known if the vaccine will be effective in preventing COVID-19. Although the vaccine is said to be available as early as 2021, it is not expected that a significant part of the management of COVID-19 will be brought under control at this time.
People should wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after defecation or when their hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after coughing or sneezing, as well as after touching hands.
Further, the CDC recommends that hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60 per cent should be used, but only when soap and water are not available. Where commercial products of hand sanitizers are not available, the World Health Organization has given two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antibiotic action is produced either by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to prevent the growth of microorganisms in alcohol; it is “not an active substance for the germination of the hands.”
Glycerol has been added as a moisturizing agent.
Supportive care is administered to patients, which includes oxygenation, fluid treatment and support for other important organs that have been affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that you are a carrier of the virus should wear a simple face mask.
The treatment of oxygen from outside has been used for the problem of respiratory failure, but it is yet to be seen what its benefits are.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in those with mild symptoms at an early stage of the infection. The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Serious patients and pulmonologists in the U.S. have combined treatment recommendations from various agencies and given them under a single open source IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been determined.
Some medical professionals suggest using paracetamol initially instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of spread of the virus, especially in the process of producing body fluids in the air, such as ventilation or ventilation by hand, while using medical facilities.
The CDC recommends that healthcare workers who are taking care of COVID-19 patients should be kept in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) along with general precautions, contact care, and airborne transmission precautions.
Recommended preventive devices for preparation: PPE cans, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, preference should be given to respirators instead of facemasks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air but, in other uses, its effect cannot be guaranteed for a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, face coverings or home-made masks can also be used as a last resort as per the recommendations of the CDC.
Most COVID-19 patients are not as serious as requiring medical ventilation or some other option, but some of them are patients.
The type of medical respiratory facility available to patients due to respiratory constraints caused by COVID-19 is being continuously studied for the people in the hospital. The process of hose insertion in the body can be avoided through high flow tubes or bivalent positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known if any of these patients will benefit from the same treatment.
Invasive ventilation treatments, if available, are preferred by some doctors, as this technique restricts the spread of airborne pathogens compared to inhaling an overdose from the trachea. The incidence of the disease is much higher in older people (especially those over 60 years of age, who are over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, so a sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases can limit the capacity of the healthcare system while dealing with the question of hospitalization.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3 per cent needed outside ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
About 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in China had to be admitted to the ICU.
As acute respiratory problems (ARDS) develop in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes complicated and it becomes increasingly difficult to deliver oxygen.
When ventilators that have the ability to control pressure and provide high PEEP oxygen, ventilators are required to reduce the risk of lung injury as well as pneumothorax.
High-capacity PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and many antiviral drugs are going through trials thereafter.
Remdesivir seems to be the safest.
Although it will take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs that have been tested have been approved for other uses or are going through further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the effectiveness and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily approved the treatment of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine if they are effective and safe treatments for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
Based on the observational data, the app can show 'close contact' and understand the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If there is a potential risk, the app suggests self-isolation. Not only does it inform the local health authorities, but it also uses big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected patients and their contacts in Siwan, South Korea.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security departments to check the data on mobile phones of people who may have contracted the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose isolation and protect those who could come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom handed over the phone's location data to the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, which will be used to prevent and research the spread of the virus.
Russia has established a technology to identify faces to identify people who break the separation.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Julio Galleria, said he was receiving information via mobile phones.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 partners.
Estonia's President Carlisle has called on the world to take concrete measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distressed by isolation, travel restrictions, fear of adverse effects of treatment or infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor's statement as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress and economic decline are the root causes of endangering people's mental health and well-being."
These conditions may have little or no symptoms at all, which are characteristic of other respiratory diseases such as colds and coughs.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while serious illness can take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information available about COVID-19. COVID-19 in some people can affect the lungs, leading to pneumonia.
COVID-19 can develop Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (ARDS) in people who are severely affected, which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage, etc.
It has been observed that 6% of people who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 have blood clotting disorders, increased prothrombin period, and 4% of these groups have kidney function disorders.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes.
The same report states that the period between the onset of symptoms of the disease and death was ten days, of which 5 days were to be admitted to the hospital.
However, the time between the patients admitted to the emergency department and their death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time to die from the onset of symptoms of the disease was 14 days.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) found that men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Both histopathological tests of post-mortem pulmonary sample show diffuse alveolar damage along with cellular fibromyalgia in the lungs.
Viral cytophalic changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
The pulmonary picture is associated with Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, 11.8% showed high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the U.S. March report, 89% of hospitalized people already had some complaints. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affect the deceased.
Regional differences change the estimate of mortality in this situation, but also due to systemic difficulties.
Reducing the number of mild cases can lead to higher mortality rates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have come in contact in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been reduced.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and an estimated 2.4 times more likely to need hypertension or die.
Officials at the hospital in Hong Kong found a 20% to 30% reduction in the lung capacity of some people who had recovered from the disease, and a lung scan showed damage to the organs.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Based on the transaction of other coronaviruses, it can be said that immunity is likely to appear, but cases in which the coronavirus has tested positive in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that in such cases, there may be a prolonged infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural and its origin is an animal and its spread is caused by infection.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January showed that December 1, 2019 was the earliest date for symptoms to appear.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed December 8, 2019 as the beginning date for symptoms to appear.
Various measures are generally adopted to calculate the death toll.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care system, treatment options, period and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO has provided an emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 for laboratory confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and the number of unconfirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by the lab has been shown to be an indication of the number of deaths diagnosed by unconfirmed clinically or epidemiologically.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
The number varies by region. Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of persons diagnosed, who have died from a disease, and 'infected death rate (IFR), which displays the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These figures do not have a time limit and are based on a particular population infected by the case version.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can probably tell how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, a small village called Castiglion the Adda has so far killed 4600,80 (1.7%).
In Genghis Khan, the disease was caused by the Carnival Festival and spread among young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate and perhaps not all COVID-19-infected deaths could be formally classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system is not burdensome enough.
About 3% of people in the Netherlands may have antibodies, as reported by a blood donor.
69 (0.004% of the population) have confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the death rate are different for both men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that the mortality rate of men was higher.
Men in their fifties are the most at risk, with the lowest death toll between men and women in the nineties.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these gender-interferences is not known, but the cause may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender-based immunity gaps, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and lower prevalence of co-morbid conditions such as high blood pressure in men than in women may be the cause of higher mortality among all men.
57% of those infected in Europe were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not received gender-distancing information from people infected with COVID-19.
The findings found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at greater risk of contracting the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the WHO announced that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease and 19 years after the first outbreak of the disease occurred: December 31, 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a particular geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, which was in line with the international recommendation of naming, and was intended to avoid stigmatizing anyone. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Sevir Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-II).
In addition to this, the WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "Virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as “coronavirus”.
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as interim names for the virus and the virus, in line with the 2015 guidance against using the site in the name of the virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitation of capacity in the standard insufficiency chain, some digital manufacturers are printing health monitoring materials as nasal swabs and ventilators parts.
For example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed in a hospital in Italy and the supplier was unable to complete it on time, a local startup company did reverse-engineering and printed 100 valves at night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, cut-off, incorrect and distorted information about the origin, magnitude, treatment, and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly and spread online.
It was found that humans were able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that the virus was replicated in pigs, ducks and hens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
The government is conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the WHO launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the treatment effect of four of the most efficient existing antiviral compounds.
While there is no vaccine available at the moment, various agencies are actively preparing 'loss candidates'.
The earlier study on SARS-CoV-2 is being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurons to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccines have been developed.
The goal of the research is to develop a complete vaccine.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the human body's immediate immune response.
Another strategy is a sub-unit vaccine, which aims to produce a vaccine, which sensitizes the immune system to a specific sub-unit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme nerve.
A third strategy is about the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an innovative technology for the manufacture of immunizations).
In order to ensure safety and efficacy of any of these three experimental vaccines, a clinical trial of one vaccine was started with four volunteers on 16th March, 2020 in Seattle.
The vaccine has a risk-free genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent preservation has been suggested as a potential challenge to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active medical tests are being conducted.
Seven trials were being evaluated from the already approved treatment for malaria, including four discoveries on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of the Chinese research involves multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine trials involving phase-III on remediation occurring in many countries, according to a report submitted at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the medical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is in progress. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedycivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Raytonavir and Interferon Beta. including Lopinavir/Raypinavir.
According to a March 2020 report, there is provisional evidence for the effectiveness of remedial measures.
The patients treated with remdesivir showed improvement.
Phase-III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a need for a collective review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending one gram of it per day, noted that its double dose is very dangerous and could also lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the basis of the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese Seventh Edition Guideline also includes interferon, raivavirene or umifenovirene for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that high doses of raivavirin should be given in the test to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing after exposure to low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. The study aims to show that the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE-2 technologists.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major difficulties that prevented the medical community from adopting this treatment without further study. Oseltamivir did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the experiments and did not find any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can become more severe in the next phase of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guide by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
In Italy, non-random phase 2 trials are underway at the national level after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combining serum ferritin with blood tests to identify cytokine storm, means opposing such development, which has been considered to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, it was approved by the FDA for anti-interleukin-6 neurotransmitters based on a pre-existing study aimed at treating steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, called CAR T cell therapy, for a different reason.
Even today, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The research is being carried out as a non-invasive method of transferring inactive immunizations to those who need refined and concentrated antibodies developed by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
This strategy was used for SARS, but did not yield any specific results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be treated.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are under development, for example, using built-in monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serums, which contain fluid proteins in the blood of recovered patients and which contain antibodies specific to the virus, can be enhanced for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Dr Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was infected with COVID-19 and died after spreading awareness of the virus.
