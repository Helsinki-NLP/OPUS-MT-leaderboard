Rapidly spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the EU/EEA and UK, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in EU/EEA countries and the UK confirms that while we are at a different stage of the pandemic in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, other countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the cause as a new type of coronavirus called acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been referred to as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illnesses, which means respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these cases improve.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more severe disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% experience a critical state that requires intensive care.
Hospital deaths due to COVID-19 are about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of increasing coronavirus outbreaks in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK) and compare them with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, with the number in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread more geographically, and the dynamics of the pandemic in the rest of the world are now following the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues in the journal Eurosurveillance reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe on March 5, 2020, according to the World Health Organization definition.
In the EU/EEA, three cases confirmed by France were reported on January 24, 2020, from people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in all 30 European countries/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of December 31, 2019, with 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Receiving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in various countries around the world can only come from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization, which are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare it with the trend of disease in Italy.
As an indicator for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases within 14 days, and as a result the normal COVID-19 period was taken into account in the EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The cumulative number of cases reported from each country on March 15, 2020, was compared to those reported in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The 14-day cumulative trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21, and then rose sharply around February 28, 2020 (supplementary requirements).
This mainly stems from a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar increase in the cumulative spread of COVID-19 (supplementary requirements).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared with cases in Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
This figure indicates that on March 15, at 8 a.m., the total number of cases reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the previous three weeks or less.
Our results suggest that the number of cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative outbreak of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is currently progressing at almost the same pace in all countries.
While countries are in different stages of the disease, the response of public health organizations varies, and there are likely to be different definitions and protocols in countries for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including increasing testing speed.
In early March 2020, doctors in areas affected by the virus in Italy described a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had reached their maximum capacity.
Information on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals or intensive care units is currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (the data are not shown).
In order to complete the current regulatory data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths, this information must be collected systematically.
A 2010-11 study found that access to intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe ranged from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
That is, countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and mid-care per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios related to saturation of health care capacity, with estimates for different EU/EEA countries and the UK regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases hospitalized in connection with the occupation of more than 90% of the capacity of intensive care beds, are presented in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since disease cases are categorized in certain regions of the European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of an area, information on cases, as well as intensive care beds, should preferably be available in the list of territorial units for Statistical Level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is progressing rapidly.
Hospitals and intensive care units must therefore prepare for a stable transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring specially intensive care, such as those in Italy's affected areas.
As noted in the recent rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, preventive and inclusive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is needed, with a rapid shift from the containment approach to mitigation, because predicting a rapid increase in the number of cases if not done sooner may cause decision-makers and hospitals to lack time to understand, accept, and adapt their response to this process.
The rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
A brief opportunity for the remaining countries to increase their control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health care sector.
Failure to do so will likely cause the health care system in other EU/EEA countries to face a wave of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, a disaster for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS virus that infected thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted from bats, causing similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to a large number of published articles on this emerging disease, the paper seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has become an unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay at home for the entire holiday and several weeks after the outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported, of which more than 40,000 have been discharged and more than 3,000 have died.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of the people” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since its first report on January 7, 2020, in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published that identify the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
In this review, we try to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing field.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and treatment of this disease, as well as some other essential questions.
CoVs were traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, leading to about 15 percent of common colds.
But in this century, we have been exposed to two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible prevalence and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
At the same time, the epidemic quickly spread to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, a health care worker was diagnosed with the disease and showed that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, residents of the city of Wuhan were quarantined at home and public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time the report was published, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remains an issue that needs to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study in several centers on 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases showed an updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 have different ages, but are mostly between 30 and 65 years old.
Nearly half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
People with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to be male (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread to various clusters, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
The initial period to diagnose COVID-19 was on average 5 days (2-9 days).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The start-to-death period was an average of 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base serial number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the R0 set was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected with the virus increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which corresponds to the rush hour of transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (over 60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
The viruses can be divided into four classes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, which are known to spread to humans.
The encapsulated nail glycoprotein (S) binds to the host cell’s angiotensin, converting enzymes 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptidease 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus’s RNA genome is released in the cytoplasm; after the virus’s genome is replicated, RNA forms a genome with enveloped glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins containing virion sacs, which then bind to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
By genetically matching more than 99.98% of the 10 sequence samples collected from the main outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the study with a passing electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-thin part of the human lining of the airway.
It was found that human ACE2 acts as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, S protein is weaker than SARS-CoV-2 attached to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes fewer infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the virus to prevent IFN<0xCE><0xB2>. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported a full-length human ACE2-related cryo EM structure with a 2.9-aggregate resolution in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that the compound, which had open and closed contours, was combined as a dimmer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind the two S proteins together, which could be evidence for the detection of CoV and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been found to have originated from bats and have been transmitted to humans through cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing phylogenetic SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are native to SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs, originating from bats SL-CoVZX45 and bats SL-CoVZX21.
However, the question of whether the intermediate host has helped the virus cross species barriers to infect humans remains unanswered, and the transmission pathway still needs more enlightenment.
Jay and colleagues believe that snakes, which contain homogeneous compounds within protein S, have acted as carriers of the virus from bats to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, based on a 99 percent genetic parity of the CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2, stated that perhaps eating pangolins - a type of long-tailed ants that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - acted as a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference, so we’re still waiting for definitive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV survive up to 48 hours in dry environments at 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40-50% humidity for 5 days in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine, prastic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, and these can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population is generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
There is currently no detailed study of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
As such, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus attacks the host cell, the virus recognition is initially carried out by the host’s innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-like lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus causes the appearance of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity, and interferon-type (IFNs) synthesis, which restricts the spread of the virus and speeds up the macrophagy of phagocytosis in the antigen of the virus.
However, protein N in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
The adaptive immune system soon joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce certain antibodies to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill directly infected cells.
T-helper cells produce pre-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Homerial immunity includes supplements such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, an isolated antibody from a recovered patient neutralizes MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system causes a large number of free radicals to be produced locally, which can cause severe asthma to the lungs and other organs, leading to multiple organ failures and even death in the worst case scenario.
SARS-CoV-2, characterized by cluster emergence, mostly affects older people with underlying diseases and pregnant women.
The common thing is that people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune system is poorly functioning are more likely to be infected than others.
According to the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 14-1 days, but in most cases it takes 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was on average 3 days and was from zero to 24 days.
A more recent study shows that, as explained above, the incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days), based on a survey of 8,866 cases.
This is very important for health authorities to be able to determine the time of effective quarantine based on the most accurate period of incubation, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected people who do not have symptoms of the disease to others.
A common method is that people exposed to the virus or infected with the virus usually have to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which can be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath or reduced oxygen in tissues a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification, and blood coagulation disorder.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without lung abnormalities in radiology images, should be screened for early detection of the virus.
A population study in late December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms: 98% of fever, 76% of dry cough, 55% of shortness of breath, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% of patients needed a ventilator.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster induced by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
A 2012 population study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed a ventilator, which is much more than that of COVID-19 patients, indicating that MERS is more deadly than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and sore throat (13–25%) were the main symptoms, and about 20%–14% of patients needed a ventilator.
By February 14, when the number of confirmed cases globally reached 66,576, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was about 2%.
In comparison, the SARS mortality rate was about 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
According to a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate for MERS was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study has shown that R0 corresponds to SARS-CoV-2 to 6.47, and its 95% confidence interval (CI) is about 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above images show that SARS-CoV-2 is more potent in terms of prevalence than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the fatality of SARS-CoV-2 is less than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is much more difficult to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster beginnings often occur in a family or from a gathering place or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often had a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected people or patients two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and recovered and discharged patients can also re-transmit the virus, which is a warning to extend the quarantine time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, the state of lymphadenia with a white blood cell count of less than 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including a lymphocyte count of less than 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and levels of aspartate aminotransferase increased and the presence of the virus in the blood was observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased, and the C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposits in most patients increased.
In patients with severe cases, dimmer D levels, which are the result of fibrin degradation in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Anomalies visible in chest radiography images are seen in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-sided patch shadows or matte glass opacity in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome (ARDS) develop.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and advanced fibrosis severely jeopardize a person’s airway exchange.
Type I and II dysfunction in pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worse the chest radiography findings, the more severe the disease is.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed that the shelling of the pneumocytes, the formation of the glass membrane and the penetration of the interstitial lymphocyte and multi-core syncytial cells in the lungs of the disease that died due to the disease was compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used through the polymerase-reverse transcription chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate of the procedure, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical symptoms (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) began to be used to diagnose the disease in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had occurred to diagnose SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is necessary for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group proposed a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock methods to detect SARS-CoV-2, which would detect compound RNA fragments related to SARS-CoV-2 at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L without needing a cost-cutting tape (from 10 to 100 copies per microlitre of these input items) with a cost-cutable bar of 1 to 10 to 10 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 mol/L <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97> <0xC3><0x97>
There is hope that the new method, if confirmed in clinical samples, could dramatically increase accuracy and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience with this new type of CoV, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while various treatments used to improve other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases have been proposed (Table 2.2).
These include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, steroids, plasma intake from improved patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma received from improved patients was suggested for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and is likely to have weaker attacks on other organs that have ACE2, such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and dysfunction of the respiratory system are the most important risk in patients’ lurking and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is vital to alleviating the symptoms of the disease and saves a person’s life, depending on the severity of the disease, which can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilator, and invasive mechanical ventilator.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified heart bypass technique used to treat heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, it is essential to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent and treat secondary infection and septic shock, and protect vital organ function in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storms have been found to result from overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
This cytokine induces immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immune suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other treatments for immune system suppression in order to prevent cytokine storm include modulating the immune response led by T-cells; blocking IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; belintotumb; suppressor of sending symptoms of cytokine 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressive drugs were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the use of steroids at high doses in severe lung damage was not helpful in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
It may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, and can significantly negatively affect the healing of the disease.
However, short courses of corticosteroid use at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for COVID-19 patients who are in critical condition.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been approved for this disease.
However, intravenous interference with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, the possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses, was demonstrated by remdesivir.
Accordingly, Gilead has sent the compound to China to conduct a series of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects can occur after combined treatment with lopinavir/ritavir.
Interactions with other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma intake from patients improved and antibody production
Obtaining blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease has a long history of using it to help treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy people from developing the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have relatively large antibodies in their blood to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) that are produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign objects, detecting unique molecules in pathogens and neutralizing them directly.
Accordingly, plasma was obtained from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before specific treatments are offered, the use of this method on a large scale requires confirmation and clarity.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma to treat patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce fast enough antibodies to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic code that encodes antibodies or screens antibodies that are effective against the virus's main proteins is more important and more practical.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the composition of different components in the formula, which vary depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its effective components are still unknown or ambiguous, as it is difficult to extract and validate these components or their optimal composition.
Currently, TCM has become one of the most important treatments for patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from difficult stages due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rates of treatment for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China, where 87% of patients used TCM, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%). In Hubei province, where only 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the lowest treatment rate was observed (13%).
However, this comparison is not entirely correct, as many factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be considered in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western therapies (WM) alone and the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed to recover from body temperature, disappearance of symptoms, and hospitalization in the group treated with WM<0x2B>TCM was significantly shorter than the group treated only with WM.
Surprisingly, the rate of worsening of disease symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM<0x2B>TCM group was lower than in the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM<0x2B>TCM group was lower than in the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficiency and safety of TCM is still waiting for better-controlled trials on larger scales and more centers.
Determining the mechanism of action and identifying the effective components of the TCM treatment method or their compounds, if possible, is also a topic that has sparked scientists’ curiosity.
Suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 patients often fear the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia (lack of oxygen in body tissues), cough, and treatment side effects such as corticosteroid insomnia can lead to more mental anxiety.
In the first stage of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric complications have been reported, including severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor emotions, psychological symptoms, delusions, and even suicide.
Mandatory and quarantine contact tracing, as part of the public health system's approach to combating the spread of the COVID-19 virus, can make people anxious and guilty of the effects of being infected, quarantined, and stigmatized among their family and friends.
Therefore, psychotherapeutic care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, people in contact with them as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of mental health teams from different disciplines, transparent communication with regular and detailed updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to break the chain of transmission from infected populations of livestock and humans to susceptible hosts and are often used as a complementary method for antiviral treatment in controlling infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on S protein to produce strong and lasting neutralizing antibodies or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Weak live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the impact of these vaccines on older adults and their strict malignant models and protection against viral infections shared between humans and animals should be determined before the start of the clinical study.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Conversely, scattered cases and clusters of MERS continue to be seen in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of sources of animal-to-human transmission in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been proposed using passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral carriers, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some of them have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for uninsured people is a vital task to control the epidemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome this problem because of the long period of time it takes to produce a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes of different CoV strains.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to show a full clinical course among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 virus has also been linked to high complication and mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, creating a disease flow predictor model is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited facilities.
According to clinical studies so far reported, the following factors can influence the forecast of the flow of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important predictor of SARS flow, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs between the ages of 30 and 65; a study of 8,866 patients found that 47.4% of patients were over the age of 50.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and abnormalities, and were older than those who did not need intensive care (the average age of the first group was 66 and the average age of the second group was 51). This indicates that age as a predictor factor in the course of disease and outcome determination in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Previous Diseases and Complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care were more likely to have acute heart and arrhythmia damage.
Heart events were also the main cause of death for SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, leading to liver impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interact with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or damage in the tissue and have been suggested as a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
CRP levels have also been suggested to correlate with the severity and predictive flow of COVID-19 disease.
In addition, increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
These enzymes are widely present in several organs, especially in their heart and liver, and are released as a result of tissue damage.
Hence, they are considered as traditional signs of heart or liver disorders.
Main Clinical Symptoms: To predict the results and complications of COVID-19, chest radiography and the progress of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune system suppressors that are commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many recovered people suffer from vascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and reduced quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, the steroid should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As explained above, many patients have been suffering from extreme stress since the COVID-19 outbreak, as they have often been quarantined for long periods of time and have experienced severe uncertainty, witnessing the death of close family members and roommate patients.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to helping these patients recover, relieve stress, and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2, in addition to proliferation in the lower respiratory tract, can effectively proliferate in the upper respiratory tract and have mild or negligible symptoms in the first stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause a common cold.
Therefore, patients in the first stage or incubation period can produce many viruses during daily activities, which can make it harder to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were severely ill and did not occur in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 is much more severe than the spread of SARS and is more difficult to control.
Many efforts are currently underway in China, including a ban on evictions in the city of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and a continuous quarantine of nearly the entire population in the hope of cutting off the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward trend will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be fundamentally more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues set a model for predicting the outcome of the pandemic, believing that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the middle-tenth swab of the nose and throat swab of patients who had left the hospital two weeks earlier and recovered, suggesting that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, there have been promising signs in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may work.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would kill one million people and kill half a million people.
However, through intensive quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become pathogenically weaker and eventually die or become a low pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted to the virus through direct contact with contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in stools, which allow transmission from stool to mouth.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by a hospital infection, which included 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, it is important to be very careful in protecting people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even travelers who are in contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks, which can be done through both surgical masks and N95 respirators, which help control the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask prevents the passage of liquid droplets spread by potentially infected people through the air or sticking to the surface of the material where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (1860 series) can protect a person from inhaling virus particles as large as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus particles can pass through them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can pass even among the five surgical masks put together, health care workers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care staff should wear isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care workers should also wear transparent shields and glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in contaminated or potentially contaminated areas, it is highly recommended that people wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soaps and try to stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet (one meter) is considered to be the right distance for people who stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, its high parity with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, was an important warning for China based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control comforted citizens by stating that the new virus was less contagious, limited to human-to-human transmission, and that there was no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly reduced awareness of the danger among the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the crucial time to contain the disease on a minimal scale was lost in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned a hard lesson from this and will make major improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be more sensitive and responsive to (i) considering that every word spoken by health organizations is important to citizens and can change people’s attitudes and decisions; (ii) they should be more sensitive and responsive to (iii) the public’s responses to (iii) the public’s responses, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and authorities; (iv) they should be more sensitive to (iii) the public’s response to (iii) the public’s attempts to be more effective.
The outbreak of COVID-19 by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months and at the time of writing, the virus has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and has similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are higher in older people than young people.
SARS was more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS transmit the virus when they become severely ill, making it harder to contain COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread more and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Normal RNA testing in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can re-infect the virus and the test results are positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Due to such rapid progress in COVID-19-related research, several important issues remain unresolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-CoVs, like bats, there is an estimated 96% genetic homogeneity, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
Which animal, as an intermediary, transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop transmission and the outbreak may recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical measurements have determined that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent disease-related changes?
Is the virus attached to cells with ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the spread continue?
How is the virus genetically modified during human transmission?
Will the disease become a worldwide epidemic, such as SARS-CoV-2, or will it return periodically, such as the flu?
Answering the above questions is essential, but it may take some time to get to the answers to the above questions and many more.
However, at any cost that may be necessary, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The origins of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, adaptation and adaptation have led to the simultaneous evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as a cold.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed on the coin how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put CoVs back in the spotlight and surprised us with its high prevalence, but the symptoms were less severe compared to her sister, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common disease between humans and animals, and identifying the animal origin of HCoVs is a great help.
Most HCoVs are bats that do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as the intermediate reservoir of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct impact on disease prevention in humans.
Studying CoV host interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge available about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
The important thing we’re going to look at is to compare different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genetic recombination.
The current coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) is being discussed in this context.
In addition, the need to successfully change the host and the evolution of the virus for the severity of the disease is discussed in this article.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped viruses, with positive polarity and single-stranded RNA.
These viruses, which have the largest genome from 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses, were called "CoVs," due to their crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have an integrated genome that shares a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed and produce 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1-16.
The remaining part of the genome consists of ORFs used for structural proteins such as Spike (S), Wrap (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprene (N).
A number of lateral proteins that are ancestor-specific are encoded by different CoV ancestors.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are categorized into four sexes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV sex is most HCoVs and is divided into four races (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as gene sources for alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV variants.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in most patients and most likely causing acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and the appearance of symptoms outside the lungs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, called B814, was isolated from the nasal discharges of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, our knowledge has grown through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that it was generally harmless to get HCoVs until SARS spread.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003, one of the most devastating outbreaks at the moment, infecting more than 8,000 people, with crude losses of nearly 10 percent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused an outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the rest of the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, became the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have animal origins, including bats, mice, or pets.
There is a number of evidence that all HCoVs are evolutionary origins from bats, in these organisms the viruses are well adapted, are symptom-free and show a great deal of genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of the disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, triggering and limiting mutations of species.
It may also facilitate repository search, intermediate host and animal hosts boosting SARS-CoV-2 and have important implications in preventing future pandemics.
In this review, we will review the animal origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Specifically, we highlight and discuss this common theme in which the parent HCoVs in their natural habitat are not typically pathogens, but are pathogens after being transferred between species to the new host.
We also examine the evolution of HCoVs, where the increase in the spread of the virus is often associated with a decrease in pathogenesis.
The implications of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are currently being discussed in this context as well.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, from the nasal discharges of patients with a common cold, different CoVs were isolated in a variety of animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the date of HCoV discovery in chronological order (table 1) can be informative and contain good information.
In 1966, the first sequence of HCoV-229E virus was sampled from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection, and then adapted for growth in the WI-38 lung cell culture.
Patients with HCoV-229E had symptoms of a common cold, including headaches, sneezing, weakness, and sore throat, and fever and cough were seen in 10 to 20 percent of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory and gradually entered the brains of small mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those developed by HCoV-229E, which are not distinguishable from other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses in terms of symptoms.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 have both spread globally and are mainly transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, and after that, the disease lasts approximately two weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E had a mild cold.
Only a few patients with immunodeficiency were diagnosed with a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS disease, also known as "the future lung of the peak," is the first pandemic in human history to cause SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS outbreak caused 8,096 deaths, 774 deaths, and spread to many countries and continents.
With the exception of exceptional cases of spread, it is estimated that each case can infect approximately two others, with the incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, fever, weakness and tremor, and then shortness of breath, cough and respiratory dystrophy appeared as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopathy, defective liver function testing and increased kinase seratin are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.
Extensive aloe vera destruction, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20 to 30 percent of patients needed special care and mechanical ventilators.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the digestive tract, liver, and kidney, were affected in acute cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that could have been fatal, especially in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first biopsied during a lung biopsy by a relative of an index patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, older patients, and people with respiratory illnesses.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
In another independent study, the same virus isolates from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was detected in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7 percent of chronic respiratory diseases, and peak outbreaks occur in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngeal inflammation, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma aggravation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, the HCoV-HKU1 virus has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
These four community-transmitted families have adapted well to humans and are generally less prone to severe illnesses, although cases occur for unknown reasons, for example in a rare case recently reported, the malignant HCoV-NL63 variant has caused a lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves continuously in humans, the severity of virulence or pathogenesis decreases.
MERS-CoV was isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
While the majority of confirmed cases of the virus originate from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported with secondary outbreaks due to close contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak in South Korea was confirmed in 2015 with 186 cases.
The clinical appearance of MERS is similar to that of SARS, known as progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had acute renal failure, which is specific to MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients had digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with high fatalities at 34.4 percent, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid- to late-December 2019, clusters of patients with infectious diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global public health emergency due to SARS-CoV-2, calling it COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 90,053, and the percentage of raw fatalities was 3.4 percent.
It is noteworthy that the number of deaths in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while outside it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes severe respiratory infections that are seen as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% of nucleotide sequences, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
Some people with SARS-CoV-2 were reported to have no symptoms, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs show significant similarities and differences.
The first is that the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is the middle of SARS-CoV and four community-transmitted HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features commonly seen in community-transmitted HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild, or even in some cases without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of acute COVID-19 cases can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting patterns of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs transmitted from the community.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as transmissible as community-transmitted HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission capability, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, decreases after multiple transmissions between humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine, such as SARS-CoV, plays an important role in transmission, at least in some circumstances, should be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonal, similar to community-transmitted HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread after transmission from person to person, will affect the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four of the community-transmitted HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and people who have been infected with severe HCoV diseases are now extinct.
For this purpose, HCoVs must be reproduced in humans sufficiently to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host limiting factors.
In this case, the more the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people get the disease, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent transmission in humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four CoVs acquired from the community have circulated in human communities, causing a common cold in people with a healthy immune system.
These viruses do not need an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
These viruses need to be kept and spread in their animal reservoirs and are looking for opportunities to infect susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and boosters.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four community-derived HCoVs.
Like community-transmitted HCoVs, the virus is highly transmissible, at least for the time being.
However, its pathogenicity is lower than community-transmitted HCoVs and higher than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
We will have to wait and see if the virus fully adapts to humans and is transmitted between humans without an intermediate (reservoir) or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir hosts, intermediate hosts and replicators of HCoVs.
If the animal is a close ancestor of a virus that has high homogeneity at the level of nucleotide sequence, the animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is not pathogenic to it.
As such, a reservoir host provides shelter to HCoVs, uninterrupted and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoVs or its parent viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV interacts before infecting humans, or about the same time as the host, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal reservoir of human infection, and in the role of replicating hosts, by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and then transmit it to humans, increasing the level of infection in humans.
HCoV can cause deadly infections if it fails to keep its transmission stable in the middle host.
Conversely, HCoVs can adapt to the middle host and are even long-term in the host group.
In this case, the intermediate host acts as a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data suggests that the first person infected with SARS was dealing with predatory animals.
Subsequent studies show that levels of immunoglobulin G anti-SARS are higher in animal products vendors than in normal people.
For the first time, a number of masked palm crabs (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in the live animal market carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses were identified, almost identical to SARS-CoV.
A 29-nucleotide elimination feature for SARS-CoV has been found in races taken at the onset of the human epidemic.
At the same time, it has been reported that forest-dwelling or farms that were not marketed on the live animal market were largely negative in terms of the presence of the SARS-CoV virus. This suggests that the masked palm-dwelling is probably just the intermediate host and not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate booster hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these seem to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
In a subsequent search for a natural animal host, SARS-CoV, a variant of the coronavirus that was closely related to bat CoV, called the SARS-linked HKU3 coronavirus, the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 bat, was found to live in a Chinese horseman's bark bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This virus and other bat CoVs are 88-92% similar in nucleotide sequence to SARS-CoV.
These studies became the basis for a new theory that says bats host new human pathogen viruses.
A number of SARS-like viruses (SL-CoVs) were also detected in bats, but none were able to isolate them alive except for WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, derived from bat stools, showed that ACE2 was used by bats, civets and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of recovered SARS patients had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% nucleonid sequence similarity.
Although there is a large correlation between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and bats, not the host of the SARS-CoV immediate reservoir.
The phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV with similar groups such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase sequences are more phylogenetically close to bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25 virus, are only 87 percent similar in terms of nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats cannot host the MERS-CoV immediate reservoir.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that a mountain camel is positive in terms of its proprietary MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, the same holds true for the Middle East camels in the African country.
The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was sampled from the nose of a camel in a mountain and showed that camels host the true reservoir of MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that generally mild and highly transmissible symptoms of the virus have been observed in camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through feces – the mouth, which is also the main method of transmitting the virus in bats.
However, one of the questions that remains unanswered since then is that in many cases, MERS confirmed there was no history of camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms, which is likely to be attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide sequence similar to CoV RaTG13, a bat isolated from a bat's nose.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for determining parental relationship.
In other words, bats cannot host an immediate reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 unless bat CoVs are found to be roughly the same in the future.
Possibly, animal hosts intercepted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has seen many early cases of COVID-19, must have been among wild animals sold and killed in the Hunan seafood market, indicating a possible transmission of the virus from animal to human.
Recent metagenomic sequencing studies suggest that a group of at-risk small mammals known as pangolin (Manis javanica) can also be a haven for ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new genetic variant of the CoV Pangolin virus is about 85-92% similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2.
However, these viruses are associated with about 90% similarity in nucleotide sequence to RaTG13.
These viruses are grouped into two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has the same receptor binding range as SARS-CoV-2 and has the same amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ more, although with a higher degree of sequencing similarity across the genome.
In a previous study on patient pangolins, it has been reported that from lung samples, fragments of viral DNA have been isolated that are already linked to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different methods of sequencing and manual modification to create a part of the genome sequence that made up about 86.3% of the length of the virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 animal interface.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolin because there is a divergence between the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been reached.
While the highest sequence homology has been observed in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs associated with beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genomic sequence homology.
It is estimated that a high degree of similarity between beta-CoV RBDs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution by selective mediation.
A different proposal supports the recombination of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Recombination as a driving force in evolution is common among beta-CoVs.
The judgment on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not over.
Alongside highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are still under study.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229 may be derived from bat CoVs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 viruses are found in rodents.
The bat CoV, known as .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), seen in the North American tricolor bat, is reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, while camelids are also suspected as the middle host of the virus.
To clarify, the information about the animal origin of known HCoVs in Figure 1 and Table 2 is summarized.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was transmitted among different animal species to infect humans through livestock, it triggered a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alpha-CoV alpaca.
Numerous evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus by bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may interact with bats in a common ecological environment.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV causes respiratory disease in animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas have received alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogen viruses in humans, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-CoVs act as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and a mountain camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as seen in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a great example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels in a mountain and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was evident from the very beginning of the detection of the virus, and subsequent findings reinforced the theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, crowded colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all conditions for bats to develop into an ideal virus spreader.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been injected into a camel of a mountain for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these camels, and the camel has evolved from a middle host to a stable, normal host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease, and in these animals, the rate of mutation is relatively low.
The occasional transmission of the virus to humans is a random event, and the human host is a dead end of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolin is different in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if it is involved.
Pangolin beta-CoV is highly contagious in pangolin.
These animals may host stagnant beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar to those in the case of SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans, which should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can host the virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological position with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolin could be one of the booster intermediate hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has just arrived.
Humans are infected with the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.
Domestic and wild animal testing is essential for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has come into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three other factors on the virus's side are also important to facilitate the passage of CoVs through existing barriers.
First of all, there is a relatively high rate of mutation in their RNA replication.
The estimated mutation rate in the CoV virus, with a moderate replacement rate, is equivalent to about 10-4 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new host, which can be considered “moderate” to “high” compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses.
CoVs have an error-correcting exoribonuclease, the removal of which can lead to very high mutations, degradation, or even the inability to continue to survive.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's analog nucleotide inhibition by inhibiting these exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase inhibits the proliferation of CoV.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is about a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of compatibility with humans.
Possibly, the virus has now adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which is well-compatible with a camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic change will quickly make vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs provides surplus flexibility in modifying the genome for genetic mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of cross-conversion between species, which in appropriate circumstances contributes to the emergence of new CoVs.
This is supported by a large amount of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions encoded to the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and repeatedly change moulds at the time of RNA replication through a unique "copy-selection" mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing reservoir, string switching occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Long-length subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat-CoV and batCoV-HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural recombination has been found.
Virus Interaction - Host in relation to transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical sample, showing evidence of a positive choice during an interspecies transmission event.
Based on a comparative analysis between isolated human samples and SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoV adapts quickly to different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of CoV virus interacts with the cellular receptor and triggers the host’s intense antibody response.
In the SARS-CoV virus, it is contained in the amino acids 318 to 510 and on the fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and the common receptors of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, rats, and raccoons, which allows interspecies transmission for the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acids differed from the viral samples taken from humans and in the RBD, with four of them in the binding-receptor motif to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV-Siot has a K479N and S487T mutation in its RBD, which may increase the desire for the interaction of nail proteins with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two successors of amino acids may be vital to viral compatibility with humans.
SARS-CoV-2 has a cellular receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit, suggesting that the tendency to connect the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests there is a 10 to 20-fold tendency for this link between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine if another common receptor is needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC43.
These receptors may also explain the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after transferring between species of animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, single-capped camels, and rodents, may hinder interspecies transmission.
For an interspecies transmission to be successful, HCoV must control the host-dependent factors and eliminate the host-limiting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important field of virus-host interaction must be identified and identified.
Completely neutral genome screening of host dependence and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: from the beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs has opened up many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs act as a reservoir of the genes of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also promote the evolution of HCoVs and act as two important stages in the process.
For example, gaining or losing new protein coding genes has the potential to radically change virus phenotypes.
Among the side proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in human adaptation, because after the SARS-CoV-associated bat virus was isolated, it was found that the virus encodes different ORF8 proteins.
The nucleotide-29 elimination feature of SARS-CoV has been observed in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be a adaptive mutation that helps change hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with the ancestors of alpha and gamma CoVs, in which a large number of smaller recombination domains were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombinant locations were identified in nsp9, the majority of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
The MERS-CoV virus has also been shown to be the cause of the pandemic, experiencing recombination events between different ancestors that occurred in Saudi Arabia’s single-capped camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in their unstructured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of viruses from selective pressure, for example by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype race of HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although ORF4 is intact and can be found in HCoV-229 E-related viruses in bats and camels, alpha-CoV alpaca with an additional single nucleotide leads to a change in the framework.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure on their reservoir hosts.
The absence of mild symptoms or symptoms was diagnosed when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a cross-compatibility between the CoV and the bat.
Bats appear to have adapted well to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a deficiency in activation of a pre-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, normal killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the resetting of NKG2/CD94 killer cell receptors and the low level of tissue adaptation of large Class I complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are caused by high metabolic activity in bats, can both suppress CoV proliferation and affect the recurrence of the oxoribonuclease effect, thus providing selective pressure to produce highly pathogenic strains of the virus when it enters a new host.
CoV races that are most pathogenic may be recombinated, resulting in new protein gains or protein characteristics for host compatibility.
So, it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
These viruses multiply vigorously without encountering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are some of the secrets why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense activity of the immune system and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In asymptomatic carriers, in contrast, the immune response is different from CoV proliferation.
The separation strategy of immune response communication may have beneficial effects in the treatment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medication.
Interferon responses in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, managing type I interferon should be helpful, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of influenza NLRP3 in bats is defective.
With this argument, inhibiting influenza NLRP3 along with MCC950 may be helpful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV events.
While the beta-CoV is 95% nucleotide equivalent to SARS-CoV, there is a beta-CoV that is 96% nucleotide equivalent to SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animal shelter markets have been identified as SARS-CoV-like viruses, the immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs, very similar to SARS-CoV-2, have been found to suggest that pangolins may act as one of the intermediate hosts, or that beta-CoVs of Pangolin can contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans intentionally or accidentally, but there are questions.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our understanding of the importance of the origin and storage of animal HCoVs in human transmission.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing the marine animal market and killing civets effectively ended SARS.
With the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent animal transmission to humans, due to the discovery of several beta-CoV ancestors closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarifying how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pangolin and other mammals to humans still requires further research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in camels of a mountain for a long time.
These camels are considered an important means of transport, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the locals.
These camels are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, just like what was done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent a recurrent outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to produce vaccines that are effective against MERS-CoV for camels, along with other pollution control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause disease outbreaks.
Some types of CoVs shared between humans and animals are circulating in the wild.
Specifically, bat CoVs with the potential for animal-to-human transmission are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for these common CoVs between humans and animals to grow and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are highly transmissible and lethal.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China needs to be put aside to reduce unnecessary connections between humans and animals.
With the rigor test we had for SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we need to have a better plan for preparation and response.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to overflow.
Although bats have many features that help spread the virus, if people are trained to avoid them, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, and will be useful in preventing the spread of the animal to humans.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent viruses shared between humans and animals is to keep humans away from the ecological balance of the natural reservoirs of viruses shared between humans and animals.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First, if a bat had transmitted an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the bat and the pangolin could coexist in a common ecological position.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmission to humans, how did humans come into contact with bats?
Third, if a third mammal has acted as the host of the actual interface, how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolin.
And finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental care and contagion should be taken.
The bat, pangolin, or any other mammal is expected to detect SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses, which are almost identical, in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates to COVID-19 diagnostic criteria on "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" are required
On February 6, 2020, our team released a quick guide to diagnosing and treating the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV), providing our experience and a good reference for fighting the pandemic around the world.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, with our awareness and knowledge gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this article, we provided a view on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), also known as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2, our team created a quick guide and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
This guide has received a lot of attention since its release.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published a total of seven times between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, in which some texts have been changed.
Now Zhou and colleagues have provided a perspective on our guide, which includes offering a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their article added new evidence to our guide and provided valuable references to the pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their outstanding work and express our appreciation.
However, their article should be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm suspected cases, one of the characteristics of epidemiological history must be combined with two of the obvious clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or, if it lacks a history of epidemiological symptoms, must meet three of the obvious clinical symptoms:
Epidemiology history: (1) travel or settlement history in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms (with a positive nucleic acid test); and (4) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory illness from Wuhan city and surrounding areas.
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) image characteristics taken from COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells indicating a normal, decreased lymphocyte count in the early stages of the disease.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with one of the following pathogens or serological evidence: (1) PCR real-time test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis; (2) genome sequence of the entire virus showing high homogeneity with the new coronavirus; or (3) IgV-CoV-positivity in terms of IgM-II and IgG-SAG antibody tests.
We can see that real-time PCR testing in terms of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020), and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid detection, and also based on a sample from the respiratory tract, including a blood sample, which gives more access to different samples and supports the positivity of certain antibodies in approved criteria.
In addition, there is additional evidence that warns us to be cautious with unusual symptoms and patients who do not have symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.’s chart should be updated, because in this flowchart a person who has no clinical symptoms is classified as “low risk.”
The score system should also be confirmed in practice and with further clinical studies.
To sum up, we hope that more direct evidence will be presented and we ask readers to provide their opinions.
To diagnose “suspected” and “confirmed” cases, we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also update the guide on a regular basis to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily tally so far
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on this day.
This is the highest number of daily deaths due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported yesterday that recorded cases of the infection include 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases, which are resting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, told an online news conference that the death toll was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were aged between 50 and 60 and one was between 41 and 50.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
One of the hospital staff told Anadolu News Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Seyfur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission who was being monitored at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh’s Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader announced in an online video announcement that public transport will be closed until next Saturday, more than originally planned.
The public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Essential goods – medical goods, fuel and food – continued to be transported.
The first case of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 was the wife of two passengers who had returned from Italy.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than a million people worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia, the day has become a milestone.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed it was one of the few countries to be free of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases yesterday, 79,332 of which were 24 hours before 10 a.m. in Central Europe (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, leading to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, based on data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday due to the coronavirus.
Countries around the world have taken stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city's closure to 1.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that the salaries of Russian citizens will be paid across the country without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal’s parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for another 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended travel restrictions in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all hours of the day; previously, travel restrictions were only implemented between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand is planning to impose restrictions on traffic between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended home quarantine rules to 1.
Australian stores cut the purchase quota for toilet paper each time they shop
Australia's Woolworths and Coles chain stores, on Saturday and Sunday evenings, reduced the purchase limit of toilet paper in all country-wide stores by two and one packages for each purchase, respectively.
The ALDI store also announced the purchase of a package on Monday.
The restrictions were announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of these chain stores.
According to reports, shoppers are buying and storing because of fear of needing a personal quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
The changes followed the previous four-package limit for each purchase announced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles said in a press release on March 8 that despite the four-pack purchase restriction, "the availability of many stores will be exhausted within an hour" and called the demand "unprecedented," the ALDI store said on its Facebook page on Tuesday, describing it as "unexpected."
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales have experienced a “severe increase” over the past week.
Last week, the Canberra-based Costco store also limited the amount of permitted purchases to two packages.
To mitigate this shortfall, Coles has ordered larger packages to suppliers and has increased delivery times to stores, Woolworths has ordered more inventory. ALDI has made inventory related to one of Wednesday’s special sales plans available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase their inventory, but the local council’s restrictions on the timing of delivery trucks have made it difficult to do so.
He said he expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to respond to demand and special sales to fall.
On Tuesday, the ALDI Store announced that some stores will not be able to hold a special sale on Wednesday due to an earlier inventory offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores fill up their inventory every night.
He added that the bulkyness of toilet paper leads to a small inventory of stores, and when the product is finished, it leaves a lot of space on the shelves and induces a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are a lot of products on the shelf, if there are products like toilet paper and disinfectants in high numbers and there is the possibility to buy them, your fears will likely be minimized.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, announced on Wednesday that their inventory is up.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent toilet paper, stressed that they operate 24/7 to meet the demand.
Domain.com, one of the most active real estate sites, reported that when there were fewer auctions due to the closure of shoppers on the long weekend of Labor Day, some real estate vendors donated free toilet paper to the first bidders in Melbourne.
The Thursday edition of NT News, one of Darwin’s newspapers, had a special eight-leaf letter to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 ABC Australia report, these stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions and announced that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is a high demand for other goods, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, liquid and toilet soap and flour.
Outside Australia, the English online supermarket Ocado also saw Sunday evening restrictions on the purchase of Andres toilet paper by two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 - caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the spread of a disease, not the extent to which it is dangerous, the WHO stressed the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the duration of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said that countries would have their own people diagnosed, tested, treated, quarantined and tracked if they were to be prepared.
We are deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity, and by the alarming level of inappropriate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: “Apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked, from the emergence to the ongoing global outbreak.
Ghebreyesus said: "We've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that, at the same time, is manageable.”
The new status was declared as a pandemic following the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency with international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, “The front-line situation is getting worse.”
As of Thursday, there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths, the Associated Press reported.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was declared a public health emergency with international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, leading to about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at around 4%, while globally it has ranged from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder.
The time period from the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Early treatment is the treatment of symptoms and supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth while coughing, staying away from other people, and personal monitoring and quarantine for people who are suspected of developing the disease.
Officials around the world have reacted to the virus by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, military rule, workplace risk control, and closure of various locations.
The pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disruptions, postponements or cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and a massive resource shortage that is exacerbated by neurological purchases.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have been shut down either nationally or locally, affecting 99.4% of the world’s students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, with cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and other people of race and appearance in East and Southeast Asia, as well as people from areas with widespread spread of the virus.
Due to travel restrictions and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and in early January 2020, the investigation began.
These were largely linked to the wholesale market for havana seafood, and so it is thought that the virus originated from animals.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, the Pangolin coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. It was later found that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that the person had no apparent connection with the next group related to the seafood market.
It was found that out of the initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds had a connection to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that one case had been tracked on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei province who could be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, despite the decline in cases in China, there was a sudden increase in new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China.
The number of cases may be reported to be significantly less than the actual number, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases had been reported among young people, with people aged 19 and less accounting for only 2.4% of all cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, estimated that about 60% of the UK’s population should be infected in order to achieve mass safety effectively.
The number of people tested positive for COVID-19 is based on official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted an official policy not to test people with only mild symptoms.
The study, published on March 16, found that as of January 23, about 86% of cases of COVID-19 had not been detected, and these unreported cases were the source of 79% of cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
Preliminary estimates for COVID-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time between the onset of symptoms and death ranged from 6 to 41 days and the most common time was 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 70% of them had underlying diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of the number of deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, as this figure may not include people who died without testing - for example at home, in nursing centers, etc.
Incomplete data from Italy showed that the number of untested deaths during the pandemic was about 5-4 times higher than the official death toll from COVID.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated “we know [the reported death rate] is less than the actual rate,” the statement corresponds to informal reports that the figures are less pronounced in the United States. Such actions often occur in pandemics, including in the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2020, and the first confirmed death in January 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
By February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica. Various measurement scales are commonly used to measure mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent from the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health status. The mortality rate is achieved by dividing the number of deaths into total cases diagnosed over a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number is different in each region.
In China, the death rate was estimated to have dropped from 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from January 10-1, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after February 1, 2020). Other measurements include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease, the percentage of deaths (IFR) and the percentage of deaths (IFR).
These statistics do not have a time limit, and a specific population follows from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford’s Evidence-Based Medical Center estimates that the overall disease fatality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO insists that the pandemic is manageable.
Regarding the peak and final duration of the outbreak, it is not possible to comment definitively and may vary based on location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: “Common infectious diseases usually stabilize if no action is taken to control them and begin to decrease when the disease is removed from the available hosts.
But for now, it is impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, chief medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries were mobilized to follow the WHO’s recommendations on tackling the outbreak, “the disease could end by June.”
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Tropical Health and Medicine announced on March 17 that SARS-CoV-2 would "probably be in circulation for a year or two."
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at Royal College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is made (possibly taking 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think the likelihood that the coronavirus will disappear completely is low - because it is easily transmissible" and "may become a seasonal disease that recurs every year."
The severity of this reversal will depend on collective immunity and the severity of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific, and people with it may be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that are less common include fatigue, sputum production, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, tremors, vomiting, blood clotting, diarrhea and cyanosis. The World Health Organization says that about one in six people become severely ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, sudden distress, difficulty waking up, bruising of the face and lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory dystrophy, even sepsis, death.
Some people with the disease may have no symptoms, have no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm that they have the disease, so researchers recommend that people who have close contact with the infected person should be closely monitored and tested to prevent their infection.
China’s estimates of the rate of people without symptoms range from very low to 44%.
The typical incubation period (between a person’s incubation and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the percentage of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell was initially 30% but later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is thought to spread mainly through close contact with small particles produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; and close communication means a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that uncoated coughing can spread small particles between 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some research has suggested that the virus can be transmitted by small particles that are produced by speaking and remain in the air for longer periods of time. Although the virus is generally not airborne, tiny respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including speech.
These tiny particles can land in the mouth or nose of nearby people or be transmitted to their lungs through breathing.
Some medical procedures, such as respiratory pituitary and heart respiration (CPR), can result in airborne airborne discharge spraying, resulting in airborne outbreaks.
It is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of the disease being transmitted through feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before symptoms and later stages of the disease can be transmitted, but the highest incidence is in the first three days.
People whose test results were positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms show that it is possible to transmit the disease before significant symptoms appear.
There are few reports of symptoms that have been confirmed by the lab, but the transmission of symptoms has been detected by some countries during communication tracking research.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that while the rapid spread of the disease is not fully known, one infected person can usually infect two or three others. The virus survives on different surfaces, from hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus survives for up to three days on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, these values can vary depending on humidity and temperature. So far, there have been cases of positive test results for COVID-19 in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but UK authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, such as when they come into contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first identified in three people with pneumonia who had come into contact with a group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the coronavirus-related viruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap that removes its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically beta-coronavirus, the subspecies of the Sarbecovirus (Generation B) along with two genes derived from bats.
At the general genome level, the virus corresponds to 96 percent of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that between pangolin viruses and humans, there was only one amino acid in certain parts of their genome sequence.
Comparisons of the full genome to date have concluded that up to 92% of the genetic material is shared between the coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infected by the virus, it can be temporarily detected through symptoms, however, the final confirmation is made through the polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of infected discharges or CT imaging.
Research that compares PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific because many of the features of CT imaging overlap with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or early test to diagnose COVID-19."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The experiment uses the momentary polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) reverse transcription.
This test can be done on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of this test are usually determined within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is done with a nasopharynx swab, however, throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these methods have been accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological experiment developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been approved by some reputable laboratories.
Characteristic characteristics of imaging in radiography and computerized tomography (CT) people with symptoms include asymmetrical grand glass peripheral views and lack of sidewalks.
The Italian Radiology Association is compiling an international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases of the disease.
Unconfirmed PCR imaging, due to overlapping with other infections, such as adenovirus, is not specifically used to detect COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR, and found that although less imaging could be used specifically to diagnose the disease, it was faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based intricate neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus both by radiography and by CT.
Some ways to prevent the disease include proper personal hygiene, washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with hands sitting, and taking a nap while coughing or sneezing, and throwing a napkin straight into the trash.
Those who already have the disease are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. Many governments have banned or recommended non-essential travel to countries or regions where the disease is common.
However, the virus has reached an outbreak stage in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some people do not know where or how they have been infected. To people who provide health care for potential infected people, it is recommended to follow standard precautions, contact-related precautions, and use eye protection. Contact tracking is one of the important practices for health authorities to be able to detect the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile location information by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been created or proposed to be used voluntarily, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions that do not violate privacy, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Then, users will receive a message if they are in close contact with a person with COVID-19.Some misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading; for example, nasal rinsing or mouthwashing are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with homemade soap, which kills the protective bubble.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based disinfectants with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with their sitting hands.
Removing contamination from surfaces is possible in a variety of ways (one minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadin.
Other methods such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID in a building such as an office or day care center, all departments such as offices, health care, shared areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with their elbows or napkins when coughing or sneezing and throw away the towel immediately.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the size and distance of the particles that are scattered when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to the University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s desire to touch their face, which is an important source of infection if they don’t take proper hand hygiene.”
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care about people with COVID-19, however, they also confirm that wearing masks helps people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in the community, especially when they have close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or stopping in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities encourage people to make masks at home using cloth and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going outside without wearing a mask or covering their noses.
On March 16, Vietnam urged all people to wear masks to protect themselves and others when going to public places.
The Australian government has made wearing masks mandatory for those visiting grocery stores.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear masks during the gathering.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for commuters on intercity trains and buses to wear masks since April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask when going out and has advised those who cannot afford a mask to make their own homemade masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes pollution control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
These practices include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools and workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
People can follow these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding being in crowded areas, greeting people without contact, and physical distance from others.
At the moment, many governments have made social distancing mandatory or recommended in areas where the disease is spreading.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health agencies quickly dropped from 250 people (if there is no COVID-19 outbreak in the region) to 50 and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure and immunodeficiency are at greater risk for severe complications and the CDC has advised people to "stay at home as much as possible" from social distancing and social distancing, from social distancing and social distancing, to the other areas where the disease has spread in the community.
The use of the term "social distancing" instead of encouraging people to maintain communication using alternative methods meant that people had to enter complete social isolation. Some authorities issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
These guidelines included recommendations about having sex only with the person you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus or who has no symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected of being infected, personal quarantine at home is recommended.
Health organizations have outlined minor guidelines for proper personal quarantine. Many governments have made or recommended personal quarantine mandatory for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The strictest personal quarantine guidelines have been issued to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the disease has spread widely are advised to observe a 14-day quarantine since the last contact.
Strategies for controlling the spread of a disease include containment, suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected people, as well as introduce other measures to control the disease and vaccination to stop the spread to the rest of the population.
When curbing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are moved to a mitigation strategy: measures are taken to reduce the spread and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
Suppression requires more stringent measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of base infections to less than 1. The part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as straightening the pandemic curve.
This reduces the risk of over-pressure to health services and provides more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, personal quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing, including school closures and cancellation of events in which there is a large gathering of people; social participation in the city's efforts to prevent the spread of these interventions; and environmental measures such as the high severity of the disease.
Other countries also implemented a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea conducted group screenings and local quarantines and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased mask production and imposed penalties for hoarding medical supplies. Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation strategies (slowing the spread of the pandemic rather than stopping it) and suppression (reversing the growth of the pandemic) face major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could halve the peak health demand to 2/3 and the death rate, but they are still killing hundreds of thousands and putting too much pressure on the health system.
Suppression can be a better strategy, but as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it happens sooner), it should be maintained, because if the measures are abandoned, the rate of infection will quickly return to what it was before.
The long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic will create social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for COVID-19, although efforts are underway to develop it, including testing existing drugs.
Using medications without the need for a cold prescription, drinking fluids and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous injections and breathing aids may be needed.
The use of steroids can make the condition worse.
Several of the compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to be used if they are useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also announced "a few traditional and home remedies" that can help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described increasing capacity and adapting the health system to the needs of COVID-19 patients as one of the fundamental measures to combat the spread of the disease.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization’s Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources to various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-essential surgeries if possible, isolating and isolating patients with COVID-19, and increasing the capacity of intensive care by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are different opinions about where the first case (so-called zero patient) originated.
The first case of the new coronavirus may return on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these people were associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the origin of the virus was one of these animals, in other words, the virus was of animal origin. A group of people with pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was informed by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which was treated on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "sars-like coronavirus".
Police advised eight of them, including Li Wenliang, to refrain from spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was punished by his superiors for giving the warning.
Later, the Wuhan City Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31, notifying the World Health Organization.
Many cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause were reported to Wuhan health authorities, prompting them to launch an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled, approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transmitted to other provinces in China with the help of Chinese New Year travel and given that Wuhan is one of the transportation hubs and major rail exchange hubs.
On January 20, 2020, China reported about 140 new cases, including one in Beijing and one in Shenzhen in a single day.
Further official data shows that 6,174 people had symptoms as of January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 died and 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and began border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantine (known as a stay-at-home order, shelter or home quarantine), and military rule. As of April 2, about 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, were under some kind of home quarantine, in the Philippines, more than 50 million, in South Korea about 59 million, and in India, 1.3 billion people were under quarantine.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world underwent some kind of quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The tracking of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 goes back to December 1, in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report says the first case was on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of people with pneumonia with an unknown cause, according to which the hospital reported the matter to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing on samples of patients on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
On December 31, a public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the matter on the same day.
With the information being circulated, the police warned Wuhan doctors about the "rumor spread" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a basic campaign called “People’s War” to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
In what is referred to as the "biggest quarantine in human history," a health belt was identified on January 23 that stopped entry and exit from Wuhan, a total of 15 cities from Hubei province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
Officials also announced that a temporary hospital called Huoshenshan Hospital will be built, which will be completed within 10 days.
After that, another hospital, called Leichenshan Hospital, was built to handle more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan, including convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government began other measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including health announcements for travelers and increased spring festive holidays.
Schools and colleges across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau began to take action, especially in schools and universities.
Measures related to remote work began in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were put in place for entry and exit from Hubei.
Public transport was revamped and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement controls were imposed in many cities, with an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) facing some form of restrictions on going out. In March, after the outbreak entered the global stage, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "entering" from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, only one case in mainland China was transferred within five days, which happened by a passenger returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the transmission of the disease inside the country has been radically curtailed and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
On the same day, i.e. two months after the quarantine, travel restrictions in Hubei were eased, except in the city of Wuhan. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that entry into the country for visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from March 28, and did not provide any details on when the policy would expire.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and offered money stimulus packages to companies. The state council announced that April 4, which coincides with the pilgrimage day of the tomb, will be a public mourning and will begin with three minutes of country-wide silence at 10:00 p.m., however, the central government requested families to observe physical distancing and avoidance.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 was transmitted through China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health department announced a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly related to a gathering in Daegu that belonged to a new religious movement called the Church of Christ.
It was thought that the Shincheonji disciples who had come from Wuhan to Daegu were the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, from 9336 followers of the church, symptoms had been reported in 1,261 people, or about 13% of them. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
After three soldiers tested positive, all South Korean military bases were quarantined.
The airline's program was also affected and as a result changed. South Korea introduced a program for population screening and isolation, which was known as the world's largest and most organized program for population screening and isolation of all infected people, as well as tracking and quarantine of those who had been in contact with them.
The screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms for newcomers to the international via a mobile app, testing centers that can be accessed by car and results the next day, and testing capacity increases to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean program, despite not having all cities quarantined, is considered one of the most successful programs to control outbreaks. South Korean society was initially bipolar over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach Moon for what they called bad governance, and others praised his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all passengers arriving from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for help in testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, a city where two people died later on the same day, according to a statement from the Minister of Health and Medical Education.
The initial measures announced by the government included cancellation of concerts and other cultural, sports, Friday prayers and closures of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict travel between cities, but heavy traffic between cities continued on the eve of Iranian New Year celebrations.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.In February, Iran became the epicenter of the outbreak of the virus after China.
Among claims to have concealed the true extent of the outbreak in Iran, as of February 28, tracking cases in more than ten countries showed their origins in Iran, suggesting that the actual rate of the outbreak was probably more than 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
With 23 of the 290 parliamentarians tested positive on March 3, the Iranian parliament was shut down.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders who had been detained for peaceful opposition, as well as all eligible prisoners.
The watchdog said the risk of the virus spreading in closed locations such as detention centers that lack adequate medical care was higher.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians or officials have died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a World Health Organization official, cases in Iran are five times more likely to be reported.
It is also thought that U.S. sanctions on Iran may have negatively impacted Iran’s financial ability to deal with the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for the countries that have the most impact from the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome, the outbreak was confirmed in Italy.
The number of cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to or from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group of unrecognized COVID-19 cases were later identified, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new legal order to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine for more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “In areas where the disease is common, entry and exit will not be possible.
On March 4, when the death toll reached 100, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country.
All major sporting events, including Series A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian School of Anesthesia, Anesthesia, Rehabilitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding triage protocols that may be used.
On March 19, after reporting 3,405 deaths due to the pandemic, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft containing medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of them in Lombardy.
A report from CNN found that the combination of two factors, the large population of older people and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date, could contribute to a higher mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus was one of the simplest among the countries affected by the disease, and as of March 18, 2020, the UK government did not impose any social distancing or mass quarantine measures for its citizens.
As a result, the country’s government faced criticism about the lack of proper speed and intensity in response to the concerns the community was facing. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts be cancelled and advised people to work from home if possible and refrain from attending places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational centers, such as pubs and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers' wages up to <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 a month to prevent unemployment during this crisis. On 23 March, the prime minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which would consider banning gatherings of more than two people and restrictions on travel.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to shut down, with the exception of businesses considered “essential,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, tool shops, gas stations, and repair shops.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Pacific region of Washington state was confirmed to be a man who had returned from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House coronavirus task force was formed on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on travelers arriving from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the main public health institution of the U.S. government - announced that it had built its own testing kit.
Despite this, the U.S. had a slow start in testing people, which left the actual rate of outbreaks unclear at the time.
The failure of non-government testing kits (produced by universities, companies, and hospitals) by the federal government until the end of February and restrictive criteria to qualify for testing by early March (then requiring a doctor's prescription) disrupted the testing process in February.
The Washington Post reported that as of February 27, less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that as of March 13, less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many people who had symptoms and also had a doctor’s prescription have waited for hours or days to get tested.”After the first death in the United States was reported in Washington on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a move that soon occurred in other states as well.
On March 3, schools in the Seattle area canceled their classes, and by mid-March, schools across the country were closed. On March 6, 2020, a group of epidemiologists at the Royal College of London made predictions about the impact of the new coronavirus on the United States.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Supplementary Credit Preparedness and Counter-Coronavirus Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding to federal agencies to combat the outbreak.
The companies put restrictions on staff travel, canceled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Seasons and sporting events were canceled. On March 11, Trump imposed travel restrictions on most European countries, except the UK, for 30 days, starting on March 13.
The next day, he extended the restrictions to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On March 13, he declared a national emergency that made federal funds available to deal with the crisis.
Since March 15, many businesses across the U.S. have been shut down or reduced their working hours in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the pandemic had been confirmed in all 50 states of the country and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that New York City had 10,700 coronavirus cases, more than all cases in South Korea alone.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing seemed to be beneficial as the pace of infection slowed, with estimates doubling from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City and 672 deaths from the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the United States had more coronavirus cases than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, there were 400,335 confirmed cases in the United States and 12,841 deaths.
According to media reports on March 30, President Trump decided to extend the social distancing guidelines until April 30.
On the same day, USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, anchored in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded a record 884 coronavirus deaths in a 24-hour period.
On April 3, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 in the state of New York. The White House was criticized for undermining the threat and controlling information by ordering health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and announcements related to the virus with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.
Trump’s overall approval of crisis management has had supporters and dissidents.
Some U.S. officials and analysts have criticized the U.S. reliance on importing sensitive goods from China, including essential medical equipment.
In order to map and predict disease outbreak patterns, an analysis of air travel patterns was used and was published in the journal Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
According to 2018 data from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for travelers traveling from Wuhan.
Among the 20 most popular destination cities, Bali was ranked as the least-prepared city and Australia's cities were ranked as the most-prepared cities. Australia announced an emergency containment plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
The plan said there was still a lot of information to be discovered about COVID-19, and Australia would focus on border controls and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a state of emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries decided to evacuate their citizens and diplomats from the region, mainly through the country of origin’s proprietary flights and approvals from Chinese authorities.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has said it has no plans to evacuate its citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or their family members, as well as four Polish nationals, a Chinese national and an Indian national.
Citizens of Poland, China, and India took off from the plane in Poland, where the Brazilian plane stopped before proceeding to Brazil.
Brazilian citizens who had gone to Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near Brazilia.
On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 on the first plane and 39 on the second plane chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan and transported to CFB Trenton to be quarantined for two weeks.
On February 11, another plane transported 185 Canadians from Wuhan to CFB Trenton.
Australian authorities evacuated 277 of their citizens on February 3 and 4 and moved them to the Christmas Island detention center where they had been quarantined for 14 days.
The evacuation flight from New Zealand landed in Auckland on February 5; passengers (including those from Australia and Oceania) were quarantined at a naval base in Whangaparoa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the U.S. announced it would evacuate the American cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On February 21, the airline, carrying 129 Canadian passengers who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess ship, landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African airliner chartered by the South African government returned 112 South African citizens to the country.
To reduce the risk, medical screening was done before the move, and four South African nationals who had symptoms of coronavirus were not allowed to board the plane.
Only those South Africans whose test results were negative were returned to the country.
The test results showed that all South African nationals, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission were cleared, however as a precautionary measure, they were all quarantined and monitored for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began withdrawing troops from Iraq in part because of the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities joined together to send help to China’s virus-hit sectors, and formed a joint group in the Greater Chicago area, which reportedly sent 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei Province on January 30. By January 30, the Humanitarian Aid Organization (HRO) had sent emergency relief to the hospital by the United Airlines, coordinated FedEx, with 200,000 masks and other personal protective equipment.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates donated $100 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to fund research into vaccine development and therapeutic efforts and protection of "risk groups in Africa and South Asia."
On February 6, Interaksyon reported that after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan, the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send aid worth $2.26 million to China.
Japan donated one million masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced that it would donate 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany sent various medical equipment, including 10,000 specialty items of hazardous substances, and the United States started to donate 17.8 tons of medical equipment to China, and it appeared that it would help the countries affected by the virus.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical equipment and experts to Italy to help the country deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Jack Ma, a well-known businessman, sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective clothing to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to be distributed by the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 ventilators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed their concern about the masks and test kits made by China.
For example, Spain sent back 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits, with an accuracy rate of only 30%, and the Netherlands returned 600,000 Chinese masks that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable masks believed to have come from China but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization lauded the Chinese authorities’ efforts to manage and contain the pandemic.
The World Health Organization pointed to the conflict between the SARS outbreak in 2004–2002 and the current crisis, at which time Chinese officials were accused of covertly obstructing the success of efforts to prevent and contain the disease, but in the current crisis, the central government was “providing new news on a regular basis so that there was no panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday.”
On 23 January, Gauden Galea, WHO representative, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban the transport in Wuhan announced: While the decision was "certainly not from the World Health Organization's recommendations of the Sixth World Health Organization's Declaration of State of Emergency", "it was a very important sign of commitment to contain this pandemic in the first 30 years of the human-recognized period of the pandemic, the outbreak is the most concentrated" and it is called "an an unprecedented decision in the history of public health."
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the PHEIC was announced because of the “risk of global disease outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack a powerful health system.”
In response to the travel restrictions, Tedros said “there is no reason for actions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On February 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) cited the need to support low-income countries that “lack of systems to diagnose people with the virus, even if symptoms appear,” asking the global community for $675 million to spend on strategic preparedness in these countries.
In addition, Tedros said in a statement that "we are only as strong as our weakest member" and urged the international community to "invest today or spend more later."
On the same day, Tedros announced that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to "allocate the power of the entire UN system to combat the disease."
As a result, a crisis management team was activated at the United Nations that coordinated all of the UN countermeasures, the World Health Organization said it would allow them to “focus on tackling health issues while other organizations, using their expertise to deal with the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint operation team led by the World Health Organization in cooperation with China was activated to assist with the deployment of World Health Organization experts and international experts in China, in the internal management and evaluation of the "intensity and contagiousness of the disease", the village should also be prepared by hosting workshops and holding meetings with key institutions at the national level. The other task of the team was to conduct field visits to assess the "effectivity" in China.
In response to the growing outbreak of the disease in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint operation team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials announced that the global coronavirus threat assessment had increased from "high" to "very high," the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization’s Emergency Situations Program, warned: “This is a real test for all governments on the planet: Wake up.
“This virus may be on the way and you have to be prepared,” he said, stressing that the right countermeasures can prevent the “worst case” in the world from happening.
Ryan also said that current data has not yet persuaded public health officials to declare a global pandemic, stressing that declaring the situation means "we have fundamentally accepted that every human on the planet is at risk of contracting the virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is "deeply concerned, both at the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity, and at the alarming level of inappropriate action".The World Health Organization (WHO) has received a lot of criticism for poor management of the pandemic, including late declaration of a public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.
These negative reactions included the signing of a memorandum to the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, which was signed by 733,000 people by April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This group of experts said that everyone deserves intervention to save their lives and it is the government’s responsibility.
The group of experts stressed that any lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as justification for discrimination against a particular group of people.
Experts emphasized that every person, including persons with disabilities, minority groups, older people, forced internal migrants, homeless people, those living in very bad conditions, people in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government support, has a right to health.
International government agencies are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on counter-terrorism policies in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations on the issue.
The Digital Center offers policies to strengthen the global health system and economy to counter the negative impacts of lockdowns and travel restrictions, and includes a part to track the policies of countries that aim to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States for its handling of the pandemic, which began in Hubei Province, the Office of British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
A number of provincial-level executives of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for mismanagement of quarantine in the central part of China, a sign of dissatisfaction with how the political institution has dealt with the outbreak in these areas.
Some analysts believe the move is aimed at keeping Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party’s secretary-general, out of public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have rejected their previous confirmation that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, raising a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The Trump administration called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," declaring that "China's censorship has exacerbated the virus and turned it into a global pandemic," the remarks were, in turn, criticized by some critics, as racism and "actions to divert public opinion from its government's failure to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast had access to some U.S. government information describing a media trick that clearly originated from the National Security Council, which the strategy calls "everything related to China."
We were told to make an effort to use all possible means, including press conferences and television appearances, to convey this message," said Bloomberg and other media outlets, including Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, which claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries where the virus has spread were part of a push to make a global impact.
Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, warned that “there is a geopolitical component that involves trying to influence through news turnover and generosity policy.”
Borrell also said that “China wants to relentlessly convey the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also reportedly sent aid to Venezuela and Iran, urging the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions prevented the arrival of 100,000 Jack Ma donor masks to Cuba.
U.S. officials have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries.
There were also reports of disagreements over the mask between countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators that were on their way to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s lack of solidarity with Italy, which had suffered many negative effects from the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “Only China responded.
This is certainly not a good sign for Europe’s solidarity.”
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, ordered the Russian military to send military medicine, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa reported an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or underutilized" for Italy.
The source accused Russia of initiating a “geopolitical and diplomatic” appearance.
Attilio Fontana, President of Lombardy and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media reports and expressed their appreciation for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin “believes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and equipment are strengthened and moved, they will be able to retaliate if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercises will be held on a more limited scale in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest since the end of the Cold War.
Kate Hudson, secretary-general of the nuclear disarmament campaign, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise, saying, “In the current public health crisis, this exercise is not only endangering the lives of U.S. soldiers and many participating European countries, but also threatening the lives of residents of the countries in which the exercises are being conducted.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was seeking help because of the lack of access to global markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran, trying to fight the outbreak. The outbreak has prompted requests to the United States to adopt more public health-care policies in other rich countries.
Political analysts have predicted that the disease could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
After Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea to Japan would be quarantined for two weeks at places designated by the government, South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts."
South Korean society was initially bipolar over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions for Moon's impeachment for what they called bad governance, and others praised his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the disease could allow governments to cling to power more.
Hungary’s parliament allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to personally enact legislation indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those who appear to have spread misinformation about the virus and how the government manages the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been the main cause of several resource shortages due to the increased use of equipment to deal with the outbreak, neurological purchases and disruption of logistics operations and factories.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several locations have also seen neurological shopping, which has led to the emptying of shelves of essentials such as food, toilet paper, and mineral water, instilling a sense of scarcity of resources.
In particular, the tech industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has resulted in a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price, delaying the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the World Health Organization has warned that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened a new opportunity for buyers of daigou to sell Australian products to China.
This activity caused a shortage of milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and its subsequent high demand for food, both regions have been left with severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy have been successful in combating hoarding and illegal buying and selling of essential goods, preventing a severe food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a severe shortage with significant agricultural output, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, it was only occasionally seen that food shelves were empty, and Chinese government officials marketed pork stockpiles to ensure proper nutrition.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: The Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020, according to media reports on March 16, due to measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of the virus and drastically reduce retail sales by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is one of the world’s major economies and manufacturing hubs, the outbreak of the virus poses a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the possible consequences of the current situation is revealed.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative economic impacts of the pandemic on global growth could be greater than the 2004-2002 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by a Washington University expert in St. Louis shows a negative impact of over $300 billion on the global supply chain, which could last up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is "scattering" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to China's declining demand.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to rising concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock exchange indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, experienced their worst crash since 2008, with the Dow index crashing at 1,191 units, the highest in a single day since the 2008-2007 financial crisis.
All three indexes ended the week with a decline of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH approved China’s top credit rating but maintained its negative outlook.
Stock markets once again fell due to fears of the coronavirus, with the largest fall on March 16.
Many people are aware of the economic downturn.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economic expert, praised the emergency and timely measures taken by central banks and governments.
Central banks are responding more quickly to the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel bans, public places closed, including travel attractions, and government advice to avoid any travel around the world, tourism is one of the areas that has suffered the most.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, have cancelled their flights due to reduced demand, and the regional airline Flybe has been shut down in the UK.
The negative impact of the virus on the cruise ship industry was unprecedented.
Several train stations and ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with Chunyun, which is one of the main travel seasons associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A number of events, including New Year’s festivals with large crowds, were canceled by national or regional governments, and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai closed their shops and tourist attractions independently.
Many Lunar New Year’s events and attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, and traditional temple exhibitions, were closed to prevent crowds from gathering.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, ordering most workplaces not to reopen that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of the country’s exports.
Hong Kong raised infection levels to the highest level, declaring a state of emergency, shutting schools until March, and cancelling New Year's celebrations.
Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East saw a 60-50% drop in referrals.
The outbreak also led to a 43-33% reduction in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
The operators of major shopping malls around the world have taken other measures, including increasing hygiene, installing temperature scanners to check buyers’ body temperature, and cancelling events. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could cause between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America to be in extreme poverty, which would not have been possible without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
A large part of the population of about 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the interior provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could damage 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could rise by up to 32%. The closures in India have caused unemployment to tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid on a daily basis).
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to short-term work plans with government subsidies known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme has also been implemented by France and the United Kingdom.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been deeply affected by the pandemic, with both the operations and the manpower of relevant organizations, both at work and independently, being affected around the world.
Activist organizations in the field of culture and art have strived to continue their mission (often funded by the government) in ensuring that society has access to cultural heritage, protect the safety of its employees, and, if possible, protect artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
Instead, many efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. One of the other consequences of the disease, which has recently been rapidly accelerating, is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced problems. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week ceremonies in Rome, which are held during the last week of the Christian season of fasting and repentance, have been cancelled.
Many bishops have advised older Christians to stay home instead of attending Sunday rituals; some churches have made church services available via radio, live broadcasting online or television, and others have made it possible for them to attend the ritual by car.
Roman Catholic bishops have closed their churches and places of worship, and St. Peter’s Square has been evacuated from Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions have also canceled their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and circuses.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and the shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from entering holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most disruption in the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 European League, the 2019-20 Premier League, Euro 2020, the 2019 NBA 20-2019 season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have either been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a date beyond 2020, maximum for summer 2021".
This has caused many gamblers to turn to online sites, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been hit, and many music groups have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have also suspended all theaters.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing works of art over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, including live streaming concerts or creating web-based “festivals” for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.
In the online space, many internet memes have been circulating with the coronavirus theme, so many of them are amidst the existing uncertainty, to the humor and the divergent issues.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese people and East Asians, as well as those at the epicenter of the disease in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostile behavior.
Reports from February (when most of the cases were still confined to China) show racist feelings in groups around the world about whether the Chinese people deserve the virus or are experiencing justifiable punishment.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
Support for the Chinese people, both online and offline, has been provided to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the spread of the disease to other countries, Italians, the first European country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, were also exposed to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed scrolls to ban Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the outbreak.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese nationals, as well as other Asians in the UK and the US, reported increasing rates of racist insults and attacks against themselves.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus," a term that critics call racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian nationals and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan and on their way to Novi Sanzhari.
According to reports, students from Northeast India, who share a border with China and were studying in major Indian cities, experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, head of the state party Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, announced that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "for this reason, God has avenged them."
In China, the pandemic sparked xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, and foreigners were called “foreign junk” and targeted “outsourcing.”
Many newspapers with paid subscriptions removed the subscription fee for all or part of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific articles related to the outbreak available for free.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on servers in pre-release versions, such as bioRxiv.

Tests for respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include ways to detect the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR that the RNA detects the coronavirus.
This test is proprietary and only detects the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
An antibody test shows how many people had the disease by counting people who had very mild symptoms and did not report them, or who had no symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be identified.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the extent of the outbreak in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are significant differences in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
The test, which uses the momentary reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), can be performed on respiratory samples taken in a variety of ways, including nasopharynx swabs or mucus samples.
The results of this test are usually determined between a few hours and two days.
The RT-PCR test, which is done with a throat swab, only provides reliable results in the first week of the disease.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while replicating in the lungs.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken from deep respiratory tract by suction catheter, or it is possible to use coughing material.
One of the first PCR testing samples was invented in January 2020 in Charité, Berlin, using a momentary reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for the 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical diagnostic kit.
The kit follows the "E" gene, which is common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, which is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group International was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization of the 2019 PCR-CoV-based PCR-based diagnostic kit from the ReRT-CoV-2 laboratory. In the United States, the ReRT-DC is now being distributed by the Chinese National Medical Products Centers for Disease Prevention and Disease Control.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kit resulted in unspecified results due to faulty reagents and testing restrictions at the CDC in Atlanta, which resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February.
As of February 28, 2020, testing using two components was not reliable, after which state and local labs were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began conducting the test in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests are available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
There is no limit to the number of tests announced; sample capture and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of COVID-19 test kits was carried out by the country's Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service Center. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in a high volume within 3.5 hours. This allowed a device to perform a 24,128-hour test, during approximately 4,128 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Holographic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA approval for a test that takes 45 minutes from the FDA.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal reinforcement of nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the procedure can deliver a positive result within just five minutes and a negative result within 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices available in the United States, and Abbott expects to be able to deliver 50,000 tests a day with an increase in production. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to deliver up to 15 minutes of rapid influenza test results, just like an influenza test.
A review of the research conducted in March 2020 could conclude that "radio images of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computer tomography] findings can be identified even before symptoms appear."
Typical features in CT include the opacity of multi-lobulized double-sided matte glass with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subcutaneous dominance, defective coverage and stiffness occur.
The research, which compares PCR with CT in Wuhan, which is the origin of the current pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific because many of the features of CT imaging overlap with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or early test to diagnose COVID-19."
Part of the immune system’s response to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to diagnose infection in people after 7 days or more of symptoms, to detect immunity, and to monitor the population. The test can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or through a patient's lab (PoCT).
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on how much each system produces.
For CLT, a sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although several successive samples can be used to track the immune system's response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the pre-test extraction phase is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 entities that had notified the organization as requested and were now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics Medical Laboratory obtained European approval for their test kits. These kits could identify IgG and IgA antibodies that were secreted against the virus and contained in blood samples.
The testing capacity of several hundred samples is within a few hours, and so it is much faster to detect virus RNA than conventional PCR testing.
These antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the disease. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody testing kits it purchased were adequately used.
Hong Kong has implemented a plan that allows suspected patients to stay at home, "emergency department will give the patient a sampling tube," the patient will put his saliva in it and give it back to the clinician, and later he will get the results of the tests with the help of an autopsy. The British NHS has also announced that it is implementing a plan to test suspected cases in the hospital and that the risk of others being infected is reduced.
Automotive testing centers have enabled South Korea to operate one of the fastest and most widespread testing practices compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians announced on March 2 that it has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day on mobile, and 10,700 people have been tested in the past week.
If the test is ordered by a doctor, the costs will be paid by health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, it has been possible to test cars in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown as only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that by the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested by the end of the 12/2020 week, and the result of the trial was 33,491 samples were tested by the instantaneous trial of the SARS-CoV-2-Meter, or 6.9%). In Israel, the researchers of the Hospital Technion and Rambam combined a method to test 64 samples simultaneously, they developed and tested
The lab took five days to build and was monitored by BGI founder Wang Jian, modeling showed that if the testing capacity was not operationalized, the number of cases in Wuhan would have been 47% higher and the quarantine costs would have doubled.
Similar samples, called Huo-Yan Laboratories, were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 tests per day. The open-source and composite designs released by Origami tests can test 1,122 samples of patients using only 93 COVID-19 test kits. These balanced designs are applicable in small laboratories without the need for a liquid robotic examiner.
By March, deficiencies and lack of adequate reagents had become an obstacle to mass testing in Europe, the UK and the United States.
This has led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols, which include heating the samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes, to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE is now testing a large number of its population for the coronavirus, which is now more successful per capita than any other country in the country, and a large part of the country to achieve testing in this regard.
This has been made possible due to the ability to test with the vehicle and purchase a large-scale countrywide population laboratory of the group of 42 and BGI (based on the emergency diagnostic labs "Huo-Yan" in China).
The laboratory, built in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory with this scale to operate outside of China.
Various test recipes that target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were prepared in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization used the German directive to supply and send kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce domestic kits.
The German test kits directive was released on January 17, 2020. Since the protocol prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, it delayed the start of testing in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, failed to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommended cases by health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mainly in private sector laboratories, has been built over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for strengthening testing programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. A high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has delayed hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States and reduced inventory of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by the CDC had "defects". The government then removed bureaucratic barriers from conducting private tests. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not correct.
The company explained that inaccurate results may be the result of difficulty collecting samples or incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish minister said he would not use the kits that provide the wrong results and would replace them with different test kits developed by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits the Czech Republic bought from China yielded the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China, which yielded the wrong results.
Prime Minister Matuvi<0xC4><0x87> suggested that the kits be thrown into the Danube. Atesh Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and they were "not used".The UK government purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but said in early April 2020 that the kits were unusable.
Testing and quarantining followed by people whose test results were positive and tracking those who were associated with people with SARS-CoV-2 positive results have yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing in a 10-day interval on a total population of about 3,400 people.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all positive cases were quarantined.
By limiting travel to public centers, new infections were completely eliminated.
With the serious tracking of people who have been in contact, the restrictions, testing and quarantine of inbound travelers, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much slower than in other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been canceled and Singapore on March 28 recommended residents to stay home, but schools reopened on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by seriously tracking people who have been in contact, restricting, testing and quarantined incoming travelers, but with fewer closures.
A statistical study found that countries that conducted more tests than those who died had a much lower mortality rate, probably because these countries were better able to identify those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited national laboratories with limited experience in the field of COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to be verified.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% positive for all experiments" is influenced by the testing policy of each country.
If all the other conditions were the same, the "positive percentage" would be higher in a country that tests only people admitted to hospitals than in a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person’s hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly during the day in a "sentimental location" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the stool-mouth.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes), they may develop respiratory diseases such as flu or a cold.
Five important positions during the day that are important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby or replacing his diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Hands can be cleaned with ash if soap and water are not available. The World Health Organization recommends:
Before, during and after meals.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, waste animals or feeding animals.
Hand hygiene from a medical perspective refers to health measures related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of medical hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause risk or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in medical-related occupations, but it is also important for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea agents; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduced infant mortality rates at home during childbirth.
A 2013 study found that improvements in hand-washing practices may lead to slight improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate from respiratory disease and diarrhea in children can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about one-third, which is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as an automatic behavior that has become a habit in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only, most effective, and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, which is one of the most important acute respiratory infections, is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five, which causes about 1.8 million deaths each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million deaths of children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet into a solid habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cut diarrhea deaths by almost half, and reduce a quarter of all deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against jaundice infections that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful but small effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin and result in damage to the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin irritation, also known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Excessive and frequent hand washing is also referred to as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of fecal-oral disease are: after going to the bathroom (urine, stool), after cleaning the baby (substituting the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish, or raw chicken.
Other things that should be avoided in order to prevent the spread of the disease include before and after treatment of cuts or wounds, after sneezing, coughing or rinsing; after touching animal waste or touching animals; and after contact with waste.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is very low.
In 2015, a study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households had a habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing with soap for children, i.e., 97 percent of the time. The United States is in the middle with 77 percent, and China is now at the lowest level with 23 percent.
The basic health care program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of the broader measures to promote health and education in children.
De-parasitization twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is the central focus of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water is effective in removing microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solvent barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a sufficient amount of water flow helps in cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous use.
A small number of studies that have investigated the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that it is unlikely that bacteria would be transmitted this way because the bacteria are washed off with the soil.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that "liquid soap that is accessible without direct hand contact is better".
Antibacterial soaps are highly advertised for people who care about hygiene.
To date, there is no evidence that antiseptics or odors are effective in destroying antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which a wide variety of organisms are resistant to.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains were not supposed to be killed with antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as advertised on the market.
Advanced formulations, in addition to surfactant and skin protective material, may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial activated benzoic acid and other antibacterial skin softeners (aloe vera, vitamin, menthol, antibacterial antibacterial inhibitors). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health's Sabone size showed that
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot water combined with soap is more effective in removing natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria than cold water combined with soap.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer is a non-water sanitary substance.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers) gained popularity.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol along with a thickening substance such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) and in gel form, or they use a thinner such as glycerin to ease and reduce the drying effect of alcohol and are made in liquid or foam form.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol are effective killers of microbes.
Alcohol-containing disinfectants kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV virus, rhinovirus, vaginal varicose veins, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol, 30 seconds after use, cause the loss of 99.97% (3.5 logs equivalent to 35 dB) of hand bacteria, and 1 minute after use, cause the loss of 99.99% to 99.99% of viruses. Some are less effective than 4-5 logs.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) types of viruses, which are the most common cause of contagious gastrointestinal disease. A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or an alcohol-containing gel should be used to completely soak or cover both hands.
The back and sides of both hands and between and at the ends of all fingers should be rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
Fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by applying both hands to the floor. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing more than using hand disinfectants, especially when the hands are completely dirty.
The increasing use of these materials is due to their ease of use and their ability to quickly destroy microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause dry skin unless softeners or skin moisturizers are added to their formulation.
The addition of glycerin or other softeners to their preparation formula can reduce or eliminate the dehydration effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand disinfectants containing alcohol and softeners caused much less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hive syndrome, or alcohol sensitivity or additives found in hand sanitizers containing alcohol are rare.
They were less likely to develop contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based materials do not clean hands from organic materials, but disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many diseases, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effect of alcohol-free hand disinfectants is heavily dependent on the ingredients and their formulation and has historically been less effective than alcohol-containing disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have a more cumulative and consistent antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which is likely to decrease its effectiveness after repeated use due to negative skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t make soap and instead use ashes or dirt.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but it may have less impact than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the prevalence of the disease, rather than reducing the spread of the disease, on the contrary.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as a substitute for soap.
The right hand washing procedure recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because stagnant waters may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to make any changes.
Soap and rub your hands in sufficient amounts, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap kills germs on the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using only water.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Grinding hands creates friction and helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing hands for longer kills more germs.
Wash your hands with warm water.
Washing in stagnant water can contaminate the hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands can easily get contaminated. Most of the parts of the hand that remain seated are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Synthetic nails and cut-out nails may be the hiding place of microorganisms.
Moisturizing cream is often recommended to prevent dry hands. Dry skin leads to skin damage and can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are various low-cost options to facilitate handwashing in developing countries when there is no piped water or soap available. For example, pouring water from a gallon or a holed container or using ashes if necessary. In situations where water resources are limited (such as low-cost schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are "small-priced" solutions such as drinking water.
Tap tape is a simple technology that is made from a container hanging from a rope and a lever that can be controlled by the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much healthier than electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a paper towel industry-backed study, the European Textile Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern jet dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and the bacteria in the palms of the hands by 254%.
Drying hands with a jet air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingertips by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% at the tip of the fingers and 77% at the palms of the hands.
The air jet dryer, which reportedly blows out air at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h or 400 m/s), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and devices, potentially contaminating other people using the toilet as well as the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot air dryer, it can disperse microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause a significant release of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt examined various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water when traveling, hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes can be used as an alternative method.
An alcohol-based hand disinfectant should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis diagnosed the effectiveness of hand washing (in 1846) in preventing illness in a hospital setting, hand washing became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that can remind hospital staff if they have forgotten to wash their hands.
One study found that the rate of infection was reduced by using them.
The time required to wash your hands is at least 15 seconds, using an adequate amount of soap and water or gel and rubbing all parts of your hands.
The hands should be rubbed together and the fingers clasped together.
If there is pus under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on your hands, it is important that your hands are well watered and dry with a clean towel.
After hand drying, a paper towel should be used to close the tap (and, if necessary, to open the outlet).
This prevents re-infection of the hands by contact with those surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in medical centers is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is unacceptable in most hospital environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, resulting in the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce up to 66% of the blood flow contamination in which the catheter plays a role. The World Health Organization has published a paper indicating a standard way to wash hands and rub each other’s hands in health care sectors.
A draft hand sanitary guide prepared by the organization is also available to the public on its website.
A related survey was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices can measure and verify the amount of hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines “five times” to wash your hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to the completion of the licensing work, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of disinfectant chemicals to soaps (“pharmaceutical” or “antimicrobial” soaps) strengthens the toxicity of the hand washing agent.
Such measures may be taken before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have the following: water tap that can be opened and closed without direct contact with the hands. Some chlorhexidine or iodine-based cleaning is used to wash other devices, sterilized towels to dry the hands after washing and brushing them.
All the jewels should be removed.
In this method, it is necessary to wash hands and ankles to the elbow for 2-6 minutes.
Long washing (10 minutes) is not required.
When watering, prevent water from returning to the ankles.
After the hand wash is finished, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgical dress is covered.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after taking care of the sick person.
To control staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleaning comes from the first 20% of washing, and when the hand-cleaning frequency reaches more than 35%, there are very few additional benefits.
Hand washing with regular antibacterial soap is three times more likely to transmit bacterial infections to food than with antibacterial soap. Comparison of hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that hand washing with alcohol contributes to 26% of bacterial contamination compared with antibacterial soap.
But the use of soap and water is more effective than hand washing with alcohol-based substances in reducing the H1N1 influenza virus type A and Clostridium Difficile than hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health centers may include training employees to wash their hands, increasing access to alcohol-based detergents, and a written and verbal reminder to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an affordable and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing in homes, schools, and workplaces challenges the need for world-class handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, tap water is scarce to wash hands near private or public toilets, although there are cheaper options for making hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates, mostly due to lack of soap or water, can be the result of our bad habits.
Promoting hand washing with soap can influence selective policies, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral change in society.
Monitoring and evaluation is necessary to ensure that this work is effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social advertising campaigns are less efficient. One example to promote handwashing in schools is the “three-star approach” by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students comply with other hygiene requirements.
By respecting minimum standards, schools can eventually be upgraded from one star to three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotional measures for hand washing to reduce disease and mortality in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness programs aimed at changing people’s behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost due to disability.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more economical than other measures.
For the first time, the importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable situations such as newly born mothers or hospitalized wounded soldiers – was highlighted in the mid-19th century by two of the hands health pioneers: the Hungarian physician, Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, and the modern nurse, Florence Nightingale, who was English.
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant smell called myasma.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of food-related diseases and health-care-related infections led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect yourself from infectious diseases.
For example, posters titled “Right Handwashing Methods” were installed alongside handwashing sinks in public toilets and toilets in German office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing someone’s hands” means expressing a person’s unwillingness to take responsibility for a matter or share it.
The term is borrowed from the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Christ, but the term is now used in some English societies with much wider use.
In Macbeth Shakespeare, Mrs. Macbeth, in an attempt to remove an imaginary stain, washes her hands forcibly, indicating her guilty conscience for the crimes she had committed and persuading her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others after recalling or contemplating immoral actions.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a deepening are less likely to participate in other “cleaning” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing and the use of water and not soap to wash hands are part of the ritual of hand washing that is recommended in many religions including Baha'i, Hinduism, Tula and Natilat Yad<0xC4><0xAB>m in Judaism.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam mandate washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands before and after each meal.
Control the risks associated with COVID-19 in the workplace.
Controlling the risks associated with COVID-19 in the workplace means using safe hygiene methods to control the risks in order to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate risk control in the workplace depends on the workplace and the type of job, and should be based on the assessment of risk sources, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for employees who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations are less likely to come in contact with ordinary people and other colleagues, and they recommend basic measures to prevent infections, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and maintaining daily hygiene and disinfecting the workplace.
Jobs that are moderately at risk include jobs where employees need frequent contact or close contact with people who have not been infected or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with the general public, for example, in schools, workplaces with high population density, and in some retail stores with high volumes of people.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes air ventilation through high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protection and personal protective equipment in case of exposure to someone with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognizes health care workers who are in contact with people who are infected or suspected to have COVID-19, including those who are at high risk. If employees are doing work that results in the production of airborne particles or samples from people with or suspected to have high risk of COVID-19, they are collecting, relocating or handling too much.
A suitable method for controlling risk for these individuals involves engineering controls such as creating negative pressure ventilation rooms and using personal protective equipment tailored to the job task.
The spread of COVID-19 can have different effects on the workplace.
Employees may not come to work due to illness, need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Business patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are needed and in terms of the way they are accessed (such as shopping during non-business hours or shopping through home delivery services or car shopping).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped. Necessary preparations and programs that can be used to respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide protective measures.
These programs examine the level of risk associated with workplaces and various occupational tasks, including sources of disease exposure, risk factors from the home and community environment, and individual risk factors for employees, such as ageing or chronic illnesses.
It also describes the necessary control measures to address those risks, as well as possible plans to deal with situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Necessary preparations and plans to respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
Objectives of the disease response include reducing disease transmission between employees, protecting those most vulnerable to health side effects, maintaining business activities, and minimizing the negative impact on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the areas where business activities take place affects the decisions made.
The risk-control hierarchy includes a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health, through which risk-control can be categorized according to their effectiveness.
In cases where it is not possible to eliminate the risks of COVID-19, the most effective methods are controls, engineering controls followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls require keeping employees away from the risks of work without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution that can be applied.
Administrative controls include changes to the policy or method of work performed by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but it can partially prevent exposure to the virus.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to employees, properly installed (e.g., the respiratory system), worn continuously and properly, inspected, maintained and replaced regularly, properly removed, cleaned, and properly maintained or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have fewer contacts with ordinary people and their colleagues.
Basic measures to prevent infection in all workplaces include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, observing respiratory practices such as covering their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, preparing to work remotely or in intermittent shifts, encouraging employees not to use tools and cleaning equipment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected people is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and other people in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home as long as they are free of fever, fever symptoms and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever reducer or other symptom-modifying medication, and that leave policies should be flexible.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), medium-risk occupations include occupations where employees need frequent contact or close contact with people less than six feet (1.8 m) apart who have not or are not suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may become infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus at the community level or due to international travel in areas where COVID-19 is widespread.
This includes employees who are in contact with the public, e.g., in places like schools, workplaces with high densities of population and some crowded retailers. Those who are in need of personalized care, personalized care, personalized care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient care, in-patient, in-patient care-car, in-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car-car
Employees in this risk group rarely need to use a respiratory system.
If a person falls ill on the plane, appropriate ways to protect staff and other passengers can include separating the patient from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning only one of the crew to serve the patient and providing the patient with a face mask, or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
The aircraft’s crew should wear disposable medical gloves when taking care of a sick passenger or when in contact with contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and should use more personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be placed in a biosafety bag and contaminated surfaces must then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the control of hazards includes postponement of sick travel, individual quarantine, and in case of fever or other symptoms while traveling, immediately notify the medical center within the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the cabin of the quarantined person. For schools and child care centers, if the infected person has entered the school building regardless of the outbreak in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends closing the site for a short time for cleaning or disinfecting.
If there is low or moderate disease transmission in the community, the following measures can be implemented in the direction of social distancing: cancelling scientific excursions, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or choirs or eating in a cafeteria, increasing the distance between the tables, spacing between arrival and departure times, restricting unnecessary visitors and separating use of health facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
When there is a significant risk of disease transmission in the community, long-term closures of schools should be considered in addition to social distancing procedures. For law enforcement personnel carrying out their day-to-day activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers their immediate health risk low.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with people with or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the guidelines that emergency medical technicians follow, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during arrest, employees must clean and disinfect their belts and appliances before re-use using a household cleaner spray or handkerchief, while also following standard procedures for the use and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers, including those at high risk.
High-risk occupations include healthcare, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who have been exposed to people who have or suspected of contracting COVID-19.
Employees whose work leads to the production of airborne particles or collects, moves, or handles samples of people with or suspected to have COVID-19 are at a very high risk.
Works that lead to the production of airborne particles include tubing, induction of cough, bronchoscopy, and some operations and dental examinations or invasive sampling of the patient.
Jobs at very high risk include staff preparing the bodies of people who were infected or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 at the time of death. The risk level is very high if the autopsy is carried out. Additional engineering control methods for this group include setting up separate rooms for patients with or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, including when doing airborne work that leads to the production of particles.
Negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate for some health and wellness centers.
Patient samples should be treated with level 3 biometric precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newcomers be kept in a separate waiting room if they suspect COVID-19. In addition to using other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of a respiratory device for those working within the 6-foot range of patients with or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, as well as for those who cause airborne defects.
In the United States, the N95 respirator filter is approved by the NIOSH, according to the provisions of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide more protection and make it easier for employees to use. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of full-body coverage because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of surgical masks to screen people at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or face shields, gloves and gloves for people who collect respiratory samples from or care for patients with COVID-19 and carry them without doing anything that would lead to the production of airborne particles.
In the event of a work done during which particles are produced in the air, the surgical mask will be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is not enough, the World Health Organization recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: conducting medical examinations in person, creating physical barriers such as installing transparent windows, allowing entry into the room only to people who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, not using personal protective equipment, and not using personal protective equipment to monitor people who are sick, not only doing certain things, using a respirator while taking care of multiple patients.

This month we see ourselves in remarkable conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly sheds light on the global continuity of human beings and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response to empathy, cooperation and community building is at the heart of this organization.
The companionship and level of care we’ve seen among our colleagues through email, contact, and chat represent the incredible people we have the opportunity and the privilege of working with.
I am so grateful and honored to have you all here as a partner.
Last week, someone appreciated what we were doing.
They remind me of how meaningful it is that the world can now refer to Wikipedia, and what a powerful sign this important resource can be made available online.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites up-to-date or our colleagues get paid or our communities are safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information Wikipedia provides.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from the beginning of next week.
Adjustments to our work and plans
As Robin noted earlier, Team-C met last night to discuss our approach and plan for the coming days and months.
“During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the right answer to what we’re facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We wanted to relieve stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce it, it’s okay.
To all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Until further notice, we expect to work 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We’re not announcing a holiday – if you can work more regular hours, you’ll benefit from this mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re taking care of your loved ones, buying food, or going to the doctor, your health is our top priority.
We do not track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
There’s no need to take sick leave or personal leave – just tell your manager and help your group browse calendars and schedules and make sure someone is covering key tasks.
(If your COVID-19 test result is positive, please let Bryan know from the T&C department so that T&C can help you and make sure your situation is handled properly.)
Employees who work an hourly wage are paid in full.
As we have said before, we are committed to our commitments to contractors and colleagues working on an hourly basis.
All wages are paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stress to the world around us.
What we do, especially in such situations, can be very valuable.
Again, it’s about taking care of yourself.
We ask that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and be able to plan accordingly.
Some things are considered urgent.
There are resources that we need to do them.
Teams of SRE, HR Ops, trust and safety, and fundraising (and some others) are doing essential and important work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with other departments to assess current goals and focus on supporting the essentials for our mission.
There is a lot of work for all of us, we will all focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow down the process now, we won’t get hurt later.
We don’t have a plan to do twice as much work as we do now as soon as the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are now impossible.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines if necessary.
How's the yearly plan?
To match the new realities and expectations of the daily working hours, we plan to adjust our 2021-2020 annual schedule delivery schedule.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 program, which gives us more time to budget, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and caring for their loved ones, while also allowing those who need or wish to work less hours over the next few weeks.
This extension greatly reduces the pressure of current work schedules throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and inform the representatives and teams in the next steps as soon as it is approved.
Thanks to the annual planning team for leading this job.
Office status, exposure to disease and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a SF-based colleague may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, for more caution, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade anti-virus solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevators next to our floor.
The building uses its own care protocol and uses products that are beneficial to the health of its residents.
We are confident that when we decide to return, the office will be well-prepared.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff.
According to the San Francisco State Guidelines, since last week, our Washington DC office has become a completely remote collection.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we’ve also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Older colleagues who work remotely with us know that this can be an adaptation of the situation and want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of the sessions to one or two hours maximum.
If longer sessions are needed, check how they can be held over a few days.
Make the meeting clear, have a schedule, and send the necessary reading material in advance.
Set the video up by default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and communication.
Appoint someone to lead the meeting, someone to supervise the chat to keep track of questions and lists of speakers, and someone to take notes (or share notes).
If you need a comfortable headphone, send an email to the technical support team.
Make use of your health allowance for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to talk about the split work with your colleagues.
The Human Resources Operations team is seeking webinar-based ergonomic guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of foundation-level financial concessions such as editathon to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia until the World Health Organization announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we know that our request for cancellation of programs and other restrictions can make it impossible to carry out agreed activities related to receiving financial concessions, and that no one will be punished for delaying or amending their purposes.
Next week we will provide further instructions on Wikimania and other thematic and regional social conferences.
It seems that the general feeling across the global community is both distressed by these disorders and at the same time relieved by their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikimedia, and so on.
As we move forward, CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and maintain our connections with them.
Staying in touch on COVID-19 related issues
We will send a meeting invitation to special staff to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC time with 07:00 PT time.
We will use this time to provide you with new and more information, answer your questions, and spend some time communicating with each other.
We are all in this together and we are here to help you in every way possible.
Meanwhile, you can find relevant information through this email and other COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
The CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We are also trying to establish regular contact with those of our employees who are resident in countries that are already significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, mainstream work or news coverage challenges, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you if necessary.
If you want to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - Director of International Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as giving up our work and our commitments.
Rather, it shows that at this moment our work and our commitments probably need to adapt to a way we haven’t done in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work and support our movement and provide the services the world relies on.
The things we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
It's time to support each other and create space for the important things to be done in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to realize this, so we want you to take care of yourself and your families so you can be at your best when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the team leadership (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N.)
b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) transducer enzyme is an enzyme that binds to the external surface of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 disrupts the activity of the angiotensin-associated enzyme transducer (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing (Ang(1-7), which makes it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a point of entry into the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-2-converter enzyme is a type of zinc-containing metallurgy found on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidease range of M2 and a C-terminal colectin carrier amino acid amino acid range.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose enzymatic active range is located near the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular amplitude of ACE2, along with another enzyme called shadaz, is separated from the amplitude of the amplitude, and the soluble protein is eventually excreted by urine after entering the bloodstream.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 sticks to the cell membrane of type II bubble cells, mainly lung, small intestine entropy, artery and vein endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Signs of ACE2 mRNA are seen in the brain's cortex, cortical body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE neutralizer.
ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin narrowing vein II.
ACE2 in turn separates the phenyl-alanine amino acid carboxyl-terminal from angiotensinII (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and converts angiotensin into angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Phe).
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides, such as [des-Arg9]-Bradykine, appline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane flow of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and plays a role in the development of Hartnap disease.
ACE2, as a contraceptive protein, plays a key role in cell entry for some coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-factor virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19-factor virus).
More importantly, sticking to the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses to the enzymatic range of ACE2 at the cellular level leads to the incubation and transfer of viruses and enzymes in endosomes within cells.
This entry process requires the preparation of S protein by the host serin protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition in the current research process as a possible treatment is under investigation. The hypothesis is that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional communities and regulatory bodies have suggested that treatment with standard ACE inhibitors and ARBs continue.
A rule-based and meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012, found that “use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% drastically reduced risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
Meanwhile, “the risk of pneumonia decreased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were more likely to develop pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less likely to develop pneumonia compared to the overall results.”
It is thought that recurrent human ACE (rhACE2) is a new treatment for acute lung injury and appears to improve respiratory hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory dystrophy caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of the action is 30 minutes plus the duration of the effect (duration) is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with sensitivity to systemic and classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or angiotensin II circulatory booster diseases. The effect of rhACE2 injection on clinical trials for treatment of acute respiratory dystrophy is assessed.
b'COVID-19 applications are mobile application applications used to track contact during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people (communications) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous programs have been developed or proposed to have the support of government officials in some territories and regions.
Numerous frameworks have been developed for the preparation of contact tracing programs.
There have been problems with privacy, especially in systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
One of the less interventional solutions is to use Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would include support for Bluetooth-oriented applications directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed a program that allows citizens to find out if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
The program is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is used.
The program has been developed by the local IT community, published open-source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has released a Bluetooth-based program called "StopKorona!" to intercept possible contacts with infected people and provide an immediate response to therapeutic authorities.
The program has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app has been awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the call tracking program is in an advanced stage of development and will be ready to deploy in a few weeks. A similar program (“StopCovid”) will be implemented in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering plans based on the TraceTogether program and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geographic limitation program for COVID-19 patients and residents of Moscow to prevent these people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, pointed to a number of application problems related to program-oriented systems, including false positive results and possible inefficiencies if the program is used in small population samples.
Apple has imposed restrictions on the type of organizations that are allowed to add coronavirus apps to the App Store by examining the problems associated with the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” programs and only allowing “official” or “accredited” organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of public surveillance using coronavirus programs, and have specifically stated that it is unclear whether the surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be removed after the threat is lifted.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for a curtailment of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have listed eight conditions for government schemes:
Monitoring must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Surveillance extensions should have the possibility of automatic cancellation;
The use of data should be limited to cases related to COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be ensured and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should not be a ground for intensification of discrimination and isolation;
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be taken to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to complain of abuse;
Targeted participation of all "relevant stakeholders" including public health experts and marginalized groups is essential. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
The proposed Google/Apple app aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device’s operating systems after fixing the need.
In some countries, instead of the app, network-driven locating process has been used, and as a result, the need to download the app and the ability to escape the interception has been eliminated.
In Israel, network-based interception has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data may violate privacy.
However, not all central server systems require access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems use central servers only for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-programmed system was used to track calls.
Instead of using a specialized program, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and used it to send text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to communicate to potential audiences, the government has made location information available to the public. This type of information disclosure has been permitted due to widespread changes in the data protection laws in the country due to the outbreak of MERS.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Some countries, such as Germany, have taken into account the use of centralized systems and privacy protection.
As of April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been disclosed.
Contact privacy tracking is an accepted concept that dates back to at least 2013, with dozens of expert groups working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that involves centralized and decentralized approaches and is not an independent protocol. From decentralized protocols, we can refer to “Decentralized Close Privacy Leadership” (DP-PPT/DP-3T), “Current Contact Numbers” (TCN, known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), “Privacy Protocols”.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data is never removed from the device, and all correspondence occurs within the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy protection practices in the process of collecting and consuming data, locating and routing, to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform is based on the research results outlined in the official report “Application Disability: Privacy During the Pandemic” released in March 2020. Another similar initiative is SafeTrace, the Enigma MPC product. The company is developing privacy technologies developed at MIT Media Lab.
With secure hardware technologies, SafeTrace allows users to provide sensitive location and health data to other users and authorities without violating data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups. These groups came together on the basis of what were essentially similar and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing the dispersion and providing a framework for global cooperation in the field of tracking and alerting programs, key aspects of achieving broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol available to the public in its official government program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the controllers of Android and iOS mobile platforms, unveiled a call-tracking initiative that they claim is going to protect privacy. The initiative is based on a combination of “low-energy” Bluetooth technology and privacy encryption.
They have also released the specifications of the main technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three phases:
Introducing Government Empowerment Tools to Create Coronavirus Interception Programs with Privacy Capabilities
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to address the problem of continuous adoption and monitoring by distributing the system through an update to the operating system and then removing it in a similar way once the threat is resolved.
Substitution of a drug (known as change of application, change of profile, change of duty or transfer of medication) is the change in the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or physical problem different from that for which the drug was originally developed.
This is a pathway of scientific research to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research objectives include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transmission of recovered plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 pharmaceutical proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these connection sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papillae-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofosphatase.
Hussein A A et al. reviewed several proposed drugs, which were then optimized for their skeletal similarity with the most approved drugs, to speed up the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a preclinical study that was to be proposed in the design of the clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs studied in a clinical trial of "unity".
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate with an “Emergency Use Permit” (EUA).
It has not been approved by the FDA in the clinical trial process, and its use is permitted according to the EUA only for experimental treatment and emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive the drug in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that “the need, amount, or duration of use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been determined.
Doctors have said they will take these medicines if there is “no other option.”
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey, is implementing a small research project on the use of chloroquine along with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Widespread studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of preventive hydroxychloroquine use.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China, claimed favipiravir was “completely effective.”
The test results were negative in 35 patients on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Agency reminded the public that the available evidence for the effectiveness of the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its reserves and would use the military to deliver the drug to training hospitals, where it would use the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered to buy the drug to the Trump administration, which may not be as effective in treating acute cases where the virus has been replicated.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or people who want to get pregnant.
A review of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, found that “no benefit was observed.”
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV proliferation by sticking to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Criticisms have been raised in the scientific community about directing resources to change the use of drugs designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international “unity” trial.
Gilead Sciences developed the drug Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola viral disease and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later determined that Remdesivir was active in the laboratory against viruses such as Philo, Pneumo, Paramixo and Corona.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the creation of resistance through mutations that may lead to more severe diseases and outbreaks.
Some pre-trial studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic barrier to resistance formation. Several clinical trials are underway, including two of which are hosted by Cleveland Educational Hospital. One includes people with mild disease and the other people with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials on the effect of intravenous intravenous injection of vitamin C on people hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Two of them are controlled by a placebo (China and Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began antibiotic trials on azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to run a clinical trial for Alvesco Tijin (Cyclonide), a type of inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with symptoms and infected with the new coronavirus.

Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute of Canada are studying the role of chloroquine in reducing inflammation and respiratory consequences in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
In the study, known as colcrona, 6,000 patients, at least 40 years old, who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have mild and unnecessarily hospitalized symptoms, were enrolled.
Pregnant or lactating women, or women who use effective contraceptive methods, are not eligible to participate in the study.
Several blood coagulation drugs are under investigation in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, and for this reason the Italian Medical Agency is required to release its prescription.
A multi-center study involving 300 patients was announced on April 14 in Italy to assess the effect of sodium enoxaparin on dosage prevention and treatment.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a type of virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on changing the use of antiviral drugs developed to treat previous infectious diseases such as MERS, SARS, and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin proposed in accordance with 7 China edition guidelines for COVID-19 treatment
Omi Phenovir has been recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in China, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese edition.
Antibiotics that have been proposed as a possible alternative to COVID-19 treatments include:
Tokilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to become available sooner than the next 18 months.
The five vaccines proposed in April were under Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A massive global outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use released genomes to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development were speed, production capacity, scale deployment, and universal access.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were under development in early 2020 to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main objectives of the platform that entered Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Recommended: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (Phase I developer and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which have been approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others have been made public, but not much information is available to the public (assuming they are in the planning or design phase).
The Phase I-II trial examines safety and immunization preliminaries, usually randomized and controlled with placebo, run at different centers, and determines more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants in a control group and monitor adverse effects in optimal doses while assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in pre-clinical trials).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was researching the ability of the vaccine to genetically modify viral proteins and simulate the immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of the research on a vaccine that is scheduled to begin human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development plans were introduced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, under the management of Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had started the vaccine development process.
Janssen, in partnership with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen Laboratories in Romania published an article about the design of a vaccine with the same technology used to treat cancer neo-antigens.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the development of the vaccine and were in the early stages of testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Genex, announced that it had begun a plan to develop a Li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to develop a vaccine that could be tested on humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans for vaccine development.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Facilities Center in Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Institute for Military Research in Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax.
The development and production of the vaccine has been announced.
The partners later announced that they would be conducting a pre-clinical trial and phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that 11 people are being tested in quarantine and that the development of the vaccine in the shortest possible time will take at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, an active biotechnology company in Quebec City, the province of Quebec, announced the development of a particle-like coronavirus with a partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
The proposed vaccine is in the lab research phase, and human trials are scheduled to take place in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had proposed to CureVac to provide “exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine in exchange for a huge sum of money” that the German government had opposed.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
The proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is currently in the pre-clinical trial phase and clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that the results of their pre-clinical trials would be ready in April 2020 and that their proposed final vaccine could be tested on humans before the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vin, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. With this investment, the total development capital of the COVID-19 vaccine reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing six different proposed vaccines on animals.
Researchers at the Royal College of London announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-stimulating RNA vaccine to combat COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving sequencing information from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a $275 million Canadian fundraising effort to fund 96 research projects to tackle COVID-19, including several proposed vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced that it had earmarked $192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plans to create a national "vaccination bank" consisting of several new vaccines, with usability in case of other coronavirus outbreaks.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the PittCovacc, a proposed COVID-19 vaccine, on mice, and announced that “subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines with MNAs eliminated strong antigen-specific antigen responses [in mice] that had been revealed two weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a proposed DNA-based vaccine, possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacterial agents, this DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles. This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry sector and three U.S. universities merged their resources to access IBM’s supercomputers as well as cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous or nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another randomized trial in Australia is set to register 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective in the production phase.
Preliminary research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using animal patterns specific to COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrates the need for Level 3 biosafety prevention measures to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine to treat or prevent SARS that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is no effective vaccine against MERS.
During the MERS outbreak, it was thought that current research on MERS would likely provide a useful framework for the development of vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that had undergone phase I clinical trials in humans, and there were three other vaccines that were all carriers of the virus. There were two Adenovirus-portant vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and an MVA-portant vaccine (MVA-MERS).
Publicized views on social media have promoted a conspiracy theory about the known COVID-19 virus and the existence of a vaccine for it.
The inventions mentioned on various social media refer to previous inventions related to genetic sequences and vaccines related to other coronavirus variants, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease known to cause acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of hearing, and abdominal pain.
The time interval between exposure to the pathogen to symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
While most cases lead to mild symptoms, some cases lead to viral pneumonia and multi-organ defects.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported worldwide from 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly transmitted through close contact, often through small droplets caused by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
While exhalation causes the release of these droplets, droplets usually fall on the ground or surfaces rather than on long-distance transmission.
People may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
The virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The risk of infection is higher in the first three days after the onset of symptoms. Of course, it is possible to spread the virus before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the chain reaction of rRT-PCR from the nasopharynx swab.
Wearing a mask is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and those around them.
The recommendation to wear a mask is different for the general public; some officials oppose the use of the mask, some agree, and some make it mandatory to wear a mask.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries in all six regions covered by the WHO.
People with the virus may be without symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest area, dizziness, difficulty walking and bruising of the face or lips. If these symptoms do not go away, you should see your doctor immediately.
Symptoms of the upper respiratory tract, such as sore throat, runny nose or sore throat, are also less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in variable percentages.
Some cases in China in the early stages had only shortness of breath and severe heart palpitations.
In others, the disease may continue until the stage of pneumonia, multi-organ defects, and even death.
This period is called a period of infertility.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms appear within 11.5 days from the moment of infection. Reports show that not all infected people necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these symptom-free carriers in the transmission process is not yet clear. Of course, preliminary evidence suggests that these individuals can cause outbreaks.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is under investigation. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has said that 20% of all confirmed cases remain untreated during hospitalization.
The National Commission on China's Health (NCHC) began to include no-symptomatic cases on April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infections reported that day at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry the virus.
Talking loudly scatters more particles than speaking slowly.
Researchers in Singapore have proven that not covering your mouth and nose while coughing may cause tiny droplets to be released up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually aerobic, the National Academy of Sciences has stated that there is a possibility of airborne transmission, and that positive RNA-related RNA samples have been found in air collectors installed in the corridors outside the person's room.
Certain medical procedures, such as tubing and heart-breathing (CPR), may cause respiratory discharges to spread and spread the virus through the air.
While there are concerns about the transmission of the virus through stools, this is a less likely assumption. The risk of transmission of the virus through people with symptoms is higher. The risk of transmission of the virus is lower before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said that despite the uncertain mechanism of transmission, each person usually infects two to three people. The duration of the virus on surfaces is several hours to several days.
Specifically, the virus on the cardboard survived for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for a maximum of four hours.
Of course, this time depends on humidity and temperature.
The correct use of soap and detergent is also effective. Soap products remove the layer of the virus’s fat protection, disable it, and remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chloroxidine (surgical detoxification), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed high viral load, and in the sixth, the highest viral load was seen in the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first diagnosed in Wuhan from three people with pneumonia and associated with acute respiratory disease cases.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in related coronaviruses.
The virus kills outside the human body with homemade soap. Its protective bubble soap kills. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs as the virus enters the host cell through the enzyme 2, which is abundant in type II lung bubble cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike (polymer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was observed in 12% of infected people and hospitalized in Wuhan. This is more common in severe cases.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders in the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and play a role in heart activity.
High incidence rates of thrombosis (31%) and vascular thromboembolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor diagnosis. Autopsies of people who have died of COVID-19 have indicated diffuse bubble damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammation in the lungs.
While SARS-CoV-2 tends to be ACE2-containing respiratory cells, there have been signs of severe systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells with the absorption of inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients has been proven.
Lymphocyte penetration has also been reported during the autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard diagnostic method is the polymerase chain reaction of instant reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained with a nasopharynx swab. Of course, a nasal swab or sputum sample is also used.
Results are usually ready within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can also be used, but it requires taking two blood samples at a two-week interval. In this type of test, the direct result is not worth much.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and release its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to run independent polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect viral infections.
As of April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infections and a person's history of infection) were under study, but not yet widely used.
The accuracy of this Chinese experiment is only 60-70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care spot test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Zhongnan Hospital Diagnostic Guidelines from Wuhan University have suggested methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical characteristics and pandemic risk.
The opacity of multi-lobule double-sided matte glass with a lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution is used to detect early stages of infection.
Subcutaneous dominance, defective coating (thickness of the lebule blade with variable bubble filling) and stiffness may be a sign of progression of the disease.
Little is known about the microscopic and pathophysiological damage caused by COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pneumonia, pericarditis, heart stiffness and respiratory edema
Four levels of viral pneumonia are visible:
Mild pneumonia: respiratory edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large abnormal pneumonia, intestinal inflammation with lymphocyte penetration and large multi-nuclear cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Dispersed bubble damage (DAD) with dispersed bubble discharge.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Improving pneumonia: formation of secretions in bubble cavities and fibrosis of the respiratory tract
Blood: Dispersed intravenous clotting (DIC); leucorrheoblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a paper napkin when coughing and sneezing and using the inner part of the elbow if it is not available.
Hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is strongly recommended.
The CDC has proposed the use of cloth masks in public places to partially prevent the spread of the disease by people without symptoms. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact between infected people with large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include keeping a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) between people.
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since the discovery of a vaccine is not envisaged until at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, or “flatten the curve.”
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important after leaving the toilet or becoming exposed to contaminated hands, before eating and after draining the nose, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand alcohol disinfectant with alcohol content of at least 60% in the absence of soap and water. For areas where conventional hand detergents are not available, the WHO has provided two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
To remove alcohol microbial hogs, hydrogen peroxide is used; “it is not an active ingredient for hand sterilization.”
Glycerol is added as a moisture preservative.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid-treatment, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs damaged.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of having it should wear a simple mask.
Extrinsic membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being explored.
Individual hygiene and lifestyle changes and family diets have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive therapies may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the China National Health Commission have made suggestions for care for people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Intensive care professionals and lung specialists in the United States have compiled treatment proposals from various institutions in the form of a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To alleviate the symptoms, some medical professionals have identified the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) for first-line use better than ibuprofen.
To minimize the possibility of transmission of the virus, it is necessary to take precautions, especially in treatment areas where procedures are carried out for the release of suspended particles, such as pipes or manual ventilation.
For therapists who take care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping an individual in an aerobic infection quarantine room (AIIR) and using standard precautions, contact prevention measures and aerobic precautions. The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Suggested devices include PPE guns, respirator masks or face masks, eye protection and surgical gloves. If available, use a respirator mask (in place of a face mask) is a priority.
The N95 respirator has been approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has approved the use of the mask with an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The mask is designed to protect against aerobic particles such as dust, but its effectiveness is not guaranteed against certain biological factors for consumption outside the original application.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or as a last resort, handmade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or alternative methods, but a percentage of them require these measures.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-induced respiratory failure is under investigation in hospitalized people. Some evidence suggests that ventilation can be prevented with a high flow-through nose cannula or double-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
Whether either of the two methods leads to similar benefits in ill patients is not yet clear.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, if any, because this method limits the amount of fine particles dispersing compared to high-flow nasal cannulas. The incidence of severe cases is higher in the elderly (people over 60, and especially those over 80).
In many developed countries, per capita hospital beds are not enough. As a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization has been limited.
In a study in China, it was found that 5% of those infected were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 will eventually be treated in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) becomes more severe in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes far more difficult.
To maximize oxygen conductivity and reduce the likelihood of lung damage associated with aerosol and chest cavities, it is necessary to use aerosols with high pressure and PPEP control modes.
Older air carriers may not have high PEEP.
The investigation into possible treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial stage.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising among the drugs.
While the development of new drugs will take until 2021, several of the drugs under trial have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO has suggested that volunteers participate in trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of possible drugs. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of recovered plasma as a trial treatment, if the person’s life is severely or completely at risk.
The drug has not gone through clinical studies to prove the effectiveness and safety of the disease.
In February 2020, China unveiled a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can identify the 'closest contact' with the help of surveillance data and detect the likelihood of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is identified, the app will report the issue to local health authorities in addition to offering a home quarantine offer. From macro-data analysis on mobile, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected people and related people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government made it possible for security agencies to track mobile data from people suspected of COVID-19.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom provided the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, with cumulative phone location data to help investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify people who are in quarantine.
Giulio Gallera, a regional health officer in Italy, has been informed by mobile operators that “40% of people still travel freely.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 people.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection may make people tense.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental stress and economic problems can change people’s mental and physical health.”
It may be symptomatic or asymptomatic at some stage, and may cause complications such as other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold.
Mild cases usually improve within two weeks, but people with severe or acute illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be among the high-risk groups for COVID-19; however, little is known about COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In unwell people, COVID-19 may quickly become acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and cause respiratory failure, infection shock, or multi-organ defects.
Consequences of COVID-19 include infection, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of people who were hospitalized due to COVID-19. The prevalence of kidney failure was 4%.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen signs of increased liver enzyme secretion (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time interval between the appearance of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five days were related to hospitalization.
Of course, in patients transferred to the ICU, the average time interval between hospitalization and death was reported to be seven days.
A recent study found that the average time interval between the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days reported.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China found that the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Tissue-traumatic examinations of the lungs of dead people indicate dispersed bubble damage and cellular fibromyalgia discharge in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been seen in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to that of the lung with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported in China’s National Health Commission report, an increase in troponin or heart attack rates caused heart damage.
According to data from the U.S. March, 89% of hospitalized people are already ill. Accessibility to medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affects the death rate.
Estimates of mortality from this disease vary due to regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
A small number of mild cases may cause an overestimation of the fatality rate.
Of course, the fact that deaths were a result of previous infections may mean that current mortality rates have been underestimated.
Smokers, compared to non-smokers, are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or diet. The long-term consequences of the disease have raised concerns.
The Hong Kong Department of Hospitals reported a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease and the presence of organ damage symptoms in the lung scan.
This condition may lead to special post-care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether a history of effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease was caused.
The incidence of immunity is based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, the test has also been positive in people recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that these cases are caused by the deterioration of the infection and not by re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, through overflowing infection.
The exact origin is unclear, but by December 2019, the outbreak was almost entirely based on human-to-human transmission.
By examining 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the first case of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the date of the first cases of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
To measure mortality, different metrics are usually used.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent on the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 U07.1 for death from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 for death from COVID-19 subject to clinical or epidemiological diagnosis without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory. The death rate is achieved by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies from region to region. Other measurement scales include the Case Mortality Rate (CFR) which determines the percentage of people diagnosed who die from the disease. The Infectious Mortality Rate (IFR) is another criterion that determines the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who die from the disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from the infection stage to the closure of the case.
Although not all infected people necessarily produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people are infected.
In the small village of 4,600 people, Castiglione d’Adda, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Italy, 80 people (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals. Infection among young people caused the death rate to be relatively lower. However, some cases of COVID-19 deaths have not officially been included in the death category due to the virus.
Meanwhile, the German health system has maintained its efficiency.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have developed antibodies based on blood donors assessments.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed as a result of COVID-19.
The effect of the pandemic and its fatality rate varies between men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, higher mortality rates were reported in men.
The highest risk of infection is in men over the age of 50. This gap between men and women disappears at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are not clear, but genetic and behavioral factors may affect it.
Gender-based immunological differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, and more men with concomitant diseases such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people died and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not taken any action to track gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of the medical staff, especially nurses, are female and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was the official name for the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, announced that CO Corona, VI related to the virus, D stands for disease and 19 related to the time it was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to prevent referrals to specific geographical locations (such as China), animal species or groups of people, based on international nomenclature proposals and for the purpose of preventing labeling. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is called acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the term “Covid-19 virus” and “Covid-19 virus” in official communications.
The disease and the virus that causes it are collectively called the coronavirus.
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the names “Coronavirus” and “Coronavirus Wuhan” were jointly given to the virus and the disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization designated 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as temporary names for the disease. These names were chosen based on the 2015 guidelines on the avoidance of naming places for virus and disease.
Official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are producing health items such as nose swabs and parts for air carriers.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital needed an air-conditioning valve and the supplier could not deliver it on time. As a result, a local start-up engineered the reverse and produced 100 valves overnight.
After the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, inaccurate information and incomplete information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease developed and quickly spread online.
The virus appears to be transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies of finding evidence of proliferation of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens have shown no results.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is underway among government agencies, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization conducted a “Test of Unity” to assess the therapeutic impact of four of the most promising antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine yet, but various agencies are actively looking at the proposed vaccines.
The results of previous studies on SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are under investigation.
First, researchers are looking for a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of the virus, inactive or dead, is aimed at preventing an immune response in the human body from a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that can make the immune system vulnerable to some sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is based on the Spike S protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy relates to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the new method of vaccine development).
The experimental vaccines of each of these strategies should be evaluated in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains the harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody-based development has been raised as a potential challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but there is some debate.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven clinical trials evaluated treatments that had previously been approved for the treatment of malaria, including four research projects on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs are subject to a change in the application of most Chinese research, which is set to announce the results of nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, the clinical development dynamics of the COVID-19 vaccine and the proposed drugs are under review. Several antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19 are under investigation, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there was inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir without authorization.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was examined in China in February 2020, and preliminary results were published.
Of course, the research community has been invited to review these results.
Health institutions in Korea and China have suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, while the Wuhan Institute of Virology has suggested taking one gram per day, it has stated that taking a double dose is very dangerous and may be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.In China's 7th edition guidelines, the names of interferon, ribavirin or omiphenovir for the treatment of COVID-19 have been proposed.
Preliminary data show that high-dose ribavirin is necessary to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory environment.
Nitazoxanide, after its low concentration effect has been proven in inhibition of the replication of SARS-CoV-2, has been proposed for research in the human body.Research has shown that preparation of primary spike protein with transmembrane protease serin-2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin has major constraints that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without reviewing them. Oseltamivir does not inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory environment and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been proven.
Cytokine storms may be severe from the complications of later stages of COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cytokine storm properties. China’s National Health Commission has included Tokylizumab in the treatment guidelines after a brief review.
After the use of the drug in people with severe disease showed positive results, Italy underwent a non-random phase 2 national test.
By combining serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, it is used to combat the development that has led to the death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist in 2017 based on previous case studies to treat the resistant cytokine release syndrome, which is caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tokilizumab is effective for CRS treatment.
The transmission of pure and concentrated antibodies produced in the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those in need is under investigation as a non-vaccine method with passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS and the results were not conclusive.
Viral neutralization is a possible mechanism of action based on which passive antibodies-therapy provides the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity associated with antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be effective.
Other types of inactive antibodies, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies, are under investigation.
The production of the recovery serum, which includes the fluid part of the blood taken from the recovered person and contains specific antibodies to the virus, may increase for faster development.
Diseases caused by coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at the Wuhan Central Hospital, later died of COVID-19 after being notified by the public about the outbreak.
