Members of the Welsh Parliament are concerned that they will be seen as "dollars."
There are concerns among some members of parliament about the proposal to change their name to MWP (abbreviated as Member of Parliament of Wales).
This is due to plans to change the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives from all political spectrum are worried that this will make them laugh.
A member of the Welsh parliament said his group was concerned that the MWP was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
In Wales, twp means fool and pwp means feces.
A member of the Plaid party said the group was "not happy" with the nomination and suggested other options.
A member of the Conservative Party in Wales says his group is "intelligent" about the name change, but also points out that MWP is literally close to the word "muppet."
In this context, the first letter of Wales, w, is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drafting a law on the name change, said: “Of course, the final decision on any title with which members of the House are called is an important matter for the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consensus on the proposals, in which the name of the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
When it comes to the issue of designation for members of parliament, the commission is more willing to use the term “Wales Parliament Members” or WMP, but the MWP option is more supported by public consensus.
Members of the House seem to be proposing alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement could be problematic for the chairman of the meeting, Elaine Jones, as she is expected to draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the way the House works, laws relating to disqualification of members of the House, and the design of the committee’s system.
After parliamentary negotiations, members of the House will vote on the title they will be called with.
Macedonians vote for a referendum to change the country’s name to the ballot box
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
Voters are calling for a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, one of the provinces of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor reflects its claim to territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s bid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov opposed the referendum and said he would not heed the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, believe that the name change is a cost that must be paid for joining the European Union and NATO.
The bell of St. Martin's Cathedral went off like the struggle of Harlem
Mr. Adams: Historically, the old men I talked to said there was always a bar and a church in every corner.
“There is no one left today.”
Mr. Adams says it's understandable to lose a load.
He said, “Today, people are different.
“It’s not a meeting place in the neighborhood where people go on a regular basis.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to the starting point.”
He added that apartment buildings may be replaced by churches, where residents do not contribute to the sacred space remaining in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and so the day the churches close, it’s unlikely that the majority of those people who move into these apartments will join them,” she says.
Both churches were built a decade later by the white community before Harlem became a black city - by the Metropolitan Society in 1870 and Martin's Church.
The original white community of Methodist religions moved out of the city in the 1930s.
The black community worshiping nearby took up a new title for the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black community led by Pastor John Howard Johnson. The priest led the boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, and resisted black recruiting or job promotions.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when residents in the Johnson neighborhood made plans to rebuild, they also ordered a ringing (Carillon) set.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, and his successor in St. Martin, proudly called the collection “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who examined and sounded the bells in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also believes that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, and moved there 18 years ago to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather believes that St. Martin has not replaced him.
What has been circulating in St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex tale of architects and contractors, some of which were created by the church’s bakers and others by the Episcopal Church.
The clerics of the prayer room—the ruling faction, composed of non-spiritual readers—wrote a letter to the Episcopal Church in July, expressing concerns that “the Episcopal Church is seeking to transfer its expenses to the prayer room,” although the prayer room had no room for architects and contractors who were sent by the Episcopal Church.
Some people complain about the lack of transparency from the Episcopal Church.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked by a shark while diving to catch a crab.
Officials said on Saturday and the start of the season in California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel said in an interview with KSWB-TV in San Diego on Saturday morning that he was diving with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help after half an hour and immediately went swimming with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hamel explains that at first he thought the boy was excited to have a crab, but then he realized he was yelling, “She bit me!
They slapped me!”
Hamel said that by the time he reached the boy, “his entire girdle had been broken.”
Hamel continued, “I screamed that everyone should get out of the water, ‘It’s in the shark’s water.’”
The boy was taken to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed on a list of people with critical conditions.
It is not known what type of shark the attacker was.
Larry Giles, captain of the Salvation Guard, told a press conference that a shark had been discovered in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries and injuries in the upper trunk.
Authorities, to investigate and maintain safety, banned sea access for 48 hours from Punto Beach in Casablanca to Swamy in Asinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's chain store plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s has competed as a chain store with specialist cosmetic assistants in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a significant effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK, which continues to grow (while fashion and home products sales are declining), shelves of cosmetics are being tested in 11 stores across the country and will be set up in more stores if successful next year.
Investing in cosmetics offered in supermarkets is looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the amount of cosmetics to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Available ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also have more space with branded locations similar to those found in stores like Boots.
In this supermarket, the cosmetic boutique will be re-established so that most products are plant-friendly - a topic increasingly sought after by young buyers.
In addition, the fragrance store Fragrance will also have exclusive testing at two Sinsbury stores, the first of which opened last week in Craddon, South London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Buying online and changing the practice of buying small quantities of food daily in locally available stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to convince people to go to these stores.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sinesbury, says sales markets are generally more like big chain stores, and supermarkets are trying to combat the discounts at Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury’s has created several Argos stores in hundreds of stores, as well as a few Habitats stores, because two years ago it bought both chains, saying it boosted grocery sales and made shopping more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to add a cosmetic and pharmacy sector failed.
Sainsbury tried to establish a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but after a not-so-serious effort, there was trouble with how to split the income in the chemicals store and the collaboration was interrupted.
The new strategy was adopted three years ago when Sinsbury sold 281 of its drug stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds chain of pharmacies, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds was said to be playing a key role in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills Hicks, business director at Sinesbury, said: “We have changed the look and feel of the shelves of cosmetics in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We also recruited specialized and trained colleagues who will be there to provide advice.
The entire range of brands is tailored to the need, and the environment of incentives and comfortable places means that we now have a beautiful, guiding place that challenges old shopping practices.”
Peter Jones became "enraged" after Holly Willoughby turned down <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Actor Peter Jones left the show angry after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke her <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with the brand and decided to sign a new contract with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for home apparel and accessories branded Truely.
The couple’s business is similar to the brand name Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop.
The presenter of this morning’s show announced on Instagram that he had left the deal.
Holly Willoughby angered actor Peter Jones for giving up on his last-minute deal with his popular brand – to focus on new contracts with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been angry when Golden Hair TV’s daughter admitted to her new deals — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, meaning she no longer has enough time for the brand Truely, which is active in the field of home apparel and accessories.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and is said to double Willoughby's wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Thus, 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he had broken up with the company and that Jones had left the UK for one of his bungalows.
One source said: “Truly was really one of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be his long-term future and be together in the next few decades.
His decision to quit completely confused everyone.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, there was little left to begin with.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlowe’s headquarters ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the exit of this morning’s show, one of the UK’s most-moneyed stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to the company’s heavy investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to normal household clothes.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Don Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Cape, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded True with Cape in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the board of directors in March.
The couple were together and owned 40 percent of Baldwin television company Jones.
Willoughby wanted to be the M&S business ambassador, replacing Anthony McPartlin, who hosted ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his economic affairs.”
It was a difficult conversation, and then we fell in love.
He ignores the criticism of the news media for writing an opinion that some do not regard as “a disgrace to the president” and does not consider the North Korean leader to be a joke.
Why is President Trump letting things go so fast?
Trump says in his humorous voice:
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim enjoyed a second meeting with Trump after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which is a big step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ray Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “congruent response” from the United States to advance disarmament in North Korea.
He noted that in return, the United States continued to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
In his speech, Trump had a very optimistic outlook for his fans.
He said: “Our work with North Korea has been great.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of U.S. forces to the country.
And he also defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
Trump said: “It’s easy to be president, but instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this tight space, we have about 200 people standing there.”
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok became homeless, the declaration of a national disaster was not a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it’s very clear that international aid is not being sought, and so it’s a bit difficult,” Ms. Sambong said.
While the rescue team is gathering a team to travel to Palo Alto, they are still not sure if foreign workers can work in those areas.
Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were investigating the situation in Palo to see if international organizations could be allowed to help.
Despite the constant landslide that is taking place in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, there are no other beaches on these shelters.
The absence of a tsunami alert in Palo, or even a normal alert, was one of the reasons for the deaths.
At best, moving between many Indonesian islands is a challenging task.
Natural disasters make supplies more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene.
President Joko Widodo has taken steps to improve Indonesia’s old infrastructure, which was at the center of his campaign slogans, and has spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding puts Joko’s government in trouble in next year’s election.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced a conservative form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs are killed in the streets using knives, bows, spears and other violent weapons, resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of homeless.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Storridge has prevented his team from losing to Chelsea.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored his 89th goal to prevent his team from defeating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
While his team was a zero behind Chelsea, Sturridge received a pass from Shaqiri Jerdan 30 meters from the Chelsea gate.
He took the ball to his left before hitting Dirk farther.
The long shot went from the top of the penalty area to the right of the gate.
The ball was passed over goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and eventually went to the goal.
“It was just an attempt to get the ball in the right position and a player like Shaqiri is always playing as far as he can. So I tried to create as many opportunities as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kant coming and hit the ball, didn’t think much about it, just took the shot.”
Chelsea's 25-minute goal came after their Belgian star Eden Hazard won the first half by 1-0.
The Blues’ striker, after spinning near half the field, quickly reached Liverpool’s half-way point and passed the ball to Matteo Kuczynski with his back to his feet.
Kovac<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> gave the ball in the middle of the field and moved himself.
Then, with a beautiful deep shot, the ball reached Hazard within the penalty area.
Hazard left the defense and hit the ball in the opposite direction with a left foot shot from goalkeeper Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face videotape in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Agency said earlier Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake. The wave height reached 20 feet (6 meters).
The city of Paolo, which has a population of more than 380,000, is covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for allegedly stabbed to death a woman.
A criminal investigation was launched this morning after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
At 7:55 a.m., the body of a 44-year-old woman was found with knife wounds on her body in Grayson Mews neighborhood on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the murder.
Police have asked people in the area to inform the police if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, and I would like to ask those near John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard of a suspicious case to contact us.
“I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have a camera on their dashboard to contact us because their information may be vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman’s body was found in Birkenhead and was found inside the home.
This afternoon, the woman’s friends who knew her were asked to come to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were notifying one of the victims' relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't say anything when he found out what had happened.
Residents of the building have been told that it may take several hours for them to be allowed to enter and return home.
A police officer heard a man say the entire area is now known as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He kept repeating, “It’s awful.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans entered the quarantine area, while another was stopped outside the area.
A number of officers were standing inside the quarantine area and monitoring the building.
Those with information in this regard are asked to call DM <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 through the anti-criminal communication system and anonymously call 0800555111 to mention the 247 incident of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is the oldest memory ever to be struck by “historical rewriting.”
Its deportation is a poetic justice to the destruction of many British cultural and religious monuments by puritan fanatics.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
Chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “It is now inevitable to discuss the removal of Oliver Cromwell’s statues outside the Westminster Palace.
The vandalism of the British Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by the Kremlin.
Cromwell’s opposition to the law may have been victimized by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent performance by Sir William Hammo Tornickroft of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century beliefs and part of a character’s historiography that many believe is still venerable.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sydney Telegraph: “Chromole was considered by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than it is today, during the monarchy as an advocate for the parliament against external pressure.
Whether this is an accurate representation is a continuing historical debate.
What we are certain of is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the next development process of our nation, and the chromosome is a well-known personality representing one side of the division.
His achievements as a patron of the Lord are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
A pig with a nose killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
According to the South China Morning newspaper, the man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found near a pig in Lipanshhui market in Guizhou province, with his artery cut and blood all over.
On May 30, 2005, in Jining, China’s Qinghai province, a pig farmer was preparing a vaccine for swine flu.
According to reports, he arrived in the city on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin noticed that he was dead and the neighbor's pork door was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pig's mouth with blood.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg pig attacked the farmer with his nose and caused his death.
According to the Goyang newspaper, the deceased’s cousin, named Wu, said: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and crushed.”
Security camera footage shows the yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed this man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening newspaper that the pig had been closed to prevent people from attacking, while police collected evidence from the scene.
It is reported that the Yuan family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Previously, there have been cases of pig attacks on humans, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilo-pound pig drove a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife frightened the animal and drove him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
He said, “Pigs are just gamers.
They bite and are very curious ... not out there that can hurt you.
You just have to respect them as much as possible.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rains in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, the Rosa storm has weakened as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Typhoon Rosa, which is part of Category 1 hurricanes, with a wind speed of 137 km/h, occurred at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning in the eastern United States, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low-pressure waves will begin to form over the Pacific Ocean and move toward the east and west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches on Monday as a tropical storm hits the Baja California peninsula, intense tropical humidity is directed toward the northwest coast of the United States.
Rosa causes up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity interacting with low pressure waves will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain can cause sudden dangerous flooding, waste water flow, and possibly landslides in the plains.
Severe tropical humidity will increase precipitation in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, to 50-75 mm/h.
Rainfall is expected in parts of southwestern Arizona, especially in many parts of Arizona, around 50 to 100 mm.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden floods occur and the situation is rapidly deteriorating.
Due to the risk of tropical rains, it is strongly recommended to avoid walking in plains.
Heavy rains cause deep valleys to turn into roaring rivers, and storms will cause winds accompanied by dust.
The waves will cause heavy local rainfall in parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 12 mm is likely to cause water flow along with waste and slippery roads.
This will be the first regional rainfall in the wet season.
Tropical rains are likely to occur in Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, which will be more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will hit the four corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, we will see drastic temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this condition leads to dramatic temperature changes at short intervals.
On Sunday, there will be a great example of temperature difference across the entire central part of the United States.
There will be a roughly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of late summer will remain and will rise again.
Many parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have warm days in early October, with temperatures in the southern plains reaching 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday may rise to 27 degrees Celsius, about 6 degrees above average.
Weather forecasts for the first half of October suggest higher-than-average temperatures are likely to be high in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people attended Bert Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday through six television channels presenting evidence in the country’s Supreme Court by Christiane Blassey Ford on Brett Cavanaugh’s alleged rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued and routine television broadcasts were suspended until the last minute on Friday: a contract designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake with the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh was drinking and trying to get his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh says he’s 100% sure that didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the incident reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company has counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC news channels.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that reported the incident, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually doesn’t have the ability to count the people who watched the show in the offices.
To visualize the subject, this audience size is almost equal to the viewers of a football game or the Oscars.
Nielsen said Fox News, whose executives strongly supported Cavanaugh’s appointment, had an average of 5.69 million viewers, ahead of all other networks.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN, there were 3.1 million, 2.94 million, 2.89 million and 2.52 million viewers, respectively.
The attention and interest of the audience remained after the hearing.
Flick played the lead role in Friday's play.
After the moderate Republican office announced it was voting in favor of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS showed him on Friday that he was going to the elevator of the courtroom amidst the protests.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes while others blamed him, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the people?
The man said, “When many women are powerless, you are powerful.”
Flick said his office issued a statement saying he wanted to say more at the committee hearing before the elevator was closed.
Cable and broadcasting networks covered the issue when the Judiciary Committee was voting for Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Senate.
But Flick said he only did so by understanding that the FBI was backed by a minority Democrat to file charges against him for a nomination next week.
Flick was somewhat convinced after a conversation with his friend Chris Cowens, who is a Democratic senator.
After discussions with Cowens and several other senators, Flick made his decision.
The choice of Flick was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to start an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Political Game’ in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May said critics of the EU’s exit plan were “playing a political game” with Britain’s future and would hurt national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend the Conservative Party conference.
In an interview with the newspaper, former Secretary of State Boris Johnson spoke of his attack on the Chequers program for Brexit, suggesting that the UK and the EU should collect their “completely irrational” tariffs.
Dayton Simpson Police Arrested for Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting at the 20-year-old LSU basketball team’s Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department says 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been charged with second-degree murder and is in jail.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms had lost his glasses during the fight.
Reports from the WAFB-affiliated CBS said police found the glasses at the scene and Simpson’s DNA was on it.
After being interrogated by Simpson, police said Simpson had admitted that he had shot Wide.
According to the defense attorney, his bail is set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday that identified the cause of death as a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The department sought help from the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area who led to the arrest.
Jo Alova, director of sports affairs at LSU, thanked the lawmakers for their "consistency and pursuit of justice" in the region.
Sims was 20 years old.
The forward grew up at 1 meter and 98 centimeters in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in each game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “destroyed” and “in shock” by Wade’s death.
Wade said, “That’s what you’re always worried about.”
Volcanic mountains spread their ashes in Mexico City
The volcanic ashes of Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to come near the volcano, and recorded 183 gas and ashes eruptions in 24 hours.
The center has recorded several roars and vibrations in its systems.
Images on social media show some neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, covered a thin layer of car glass ash.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity of the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of voting anniversary for independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday during clashes with pro-independence protesters in Barcelona’s anti-rebellion police, when thousands joined the rival group’s protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s separation.
A group of separatists who were held back by the riot police began throwing eggs and spraying powder paints, causing dark clouds of dust to form on the streets, usually accompanied by crowds of tourists.
When the police used batons to surround the protesters, the conflict escalated again.
For more than a few hours, pro-independence groups had lined up with the slogan “forbidden forgetting, forbidding forgiveness” against unionists who shouted “Long live Spain.”
Local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions in the region are still high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the anniversary is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters decided to secede completely, although the number of voters was low and opponents of secession had boycotted voting.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in areas across the region.
Pro-independence groups staged a sit-in on Friday to prevent protests backed by the National Police.
The demonstrators marched, but had to choose a different path.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia’s expectations for independence would be met.
“Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I watched my parents cry because they could vote, but now we’re in a deadlock.”
Despite managing that crucial victory following last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties failed to continue their movement this year, many of their well-known leaders remain in exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and declaring independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the protests with his cell phone backed by police, said the dispute had reached a dead-end between politicians on both sides.
He said, “It’s getting more and more stressful.”
On Saturday, Orwell Janqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in temporary detention since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
He said: “The act of nominating the European Parliament is the best democratic way to condemn the repression and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government.”
LONDON: Several men were arrested after a house was demolished by a car.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car hit a house in London.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 19:30 British time in Balingrad Crescent.
Detective Bob Belming said the damage to the doorway and the building itself had occurred.
In some areas, a car was also shot.
Manga with its own goal led Livingston to win 1-0 over the Rangers.
Dali Manga's first goal for Livingston ensured the team's victory
Livingston confused the Rangers, and Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Aborex Club.
Dolly Manga's goal led Livingston to coach Gary Holt above the Hybrids.
Gerrard will not win the Premier League this season and will play with the eight-pointed Hertz team next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, coached by Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, is ramping up his invincibility to six games.
Livingston lost his chance against his guest.
Holt’s team worked aggressively before they scored, and their direct shots caused the Rangers trouble.
Scott Robinson defeated the defenders, but his efforts were in vain against the goal, after which Allen Litgoff only managed to distract his shot towards the opener to reach Craig Halkett along the goal.
The host team was happy to play against the Ranger and knew they could put the other team in trouble in some parts of the game.
And in this way they were able to strike that vital flower.
Livingston got a free kick, the ball came to the manga through the Gallacher and Robinson decks, and he entered the ball through the middle of the penalty area.
By that point, the Rangers had possession of the ball, but the host team’s defense was indistinguishable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly worked largely without error.
The process continued in the second half, although Liam Kelly managed to control the Alfredo Morelos ball.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Alan McGregor, the gatekeeper of the Rangers, and Litgoff also hit Livingston with the outside leg.
The strikes from both sides were constantly directed towards the Livingston penalty area, but they were all repelled. The Rangers team claimed a penalty twice - once after the Halkett error on the player replaced the Golden Middleton and one for touching the ball with the hand.
"Extraordinary Work" Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter from Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and result for Livingston.
In my opinion they were excellent, still better than expected on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and their teammates have changed little since returning to the top, but the main glory of Holt is that he wears it when he enters the team.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and organized the defense very well, at the same time Manga was able to defeat Conor Goldsson and Joe Veral.
However, the Rangers were not impressed.
As good as they were at Gerrard’s time, they are now far from that standard.
They didn’t have a final finisher — they only managed to open the host team’s defense once — and that’s a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Dual reception from Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
On Saturday, Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin’s blue sky with a smile.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They discussed issues related to human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s membership in the European Union.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to open a new, very large mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkish expatriates.
Police prevented 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of supporters gathered near the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of whom were Kurdish - began chanting slogans, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in the country.
The protests between the two groups indicate a rift between the two groups of German-based Turks, some of whom see Erdogan as a hero and others who insult him as an authoritarian ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a car accident
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred in the southeast of the city, at the intersection of Besswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and emergency services were on the scene, but the man died on the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after another crash on Childers Street, about a mile from the site of Saturday’s crash, which led to the death of a bicycle rider.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were investigating the matter to identify the man on the bike and inform his close relatives.
The road has been closed and the route of the buses has been changed, and drivers are advised not to cross the area.
Long Lartin Prison Officials: Six Officers Injured During Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a high-security male prison for rioting.
The riot at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire occurred at 9:30 British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Expert officers from Tornado have stepped in to deal with the chaos that engulfs eight inmates in a besieged corner.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed at HMP Long Lartin to deal with possible incidents.
Six of the workers suffered injuries that were treated.
“We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons, and it’s clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and they may spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, some of whom are among the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the jail chief was taken to the hospital after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, anti-insurgency officers were called to prison to deal with a serious upheaval, in which employees were attacked with billiard cannons.
Sudden flood threat by Hurricane Rosa in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit from rain)
It’s rare to see a reduction in tropical pressure in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, which means the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa has passed through the southwestern Sahara and will pose a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service for Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, has predicted a sudden swelling.
Rosa is expected to tilt her way to Phoenix on Tuesday and cause rain in the area by the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Service at Phoenix noted in a top-notch message that “since 1950, only ten tropical tornadoes have caused tropical storms or low-pressure conditions about 320 kilometers away from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1976) was a storm within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, up from 150 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
In other parts of the southwestern Sahara, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there is likely to be 25 to 50 mm of rain, which can reach 100 mm in total.
For areas that are far from the dangers of sudden flooding, the Rosa rains may be beneficial as these areas suffer from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely to be helpful for some areas as the southwestern region is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center and weather.com, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme drought conditions, the second-highest in intensity.
Initially, the route of Hurricane Rosa is towards Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on the brink of a hurricane, with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h on Sunday morning, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 20 mph.
The storm continues to encounter colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thus decreasing its strength.
Therefore, tropical storms are expected to show their strength in the afternoon or Monday night in Mexico.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico can be severe and the risk of flooding is significant.
According to weather.com, "total rainfall from Baja California to Northwest Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, which can reach up to 150 mm."
Rosa then moves north from Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a low-pressure tropical region, and southwards to Utah later on Tuesday after crossing Arizona.
According to the National Hurricane Center, “the main forecasted risk of Rosa and its remnants includes extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the southwestern United States desert.”
These rains are expected to cause sudden and life-threatening flooding in the desert and landslides in the mountains.
Attack in Midsummer North: Four suspects arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for assault and attempted murder.
The teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 British time while he was injured.
He was taken to a hospital where he survived in a "sustainable" condition.
According to police, Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radoosk area.
Police officers have asked people who may have recorded a video of what happened on the phone to go to the police.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Is Angry and Anger at Democratic Party
In a speech in Willing, West Virginia, Trump said: “The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the brutal rejection of the Democratic Party’s brutal tactics.
Trump says Kavanaugh was upset with the Democratic Party’s “stubbornness and anger” during his election campaign.
Ahead of a congressional hearing on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he strongly rejected Christiane Blasy Ford’s claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was adolescent decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
President Trump said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
He told a large crowd of supporters in West Virginia: “The vote to approve Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to approve one of the most famous legal professionals of our time, a lawyer with a full history in public service.”
While talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh as Kavanaugh.
“Five weeks have gone into one of the most important elections in our lives.
He said, “I’m not in the election round, but I am.”
“That’s why I’m here and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats’ mission was to create “resistance and obstruction.”
A senior GOP adviser told CNN that the first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and casualties seem to rise
Officials said Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and that large waves had taken many people off the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered to attend a festival on the coast of the city of Palo, which suddenly took a large number of waves up to six metres (18 feet) in the evening and drowned them, destroying everything on its way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Organization (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta: “Yesterday when the tsunami threat hit, people didn’t stop working on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, which is why they were victims.”
“The tsunami that came and pulled cars, carved out, and houses, and destroyed everything on the ground,” he said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h at sea before it reached the coastline.
He said some people went to the top of the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from their homes and accommodated in 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued in the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive earthquake on Friday had about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
It is said that the city’s geography, located at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have enlarged the size of a tsunami.
The group described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nogrove said the casualties and damage along the 300-kilometre-long coastline north of Palo Alto, an area called Dangala that is close to the epicenter of the earthquake, may be higher.
The group said it had “completely cut off communication and no information” about Dangalla was available.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living there and that the organization’s staff and volunteers had been dispatched to the area.
“It’s a disaster, but it could have been much worse.”
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not notifying that the tsunami was approaching Palo, but officials said the waves had reached the coast at the time the warning was issued.
In the videos shared on social media, a man's voice is heard on the top floor of a building, giving a loud warning of a tsunami approaching people on the street below the building.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach and took the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power cuts and communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Officials said the military sent aid to Jakarta and other cities by cargo planes, but homeless people still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only open to aid in relief efforts and is closed for other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo visited the settlements in Palo on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Mr. Doseba said the World Vision staff from Dongalla had declared the city of Palo secure, in which the staff had installed tent shelters in their office yards and were in the midst of the devastation.
He said: "They said that many houses have been destroyed.
It's very bad.
While relief groups have begun their move to mitigate the disaster with the help of available tools, some have complained that the deployment of high-skilled foreign aid troops to Palu is being prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, resources and manpower from abroad can only be declared a national disaster in the affected area.
But this announcement has not yet taken place.
Avalya Arrani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: “This incident is still a disaster at the provincial level.”
“When the government accepts it, it can be declared a national disaster. In that case, the path to international aid is open, but such a situation does not yet exist.”
Despite two nights of the earthquake and the Friday tsunami in Palo Alto, the families and friends of those missing continue to hope for a miracle to happen to their loved ones and change the story of this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was trapped under the rubble and spent two days with her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paraglider coach Gandon Sobandu has been coached by two Paraglider athletes who were trained for the Asian Games. The tournament ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other people who were trapped in the Rua Hotel included Mr. Mandagi and his students.
“As a senior paraglider coach, I’m under a lot of emotional pressure.”
Mr. Gandon explained that a few hours after the news of Rua Rua’s demolition, he was worried about his students and sent messages to competitors at the Palo Beach Festival via WhatsApp.
However, his messages received only a gray tick instead of a pair of blue ticks.
“I think the grey tick means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they transferred money to a Newport ATM in Levee
According to news published by the Newport Police Center, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink employees on Friday morning when the money was transferred to an ATM in Newport, Levee.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said the driver was ejecting an ATM and preparing to pay for it at an entertainment center.
While he was busy, another man ran “from behind the Brink employee” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to reports, witnesses have identified several suspects who fled the scene, but police have not identified the number of people involved in the incident.
People who have information about identity theft should contact the Newport Police on 36802-892-859.
Kenny West: The rapper who changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kenny West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote, “My official name is Kenny West.”
The 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye and used the nickname for his eighth album, which will be released in June.
The name change was announced before he appeared on Saturday night's live show, where he announced that he would soon be making his new album, Yandhi.
The producer said he replaced the former singer Ariana Grande, who had cancelled the show for "emotional reasons."
Ye is an acronym for the current professional name of West, and he said the word was of religious significance to him.
Earlier this year, West said in an interview with Big Boy’s radio show about his album, “I believe you are the word most used in the Bible to mean you.
“I will be you, and you will be me, and I will be you.
I will change your name to Ye to reflect our good, our evil, our confusion and everything else.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the few famous rap singers who has changed his name.
For example, Sean Combs is known by different names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he was more willing to call himself Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-worker, JAY-Z is also known as with or without blurred lines and letters, large or small.
AMLO has promised not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as he approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
López Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Palace on Saturday that he would “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
During the peaceful protests that took place on October 2, 1968, and as student movements of the left were growing across Latin America, soldiers opened fire on the people, killing 300 people.
López Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening public universities.
Unemployment and a lack of education opportunities lead to young people being drawn to gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its artificial intelligence (AI) funding.
Kai Fu Li, an AI investor and activist working at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said: "Given that China has become more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this area.
The comments came after various departments of the U.S. government issued statements on AI, and that the U.S. generally lacked an official strategy on AI.
While China announced its plan last year, its goal is to be at the top of AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling AI research funding would be a good start, given that other countries are farther away from the United States and we are looking forward to the next development in AI,” Lee said.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling the investment could double the chances of successful AI in the future.
Li is the author of “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the Othello Hero in the United States.
Lee praises technology competitions held under the previous U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, conducted by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, and calls for things like this in the future to help identify future dreams.
Lee says researchers in the U.S. often work hard to get government assistance.
Li said, “It’s not China that makes university researchers, it’s the companies that do it.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired academics to work on AI.
Lee said a change in immigration policies could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of AI.
He says I think people with a PhD in AI should automatically be given a green card.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development program.
According to Li, China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals at academic institutions, which is similar to what the National Science Foundation and other government agencies do for U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a joint AI center, which aims to create a partnership between industry and university, and the White House announced the formation of an AI selection committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a plan called AI Next.
And in the case of NSF, it has already invested more than $100 million in AI research.
But U.S. law, which sought to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not done much in recent months.
Macedonians have announced in a referendum that they want to change their country’s name.
Macedonians will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that will resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has prevented the country from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor’s name represents some sort of claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Slavic Macedonians.
President George Ivanoff has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the referendum raises doubts as to whether the number of voters needed to be at least 50 percent valid.
The question on the ballot is, “Do you agree with the agreement with Greece and with NATO and with the EU?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zerman Zayev, believe the cost should be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to be able to enter the EU and NATO.
Olivera Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje, said: “I came here today to vote for the future of my country, for the sake of the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because our lives will all be safer.”
Members of parliament have said they will stick to the outcome of the election, although this is not legally necessary.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority.
The provincial election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, the number of voters did not exceed 16 percent, while in the last parliamentary election in 2016, about 66 percent of registered voters voted.
Josie Tanovsky, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje, said: “I voted for my children, our place is Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorka and son Dashko cast their vote in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, to open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small platform and sets up chairs in front of tents set up by referendum-sanctioned people.
“We belong to NATO and the European Union, but we want to join them proudly, not through the back door.”
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
“If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go back to others like China and Russia and be part of the integrated community of Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zarif says NATO membership is a huge investment for a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
Zapf said: “I believe that the majority of the people are in favor of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO.”
He said, “Yes, it will be a confirmation of our future.”
A poll released by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday found that between 30 and 43 percent of the conditional voters would participate in the referendum — a lower percentage than the quota.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Thelma showed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be successful, a 50% plus one vote is required.
The failure of a referendum is the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is past Brighton and scores the ball.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling clashed with Brighton on Monday at Manchester United to win the game 2-0.
In the 65th minute, Aguero brought the ball to the gate.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle line at the start of the resumption.
He quickly passed through the three defenders of Brighton and opened up space for himself.
Then Agüero found himself surrounded by four green players.
He pulled the defense around with his moves on the edge of the penalty area.
Then he turned to the left, and turned to the right.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero with a blow inside the pitch, and with his right foot he struck the ball, defeating the goalkeeper Matthew Ryan Brighton and hitting the ball to the right wall of the gate.
City team manager Pep Guardiola told reporters: “Aguero is dealing with certain problems in his legs.”
“We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at the same time.”
But it was Sterling who first scored in this Premier League match for the sky blues.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the ball deep in the ground.
He brought the ball beautifully from the left side to Lori-sin.
Before Sterling moved to a farther arrow, Sean hit the ball several times.
The blue skies of the forefront, right at the opening of the gate, clasped the ball in a net.
The City of the Champions League group games will take place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler against the Rockies
While the Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, they don’t have much reason to try again.
But the team always hopes to win against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it has the concept of a playoff for the Rockies, which is a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Region National League.
The Rockies won at least one Wild Card on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still plan to win the first title.
“While we play for nothing, we can at least touch the ball, knowing what it’s like here in Denver with so many people, and the other team will probably play at the highest level we’ve ever faced.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in the competition?”
The Nationals team should announce a starter for Sunday’s game, but it’s reported they’re willing to put Scherzer in the post.
Scherzer, who could have his 34th start, has a throw training session on Thursday and a regular rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player figures are: 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 in 220 2.3 this season.
Trump speeches in West Virginia
President Trump has implicitly spoken about the situation surrounding the Supreme Court and Brett Cavano, as well as the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We’re going to gamble on all of our achievements in November.
Five weeks have gone into one of the most important elections in our lives.
“This election is one of the biggest and it’s big – I’m not in this election, but I am, in fact, because I’m here to fight for the candidates.”
Trump continued, “You see this horrible group, this horrible radical Democrats, these things are happening right now.
They are determined to use whatever means they need to gain power, and you see the depravity of these and the filth of this group.
They don’t care who gets hurt in this campaign, who they’re taking away to gain power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we don’t want to give them the two.”
He said the Democrats’ mission is “to create resistance and obstruction.”
He said, "And you can see how much they have treated the Democrats in the last four days as angry, dishonest, dirty and wrong."
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein’s comments on how the audience had cheered him up.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you read the documents leaked out?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
“No, no, I wait—the body language that was really bad—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
For those who advocate freedom of expression, this is unacceptable.
I was not surprised when Momentum activists in the local party voted for me.
After all, I was the last in the line of representatives of the Labour Party who did not welcome it – all for freedom of expression.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan had seen the same behavior, because she is firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of a policy toward the economy, national security, for Europe, there are similar issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Labour Party’s meeting in Nottingham East on Friday announced that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, the Friday night GC meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, this tone is not seen in many meetings today, and the promise of a “friendly and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it had been started.
It is seen very often that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and opinions are judged on whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
The phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when I previously thought I would share a similar political theory with his colleagues, they thought I was going to turn them around, and they had positions about national security or the single EU market that I never agreed with.
Whenever I speak in public — and it really doesn’t matter what I say — it’s an intense speech about the abuse of social media that calls for non-election, condemning the policy of the center, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it didn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues because the opinions they give about me are political.
I am exposed to the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexual abuse or racism every day but are not ashamed at all.
One of the disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that abuse has become normal to a certain level.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance for other words.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church, and with every move caused by “distrust” or a change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years that makes me look down, have nothing to say, and just say okay.
But that’s not what I went into politics to do.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolteacher, which was inspired by the Thatcher government, and this led me to officially miss high school classes, so I was trying to provide better public service to those who needed it — no matter whether I was a council member or a minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is confused about the political positions and bases of conflict I have with my current leadership.
To those who encouraged this move on Friday, I can only say that when the country is working hard towards a Brexit that is hurting our households, our businesses and our public services, I am not willing to waste time and energy on the loyalty of the Labour Party leader.
But really, one of my messages to the members of the House, whether Labour or not, is this: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of disqualification or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is in your best interest.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr Invincible
The effort in the last two stages may change the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Air deserved this fantastic and interesting win in the Rugby League.
They are currently at the top of the table and the only team that hasn’t lost on one side yet.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense, and the odds were stacked that they could win the host team and coach Peter Murcie was right to be satisfied.
“We were tested during the tournament and we haven’t lost yet, so we should be happy.”
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Well, Ir, they used their chance better than us.”
Grant Anderson's effort in the 14th minute was completed by Frisier Clemou and Iyer, but a yellow card was given to Captain Scotland, Rory Hughes, for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggott did not take an effort without a pass.
Klimo drew the forward Ayer with a penalty kick, before that, right in the middle of the game, scoring a goal after that with a solo pass, giving Ayer a score of 17 to 5.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's effort reduced the difference to five points with Bagot's passing.
After a severe injury, Ruaridh Knott, the game was halted for a long time, after re-starting, through the effort of Stafford McDowell, by Clemo Pass, Aero extended the distance again.
Then Blair McPherson took the yellow card, and Melrose lost another player at the end of Bruce Collin’s effort.
However, the host team returned to the game, and when Stroann Hutchinson took the yellow card off the ball, McPherson was behind the attacking group Ir Touch Down.
Clemou gave a quick pass, as he had done in the beginning, after Kyle Row shot David Armstrong inside the premises and drove the attacking player Gregor Henry away from the fifth zone.
The star of Still Game is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry.
It appears that after it was revealed that actor Ford Kayran is still managing a licensed restaurant in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old played the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC’s popular series, which he also wrote, and worked with Greg Humphrey for a long time as a comedy couple.
The two have announced that the next series, the ninth of the series, will be the last of the series, and Kirnan appears to be planning his life after Craigalong.
According to the official registration lists, he will be the director of Edriftmore with limited liability.
The actor declined to comment, though Scottish Sun said Cairnn was looking to enter the “progressive restaurant” business in Glasgow.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific.
Sailors guard the naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the blue ocean flag is hovering.
On naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the slogan reads: “The sea is our right.
“Returning it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the loss of the coastline and its delivery to Chile that led to a bloody war in the 19th century remains alive—like a passion for sailing in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of courtship.
Bolivia’s diplomat, Roberto Calzadilla, said: “Bolivia is moving, the spirit of unity and peace prevails and, of course, awaits positive results.”
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the ICJ’s announcement on the big screen, hoping that the Hague court — after decades of negotiations — will vote in favor of Bolivia’s claim and force Chile to sit at the negotiating table on Bolivia’s dominance and access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic and indigenous president, Evo Morales, who is fighting hard to be re-elected next year, is bragging about Monday’s verdict.
At the end of August, he promised that “we will be back in the Pacific very soon.”
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and it will be accompanied by a slight change if it does.
The United Nations court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant a part of Chile’s territory, saying the court’s ruling cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations.
International law expert in Chile, Paz Zarate, said the ICJ court’s ruling came only six months after the arguments were heard, indicating that the case was “not complicated.”
And far from Bolivia’s extra conflicts, the last four years may have brought it back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been exploited by the current government of Bolivia,” Zárate said.
He believes Morales’ adventurous rhetoric has diminished Chile’s goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to debate at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to continue.
The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other’s country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wells, Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision would have an unusual speed.
Bolivia will have a “great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” on Monday, he said, and an opportunity to end the 139-year conflict over mutual interests.
Calzadilla also made it clear that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – would use the maritime issue as a political leverage in his favor.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.”
“This verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says denuclearization will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ray Yong-ho, has said that as long as the country can’t trust Washington, it will never destroy its nuclear weapons.
Ray was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during the two-nation summit in Singapore.
The remarks point to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be soon resuming stalemate talks, which were held in Singapore over three months ago with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on nuclear diplomacy.
Ray says that the continued U.S. sanctions and protests to declare an end to the Korean War would make North Korea kneel down as an "unrealistic dream".
Washington will act very cautiously until Pyongyang makes a serious move towards disarmament.
President Trump and Kim both called for a second meeting.
But whether Pyongyang is serious about eliminating nuclear arsenals, which is likely to be the only way to guarantee the country’s security, there is widespread skepticism.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion showcases the latest line of very large hats on the High Street route near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or avoid the sun completely, you don’t have to search too much.
Valentino and Tom Brown, who are fashion designers, presented a series of very large hats for the SS19 series that mesmerized the design style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats filled Instagram in the summer, and designers showcased their eye-catching creations at the costume show.
The design worn by Valentino was a beige hat on the head, decorated with a wide-brimmed edge that covered the head of the model's ladies.
Other items that were too big included watermelon decorated, a witch’s hat, and even a pineapple, but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showcased a collection of bizarre masks that were only used during Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks covered the lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than of the costume design.
One of the designs was similar to a diving cap with a breathable tube and a swim glass, and the other was like a watered-down ice cream.
And if you can wear these weird hats and everyone looks at you, then luck is on your side.
Style observers predict that these large hats will be able to open their way to street stores near you.
Out-sized hats at La Bomba's heel, a 60-cm-width-wide hat that can be seen on the heads of people like Rihanna to Emily Rajakowski.
The school of thought labeled behind the highly unusable hats that were circulating across social media posted a great creation of the location - a beach sack of mattress that is almost the size of the Mayo swim model that carries it.
The burnt orange mattress sack with a white leather handle was the original design for the Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “These big hats and beach bags are expected to be available next summer at street stores – as the designer has made such a huge impact, the demand for large accessories cannot be ignored.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens in the global arena
Scotland’s independent schools are at a high academic level and continued in 2018 with excellent results in the exams, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social affairs of the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best service to students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for graduate and higher education, their elective careers and their place as citizens in the global arena.
As an educational department that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he will speak to you.”
If you speak to him in his own language, it will enter his heart.”
It’s an important point to note that to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can’t rely solely on English.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that foreign language lessons are at the top of the league table with the highest acceptance rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who study in foreign languages achieved an A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS-member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin Chinese obtained a higher grade A, 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish received a higher grade A.
These statistics show that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as a vital skill for children and adolescents that they will undoubtedly need in the future.
Foreign languages are now taken seriously and taught as a lesson, in the same proportion as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) lessons in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers’ hiring needs were related to language skills shortages in the collection.
Thus, the importance of language skills is becoming more and more important in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the future careers that require language, we can see how much these skills are needed in the global arena.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he can use for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners automatically puts the multilingual person ahead of the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of people do not have the ability to speak a foreign language and French is the only two-digit language with 15% of the population speaking it.
This is why investing in language education is important for children today.
Knowing different languages, especially the languages of developing countries, increases children’s chances of finding a suitable job.
Within Scotland, different schools teach different languages.
A number of schools focus on modern classical languages, while others teach languages that will be more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
It doesn’t matter what language your child is interested in, there are several languages to choose from in schools, and teaching staff who specialize in this field are available.
Scotland’s independent schools are moving towards providing a learning environment to prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today’s global business environment, the vital importance of foreign languages cannot be denied in the future of the country, so it must be included in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools continue to offer Scottish children the right to choose, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done (in French).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play for the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Expectations are running high for fans who want to see LeBron James on the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the season on Saturday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it’s not clear how many minutes he’s going to play.
Walton said on Tim Lakers’ official website: “It’s going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes.
Mike Trudel, a reporter for Lakers, says James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked to come up with plans for the first six games of the season.
He said: "I don't need to play in the first half of my career to get ready.
Trump’s election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Trump will begin a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned gatherings next week, including a halt in the politically-confident areas of Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to endorse the man’s bid to fill the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, Trump plans to draw support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in November.
When is Trump’s election rally tonight in West Virginia, and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight at ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump campaign rally in West Virginia online in the following section via YouTube Live Streaming.
Trump is likely to point to this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was dragged into controversy over allegations of her sexual misconduct and adjourned by a Senate confirmation vote for a week to investigate the FBI.
But the main purpose of this series of election rallies is to help Republicans and strengthen them in the November election.
So, according to Reuters, a spokesman for President Trump’s campaign said the five campaign rallies will be held next week with the goal of “energizing volunteers and supporters because Republicans want to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
A Trump campaign spokeswoman, who declined to be named, told Reuters: “Control of Congress is so important in the president’s agenda that he will travel to as many states as possible because we’re entering a busy campaign season.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s election rally scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could bring supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania together and be covered by the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the same state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican nominee for the Senate, Mr. Patrick Morrissey, who lags behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Heater, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said: “It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has been forced to come here to help him improve his position in the polls.”
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates their determination to fight and keep hopes alive to enter Sunday’s solo tournament
After three one-sided seasons, four-person golf games on Saturday evening could be what the Ryder Cup needs.
Motion pendulum swings are a completely innovative sport concept, but players really believe in it, and in rivalries like this, there has never been more.
So they say, where is the movement now?
“They had six points and now they’re four, so I think we’re doing it with a little bit of movement.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and 12 more games ahead.
Yet Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they’re starting to move and have a lot of things to be encouraged, especially on the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing with each other all day, each taking three out of four points.
Spieth’s movements from T to Green are excellent and a role model for everyone else.
As his turn continued, cheerful screams grew louder, he was able to throw a vital leg into the pit and double the race to a four-pointer when he and Thomas were two points behind.
His leg, which won the race for them at 15, came with a similar shout, a kind of shout that told you he believed the American team would not be eliminated.
Spieth said, “You really have to work hard and worry about your own race.”
That's all the players have left.
18 holes to do something wonderful.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the legends of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but admirable European couple scored four out of four possible points and offered a perfect job.
Mollywood was the only couple who not only didn’t shoot a boogie on Saturday evening, but also on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and even Friday morning at nine squares.
The round and manner in which their energy is exchanged with this happy and energetic crowd clearly shows that they are the players who can win on Sunday, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there will be no other famous player other than Fleetwood and Molinari to ensure a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different cavities.
However, it is still too early to talk about the greatness of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly completed the work of Sergio Garcia, who was next to Alex Noren, the champion of the morning quarterfinals.
A Boogie and a Double in the first nine squares threw the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
However, there is no one on Sunday to help you get out of your hole.
Watching four-man and four-ball matches closely is fascinating because of the interactions between the pairs of players, the advice they give and don't give, and the way in which a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has performed better as a team and has entered the final day with a significant advantage, but this season of the four-man game has shown that the United States team has also had the courage to fight, something that some people, especially Americans, were hesitant about.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe is leading 10-6.
After a very good performance in Saturday’s four-man and four-ball competition, Europe was able to beat the United States 10-6 to make a good finish on the final day.
The wonderful couple of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were able to win two victories against Tiger Woods, who worked hard to inspire others and bring their score at Le Golf National to four so far.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team, who wanted to retain the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, was able to beat an American player who had a bad throw and score 3-1 in the morning ball game.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the four-man tournament and won two matches, but they were unable to compensate for their backwardness.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points from 12 Sunday singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari doubled “Mollywood” after a thrilling weekend and are the second couple in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four-Ball Tournament, they overcame Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a more resolute 4&5 result.
Woods, who had barely won two races on Saturday, occasionally showed his talent but lost 19 of his 29 races in four-man, four-ball and seven-seat matches.
Justin Rose rested in the morning four-ball tournament and returned for the four-man tournament with his partner Henrik Stenson, and they managed to win 1&2 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the world’s first and third-place finishers.
The Europeans, however, did not make their way on a delightful, well-ventilated day in the southwest of Paris.
The big three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a good example for Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 1&2 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to the field, losing the first two holes, winning 3&4 over Poulter and Rory McIlroy.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team can make up four points and enter the individual tournament, although the Furyk team only needs an equaliser to maintain the cup.
However, after being second in two days, it seems like Sunday’s counter-attack encounter has been too difficult for them.
North Korea Says Without Trust There Is No Way To Disarm One-Way
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions has caused more distrust in the United States and under such circumstances, he would not be willing to give up his nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the International Atomic Energy Agency’s annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps to show goodwill” over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the site, and committing to the non-development of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we have not received any appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not act first and unilaterally towards our disarmament.”
While Ri reiterates North Korea’s repeated dissatisfaction with Washington’s resistance to the “stage” approach to denuclearization that North Korea will reward with every step taken, his statement is significant because Pyongyang, unlike in the past, does not completely rule out the possibility of one-sided denuclearization.
Ri points to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first official meeting between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim has pledged to try to “dismantle the Korean peninsula” and Trump has promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tough international sanctions against North Korea.
Ri said: “The United States insists on a “primarily nuclear disarmament” approach, intends to achieve its goal by using coercion by increasing sanctions pressure, and even opposes a “declaration of an end to the war.”
Some fools think that sanctions can put us on our knees, that’s a fantasy.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plan for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which US President Donald Trump had said at the United Nations a few days earlier this week.
Instead, he referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding that “if the other side were to address the issue of denuclearization, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been caught in such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s speech was completely different from last year’s, he told the UN General Assembly last year after Mr. Trump called Kim a “missile man” who is committing suicide, targeting U.S. soil with North Korea’s missiles is inevitable.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in moving toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmament.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no timeframe to do so, stressing that “if it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the UN Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously, without undue delay, until we are sure that the denuclearization is fully, finalized and verified.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, after which he said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of "gangster demands" after only a few hours.
North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate action".
He said Kim had told him that he was referring to “proportionate measures” security assurances that Trump had pledged in Singapore and that he wanted to move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning about rest.
A new Harvard lesson this year, in an effort to combat the spread of Machu Picchu’s culture in the study among the “living nights” of high-caffeination students, calls for more sleep for all undergraduates.
One university professor found that most of the world’s best university students are unaware of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an active specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
After a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he decided to launch the course.
He told the Telegraph: “At the end of the day, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why have I been told this now and in my final year?’
He said no one had ever told me about the importance of sleep — which surprised me.”
The unit, which was first introduced in the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improve public health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the University’s Health Services, said the university had decided to add the lesson to the curriculum after finding that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
This one-hour lesson consists of a series of interactive activities.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books, and information about the effects of caffeine, light, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of getting used to sleeping on time.
On the other hand, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
Professor Czeisler added: “We know that this lesson will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health.”
He said a culture of “living the night” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students show that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to deal with stress, fatigue, and anxiety—even preventing overweight, she said, because lack of sleep leads the brain to a state of hunger that makes a person constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology who attended a professor’s class at Harvard last year in his first year, helped design the course.
She said the lesson opened her eyes and inspired her to try to deliver it across the campus.
He expressed hope that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to take a similar course before joining the competitive institute.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to determine when they should go to bed as well as when they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lighting systems, which can make your circadian rhythm out of balance and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal Defeated by Gerrard's Companions
The Dolly Menga hit gave in to the distraught Steven Gerrard and caused the Blue-tapped Rangers team to suffer a 0-1 defeat in a match outside their home in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking to register their first win after winning 1-4 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt scored Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach to keep their team with eight points of difference in Ladbrokes Premiership's chase.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers, with little motivation, were never able to do as well as they needed to draw the game.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston finished third and is only behind Hibernian due to the difference in goals.
One of the Rangers players, Calum Spence, was injured by an object that appeared to have been thrown from the corner of the stadium and had to be treated for a head injury, which could be a problem for them.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that led Ayr past the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, went on the field with the same 11 previous Livingston players who scored a Hearts goal last week, and he should have been happy that his team was ready to beat their rivals every time.
The Rangers may have more possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of the balls he had.
They had to score just two minutes after arriving when Menga sent the ball to Scott Pittman with his first deep pass on the Allan McGregor gate, but the midfielder missed the big opportunity and sent the ball out with a long distance.
A remote free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-mate Alan Lithgow was able to only send him behind the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but in the case of the game they played in the last third, there seemed to be more than faith, there was hope.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that a penalty should be announced in the final 15 minutes when he hit Steven Lawless, but the Colombian referee Steven Thomson did not pay heed to the requests of the Colombian player.
The Rangers scored only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit the Lassana Coulibaly head and Ovie Ejaria hit a little bit.
While the 34-minute goal by the Livingston team may have been against the flow of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it.
Again, Rangers couldn’t keep up with Jacobs’ plans.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, and he calmly brought the ball to Menga, and he also easily hit the final blow and opened the gate.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent in the middle of the two halves, and this change showed its almost immediate impact when the attacker intended to take the ball to Morelos, but Kelly came out of the gate with a beautiful move and prevented it from reaching.
But Livingston continued to deliver exactly the same beautiful game that the audience liked, with Lithgow and Halkett repelling the long balls one after the other.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up well against Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton claimed in the final moments that when he hit Jacobs, a penalty had to be announced, but Thomson did not listen to him again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our “Sunday Morning” annuity: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
With Geiger’s performance in the 1950 film Coronado Bells, with artists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, scientists who didn’t seem to be cowboys, Geiger’s Counter, which was once one of the cornerstones of science, also became one of the cornerstones of public culture:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “The Geiger calculator is used to track radioactive minerals such as uranium.
“When you put this phone on the meat, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: “Really, it’s going to explode now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, named after him, is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see “patient” cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see and kill "patient" cells.
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify patient cells as part of treatment.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then "see" the protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject.
The experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to identify “patient” cells, was treated and observed that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can “see” the common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 "develops several types of cancer" including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from the patient’s body and “training” them to how cancer cells are targeted has been successfully used in the treatment of a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West wore a MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio after he praised US President Donald Trump in his performance on Saturday Night Live and said he would be elected in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, Ghost Town, which wore a cap with the slogan “Make America Great,” made unrelated remarks against Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“There have been times when I talk to white people and they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have gone to America a long time ago.”
SNL began the show with a satirical performance by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star emulated the satirical testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the episode didn’t air, West’s commentary was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It’s unclear if Rock intended to ridicule West.
West also told the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
According to the Washington Examiner, he said, “They bullied me behind the scenes.
He said, “Don’t wear that hat.”
They bullied me!
And then they told me that you were in a slump.”
West went on, “You want to see the shrinking space?” And then he said, “You have to wear my Superman shirt, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try the love.”
Veriety reported that his conversations caused at least two Huo audiences, and the SNL broadcasting staff seemed to be panicked, and someone there told them: “The entire studio has been silenced by a deadly silence.”
Last minute, OWEST was brought to the show as a replacement for American singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, a rapper, died a few days ago.
West surprised a lot of people by playing the song I Love It and while her dress was like a Perrier bottle.
West supported the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, tweeting: “To one of the most courageous people: Thank you for resisting MOB.”
But host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West “represents what he really believes, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I prefer not to support someone I think is adopting and spreading a mindset that I think is detrimental to my community (by buying music or clothing or supporting ‘art’).
He added: "He's free.
And so are we.”
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "a person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name to Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper co-star Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion, changed his name to a symbol and then became an artist, formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at Belfast restaurant
After a man was stabbed to death at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday, a 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington star of Game of Thrones has been criticized for toxic masculinity syndrome
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, a skilled swordsman in HBO’s brutal, fantasy and medieval Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been criticized for having the stereotype of Machu’s hero, and it is said that playing such roles often makes young boys feel that they need to be violent and tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "there was a problem" and was asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who is recently married to a supporting star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admits that she feels “absolutely empowered” about solving the issue.
“Right now, I personally feel quite empowered – where did we go wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What have we taught men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how should we change this?
It’s obvious that one thing is wrong with young men.”
He also said in the interview that when Game of Thrones ends next summer, he does not intend to make a comeback or continue the series, saying that “his work with the battlefield and the horses is over.”
From November, Kit plays in True West remake of Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best outcome of the Game of Thrones series was to meet his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my family and my future life from here on out.”
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have the disease in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease is transmitted through sex, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to injections and infected blood transfusions.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province, but the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is very common.
Research estimates that due to the country’s conservative values, 90-70% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease occur due to insufficient sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies involvement in GOP senators
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that one of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and websites of the far-right party.
In a statement posted on Twitter, Waters said: “False, false and repetitive lies.”
According to reports, the data included the home address and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from Southern California and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information sent on the Internet on Thursday was sent by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during one of the Senate sessions on allegations of sexual misconduct raised against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of these posts was linked to the Waters office and released information from one of the Waters staff.
Waters continued, “This baseless claim is absolutely false and absolutely false.”
“My employee – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false claims – has in no way been responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: “This was a lie associated with anger.”
“This shows that he does not have the right spirit to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not get angry.
He shouldn’t be spending hard.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
It should be quiet and peaceful.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared to be very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, one of the Republican candidates who was going to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
He tweeted, “If it’s true, it’s a big claim.”
Waters said in a statement that its office had warned “relevant legal authorities and entities” against these false claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and that they take legal responsibility for all the destructive and dangerous actions they have taken against one or all of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson’s Weak and Anti-Spy
Recently it has become commonplace that we see signs of Brexit in every new film that relates to the UK, and this seems to be the case with the new version of the action-comedy Johnny English film – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is making a humorous film about how low we really are going to be a new export opportunity for people?
By the way, Johnny English’s big-eyed, rubber-faced and incompetent has been able to get a license and launch a new version for the second time — which his name more than anything else indicates he’s a funny comedy character designed for non-English-speaking cinematic areas.
Of course, he’s an idiot who, despite his strange pretense of greasy language, blends a little bit of detective Clouseau’s character, Mr. Bean’s character, and some of the man’s character into the movie Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the mysterious Atkinson traveler and international man, who once appeared on the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials and left the scene after the chaos erupted.
In the latest version of JE, there are only one or two beautiful scenes.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches the helicopter with medieval armor worn and its blades briefly hit his hat.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is on the stage, but it feels like its humor is too weak and oddly overrated, especially given that “serious” brand films like 007 and their own impossible mission are now confidently presenting comedy as a part of the film.
It feels like the humor of this film is more for children than for adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English’s humorous events are less focused than Atkinson’s stunts in his silent film Bean.
This time the film’s thematic hypothesis is that Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret network of British spies and uncovered the identity of all British spies out of fear that they are serving – a small, regrettable role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last blow to a prime minister, an important face under pressure, and has already lost its grip because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson performs best in a role similar to Theresa-May, but there’s nothing more in the script that can be exploited.
His intelligence advisers inform him that since all active spies have been compromised, he must re-employ one of the retirees.
And that means the same Johnny English, while now working as a teacher at a modern educational institution, is offering secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are a few beautiful stunts here and on the scenes where English is teaching at the Spy Academy.
English is quickly brought back to Whitehall and presents in a brief brief briefing, then joins Bough’s former colleague, who had a lot of problems with each other, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married and transferred to a submarine commander, a high-class female character played by Vicki Pepperdine but failed to do well.
So Batman and Robin, who were horribly mistaken about everything in Her Majesty’s Secret Service, returned to the scene and sat next to Olga Kurylenko, who plays the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by the tech billionaire who has a charismatic personality, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the negative role played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bough start their own satirical odyssey: as waitress, they lead to the fire of a luxurious French restaurant; they lead to beatings by hiding their smugglers in a luxury Volta boat and leaving the country; and English in an attempt to use virtual reality headsets to familiarize themselves with the interiors of Volta’s home, causing a lot of chaos.
Sure, all efforts have been made for the final scene, but while it’s enjoyable and at the same time action-packed, the effects of children’s special films are also seen throughout the film.
Something quite average.
And like the rest of Johnny English, I couldn’t find an answer to my question: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party rejected the idea that it was designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is planning a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week – but get paid as much as five days a week.
According to reports, the party is calling on corporate leaders to give employees an extra day of paid leave, using the savings generated by the AI revolution.
The plan will allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend – and continue to receive the same pay as before.
Sources say the idea is “suitable” to the party’s economic plan and that the party is trying to move the country towards the interests of workers.
The move to a four-day working week has been approved by the Trade Unions Congress as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected before the end of the year.
“This won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week plan is a demand that fits the party’s approach to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, but the Greens in their 2017 campaign pledged to implement a four-day week plan.
However, this demand is not currently generally accepted by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The party does not have a four-day working week and the party does not have a plan for it.”
In the shadows, Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to explain his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he had decided to take back power in public service companies from “anonymous” and “user” managers.
The Chancellor’s schemes in the shadows also mean that shareholders of water companies can’t take all their shares because the Labour government can deduct “extortions” from them based on their violations.
He also confirmed that he plans to bring workers to the board of directors of companies and create group-owned funds to transfer 10% of private-sector companies’ capital to employees, which means a maximum annual turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh has changed their mind.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI’s findings could force any of the Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
Reporter Scott Pelley, in an interview broadcast on Sunday, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI’s findings could change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open-minded than his Southern California colleague.
Kennedy said, “I think, of course.”
“As I said, I went to court, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened and the claim spread, I called him, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined and confident.”
However, Graham’s opinion seemed unchanged.
“I have expressed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh, and such accusations cannot change that.”
Referring to Christine Blasey Ford, Graham added: “Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently rejected it.”
“And anyone who calls him by his name cannot confirm the matter.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change my mind.”
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizenship Festival, an annual music event where a very famous group of stars performs and has a very important mission: to end global poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival, which is now in its seventh year, has drawn tens of thousands of people to Central Park to not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the main goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, launched in 2012, is one of the developed segments of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people working in the fight against poverty.
People who wish to attend the concert (unless they’re willing to pay for VIP tickets) should help raise awareness about their goal by performing a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, making a call, or any other effective way to end poverty.
But how successful has global citizenship been, while it takes 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to persuade them to make a call for an action request or another kind of so-called “clicktivism” – people who sign an online scrolling or posting a tweet feel like they’ve done a great job.
Global citizenship says that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded by its supporters, who have worked hard to achieve different goals.
They say these actions have helped drive global leaders to take on commitments and policies that cost more than $37 billion to make a positive impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group noted 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from their actions that at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised in aid.
The group estimates that the funds so far have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a group of UK-based investors and executives who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizenship, have pledged to “help children grow and reach their full potential” and pledged $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the region.
Ambassador Tracey Ullman said during a live concert in April 2018: “With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can eradicate malnutrition, which is a social injustice, and we can connect to history.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 requests from the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced that it will allocate the necessary funds for a project called Nutrition Power, which will include food intervention for five million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”
He said: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we’ll land and we won’t succeed.
But like the civil rights movements and the anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists to perform at this year’s event in New York hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Can Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russia’s Energy Exports - Interior Minister
U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to its navy to prevent Russia’s energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially as his activity is at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade for their energy, just like they do in the eastern and southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to this position, there are methods and tools to deal with it.
“The United States, using its navy, has the ability to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not going to the market,” he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “Energy Consumer Voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to confronting Russia and Iran, saying they were practically the same.
While referring to Russia as a “single-product country” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy, he said “the economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to influence and replace fuels.”
The statements suggest that Trump’s policy is aimed at boosting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replacing it with European gas, a cheaper but far-reaching option for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that, Trump said, would “slave” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline and reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September, “I think we have a common view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The U.S. position prompted a strong reaction from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has advised the United States to avoid interfering in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: “It is not digestible for me that a third government interferes in our energy supply.”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously” run for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “seriously” participate in the race for the midterm presidential election.
Warren confirmed at a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was looking to participate in the competition.
According to The Hill, she said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top.
“After November 6, I will be seriously looking to run for president.”
Warren, at a municipal meeting, opposed Donald Trump, saying he was “going this area in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.”
Warren has so far been categorically critical of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted on Friday, “Before the vote, we need an FBI investigation.”
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters were reluctant to vote for him in the 2020 election.
A survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center found that 58% of Massachusetts’ “probability” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of his constituents supported him in the election.
The survey found that people were more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick’s company, with 38 percent in favor of the company and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic figures who are likely to run in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said it would announce its decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions her son's PTSD syndrome at Donald Trump's election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being nominated for the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence.
Trump’s mother said at an election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, “What’s going to happen to my son, what’s going to happen to him when he comes back, I can name other families who feel the negative effects of PTSD and some of the damage our soldiers have come back with.”
Palin talked about his son’s arrest, “the big problem that everyone ignores,” and said of his son and other veterans, “they come back with a different attitude, they come back with hard hearts, they come back and ask if there is that respect for what their soldiers and air force friends and every other member of the military have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman due to the presence of reports of domestic violence and possession of guns in drunken condition.
18 states, as well as the D.C., are supporting the challenge of a new refugee policy.
Eighteen states, along with the District of Columbia, support the creation of a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that prevents asylum-seekers from fleeing criminal groups or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the Washington Department of Justice on Friday provided brief advisory information to the court challenging the refugee policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against federal policy, has not yet been determined.
He said his fiancée had abused him along with “his friend’s sons who are part of the violent gang,” but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state attorney who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from where many asylum applications are sent to the United States, are countries that face pervasive problems related to criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy has led to the cancellation of the Immigration Appeals Board, which would allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General of Colombia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored dozens of state, federal and international law."
In the brief advisory information he provided, he said: “Under federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of accurate facts and conditions, and such exceptions violate this principle.”
Lawyers also argued in the advisory information provided, considering that there was a high likelihood that immigrants would become entrepreneurs and “make the necessary work force” and concluded that the policy that prevented immigrants from entering would harm the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence by criminal groups.
In its June 11 announcement, Sessions said: “Asylum is available to those who have left their country for torture or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in certain social groups or political views.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems -- not even the serious ones -- that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Despite the doubling of the number of casualties, efforts are underway to find survivors in Palu.
The conditions for survivors were increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said she felt “very bad” when she touched her febrile baby’s body at a evacuation center in the affected city of Palu.
“An ambulance brings the bodies every moment.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, wandering amongst their belongings submerged in water, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals have been damaged and destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, whose shoulder and back were fractured, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated for continued strong post-seismic shocks.
When she recounted her feelings about the strong earthquake that shook the fifth floor room of the hotel in which she, her husband and daughter were present, tears were flowing in her eyes.
Harris told Associated Press: “We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the ruins of the wall,” he added, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and asking for help, but then her voice was silenced.
I don’t know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are in a safe place.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Being “Zorgo” With “Propaganda”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in one of the U.S. newspapers about the bilateral benefits of the China-U.S. agreement, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to publish propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a money-laundering annex in Des Moines Register, the state’s best-selling newspaper, after China accused it of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, which China rejected.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election showed what U.S. officials told Reuters was the beginning of a new phase of escalation of pressure on China by Washington.
While ad orders to promote trade are commonplace for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has led to tariffs on each other’s goods.
Chinese and U.S. experts said retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Lowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who has long been the governor of Lowa and one of the largest exporters of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote, “China continues to be bullied by publishing propaganda in our free press.”
Branstad wrote, “The Chinese government is taking advantage of the popular tradition of free speech and press in the United States by publishing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register.”
“Instead, you see that there are limited opposing voices in the newspaper stall here on Beijing Street, and you don’t see any real reflection of what people might think about China’s worrisome economic trajectory, because the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has refused to accept the paper’s offer,” although he did not say which newspaper he meant.
Analysts warn Republicans with the Kavanaugh scandal are evading female voters from midterm elections.
Analysts have warned that as many Republicans face multiple allegations of rape, defending the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and insisting on his election, this would lead to a counter-reaction, especially on the part of women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding this issue is overwhelming, and most Republicans have shown on record that they want to make progress with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday, “These things cannot be reversed.”
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) minute support for the FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to a report in the Washington Post, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Movement, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and November.”
Mic reported that despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans are in control of the Judiciary Committee chosen to prosecute Kavanaugh’s nomination, protesters protested in the Senate hallway on Friday morning and shouted, “November is on the way!”
Stu Rothenberg, a neutral analyst, told the news site: “Democrats’ passion and motivation is growing tremendously.”
“People say that this passion was already high, that’s true.
But it could go even higher, especially among women voters who are skeptical, as well as young people between the ages of 18 and 29 who often don’t vote even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ms. Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of rape against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had said there would be a counter-reaction if Republicans backed her approval.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week that “this has become a complex problem for the GOP.”
Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, told the news channel: “It’s not just the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be tried, it’s the way Republicans have handled the issue and how they treat him.”
After all, Americans seem to be hesitant after testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh about who to believe, but the latter seems to be a bit more pro-choice.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony either definitively or possibly, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh’s testimony definitively or possibly.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had definitely or probably lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent believed in Ford.
The Guardian reported that after the announcement of Flake’s support, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford was sworn in to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, testifying that Kavanaugh had raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate, while studying at Yale in the 1980s, had attended a party together, showed her genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on the open-source Erners-Lee platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information they are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea behind Inrupt was “global dominance.”
He said of the startup, “We have to do it now.”
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses solid technology to allow individuals to create their own “online data storage space” or POD.
This space can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available simultaneously in one browser.
What makes this online storage of personal information unique is that it entirely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this capability “personal empowerment through information.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea is that the company can provide the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have contracted to work on the project, and a collection of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were “not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change that would overturn all of their business models overnight.”
“We don’t allow them.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release on Saturday that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when the World Wide Web Consortium created the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the net neutrality debate in recent months.
Berners-Lee will remain open even with the launch of Inrupt, the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Information Institute.
Berners-Lee added: “I’m incredibly optimistic about the next web era.
Bernard Vann, the priest who received the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was able to receive the Victorian Cross as a warrior in World War I was honored in his hometown on the occasion of the centenary of the award.
Reverend Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never informed that he had received Britain’s highest military honour.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said: “It was “symbolical and clever” to unveil the monument 100 years after his grandfather’s masterpiece that led to the honor.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion at the Canal de Saint-Quentin “during a thick fog under heavy fire of cannons and guns.”
He later attacked the line of fire and, with "all the courage" alone and before the ball hit, he pushed the line forward and dismantled the three groups.
Colonel Vann II was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never be as good as but considered small.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a floral crown on the ground to commemorate him after the parade, led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Group.
Michael Vann said, “He’s very proud to have played a part in the parade,” adding that “the courage of a true hero is shown with the support of so many people.”
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching a Bellator 206 just to avoid the main event.
The San Jose bills included 13 fights, including six on the main card that aired live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the TV coverage was cut off and the Peppa Pig cartoon was broadcast, leaving the British viewers stunned and angry.
Some of them felt bad after they had been awake to watch the fight until the early hours of the morning.
A Twitter fan called the change to children’s cartoons a “painful joke.”
When asked about the change, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said: “It’s a government regulation that at 6 a.m., this content is not appropriate, so they had to change the program to children’s cartoons.”
“Peppa Pig, yes.”
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they plan to work on their plans to cover the UK audience in the future.
Coker said, “When I think of replaying, I think we can think of something to do with it.”
“But in that case, it was Sunday at 6 a.m. and we can’t think of a plan for it until Sunday and Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change was made, a lot of messages were exchanged and these messages were not friendly.
We were trying to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won’t happen in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five - like what we usually do - this time we tried to provide extra service to fans and we just tried it.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "humiliated" for sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said she didn’t realize until she went to high school that “not everyone looks like me.”
In his first radio 4 Desert Island Discs show, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give “hope” to the rest.
He also said that becoming a father has made him no longer care about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the main host of the old show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who took part in the first Laverne program as an outcast, said he felt “humiliated” with everyone else because “socially, it was unacceptable to love boys and girls.”
“To date, this sense of inferiority and differentity has been the real thing that has given me the strength and ability to succeed.”
She said she wanted to prove she was an “important person” in a way that would not disappoint her when others learned about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist turned into a well-known LGBT campaigner, using her presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said he speaks openly because he feels lucky to have been able to live openly and without negative consequences and wants to “give hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black who met him in 2013 – “I was surprised.”
Daley married an Oscar-winning 20-year-old man last year, but said the age gap had never been a problem.
“When you’re making so much progress at such a young age” – he went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had a child in June with a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “general outlook” had changed.
“If you had asked me a year ago, all I wanted was to win the gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether he still had tickets for the 2012 Olympics — because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said, “I couldn’t tell him you weren’t supposed to be there to be in the front row, Dad.”
“When he stopped breathing, I held his hand, and when he really stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he wasn’t invincible.”
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in front of a crowd of my own country at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that,” he said.
This also inspired him to make his first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – which he was associated with when he reached the Olympics and still has a lot of interest in.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson sat on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record by playing in the 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but come on form to avoid turning it into an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the double-year event for the 12th time, was featured on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-player Saturday games.
The great player, who has a record five wins in a row, instead of being at the center of the game as he often did when he went to the United States, spent his day working as the leader of the audience and trying to improve his game on the ball in the hopes that he could fix his problems.
The 48-year-old, who has never been one of the best hitters in his career, is not a good choice for the tough Le Golf National competitions, which usually involve long-distance shoots around the golf course.
And if the competition itself isn’t daunting enough, Mickelson will face the exact winner of the British Open on Sunday, Francesco Molinari, who is teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind despite starting 12 solo matches, have a good start, the Mickelson race can be very crucial and decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his players, but nothing else could be said.
Furyk said, “He fully understood the role he played yesterday, he admired me, and he put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow.”
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has won a lot of awards and in the past and this week, these teams have learned a lot from him.
I didn’t think he would play in two games.
I thought it was more than that, but that’s how it went and I think we should accept that.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which can never be as good as his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, however Furyk said his presence is an intangible asset for the team.
He said: “He’s a great player, he’s a great player, he’s a great player, he’s a great player.
“I think the younger players are having fun criticizing him, including this week, which was spectacular.
“In addition to playing, he brings us a lot more.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that their decisive dominance could soon be gone.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that stepping into the final day of the Ryder Cup singles tournament with a significant advantage can easily turn into an unpleasant ending.
The Danish golfer began his career in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans but managed to win in the end with a close 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>214-1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>213 result.
Bjorn, after watching the 2018 3-5 wins on Friday and yesterday, which led to a 6-10 win at Le Golf National, visualized those memories: “Remember that we had a decisive advantage at Valderrama, we had a decisive advantage at Brookline, we lost and we won at Valderrama, but we were a little bit farther away.
So history has shown me and all the people on the team that the game is not over.
Tomorrow you must go to the field with all your might.
Go there and do the right thing.
Until the scores are recorded on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal and our goal is to try to win the cup and your focus should be on that goal.
“I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players in our team, but we’re fully aware of the team that’s in front of us – the biggest players in the world.”
Bjorn added: “I never judge this early on.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that determines everything, and that's a different thing to do.
When everything is going well, it’s great to be on the field with a teammate, but when you’re on the field alone, your abilities as a golfer are thoroughly tested.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, deliver your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you leave your teammate and he should go and try to do his best.
In contrast to Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk will seek to make his players perform better on solos than on a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both of these big changes on the last day, he was part of the winning team at Brookline, before Europe managed to perform a “miracle in Medinah” and make him finish the game as a loser.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, prepared his players to start the final day, he said, “I remember all the damn words of that day.”
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like that quick start that you saw on Brookline to happen like you did in Medinah.
When the force moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those who are in the race.
“We will determine our composition on this basis and defeat their allies as we like, you know, tomorrow we will try to do a miracle.”
The task of trying to lead the fight is assigned to Thomas, and he meets Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, and other Europeans in the upper half of the mix, in a top-rated race with Rory McIlroy.
Bjorn said of his individual choices: “I put this group of people in this way because I think it covers all the sections.
The new German warship has been delayed again.
Local media reported that the new German navy's fleet had to be completed in 2014 to be replaced by old Cold War-era ships, but due to system failures and high cost, it will not be ready until at least next year.
According to a military spokesman, the completion and dispatch of the main Rheinland-Pfalz from the new Baden-Württemberg fleet has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troublesome delivery has put the fate of the ambitious project in jeopardy.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
It is clear that the ships will use a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as several radar technologies such as radar, infrared and sound reduction.
Other important features include a longer retention period - it is likely that new ships will be able to operate for a maximum of two years away from their own shores.
However, continued delays mean that these modern vessels - which are said to be allowing Germany to increase its power in overseas waters - will be obsolete until it enters the Navy.
Last year, when the German navy officially refused to deploy the unsuccessful F125 and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the issue sparked widespread media outrage.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship after it was delivered to the shipyard.
There is little information about the reasons for the return, but German media have quoted a number of “software and hardware” defects that used the navy as a combat mission.
Software defects are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors — which is only half the manpower of the older Bremen class ships.
It was also found that the ship was significantly heavier than the standard, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy’s ability to add further upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavier than the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also becoming a plus.
The cost is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the new fleet are becoming particularly important given the warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the navy was “really finishing up deployable ships.”
The official said the problem had escalated over time as the old ships were out of service, but alternatives were not provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class ships had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats.
New research is underway in part of the Scottish Highlands to determine how bats use the area to hunt food.
The findings are expected to reveal new angles of the behavior of these unique mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, tracks short-legged and dwarf bats, as well as long-eared bats and bats in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registers will be placed in key locations around the area to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile mapping using handheld detectors.
A specialized voice analysis will determine all the recordings, the frequency of the bat’s sound, as well as what each type does.
A map and report of their habitat will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behavior at the region scale.
Natural Conservation Advisor for NTS Rob Dewar expressed hope, saying the results will determine which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, including the creation of grasslands and how to preserve forests best for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have declined dramatically in Scotland and across the UK.
They are threatened by construction work and development that affects their nests and destroys their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be hazardous to them, as well as insecticide paper and some chemical compositions of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use a complex echoing technique to determine the exact location of insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They have ten trained specialists who perform regular, mapping operations, nesting checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even designated the Threave lands in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species, as the first and only protected area of bats in Scotland.
District manager David Thompson says the area is the ideal territory for them.
He said, “Here at Threave, we have a very good area for bats.”
“We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitats.
But there’s a lot that’s still unknown about bats, so what we’re doing here and in other areas will help us figure out what else they need to grow.”
He underscored the importance of checking for bats before they are repaired in buildings, as the involuntary destruction of a mother bat's nest could lead to the death of up to 400 female and young bats, potentially destroying an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass and disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged people to help with seriousness.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don’t know how their populations will survive,” he said.
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape and Lawyers Strictly Track Complaints to German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news” and said people “would like to use his name to make themselves famous.”
Her lawyers are seeking to file a complaint with the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus teams have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he had allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident.
The 33-year-old, who spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram hours after reporting the claims, vehemently denied the claims and called them “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
The five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera: “What they said today was fake news.”
“They want to make themselves famous by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous by taking my name, but that’s part of my job.”
The player added with a smile, “I’m a happy person and everything is going well.”
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the claims, which he called “invalid reports of unverified privacy information.”
Christian Schertz’s lawyer said the player was seeking compensation for “spiritual damage to a degree proportionate to the attractiveness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations in the field of individual rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to available documents from the district court of Clark County, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player’s room after meeting at the nightclub, claiming that Ronaldo had raped her from the anus.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told him he was “99%” a “good person” and “one%” a bad one.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed outside the courtroom because she felt “horrified of retaliation” and worried about “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to break the deal due to the ongoing trauma of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged rape, Ronaldo was on the verge of splitting from Manchester United and joining Real Madrid, and joined the Italian team Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: Losing a car maker will lead to “everyday regret” for England
Trade Minister Greg Clark has said that if the UK loses its position as a global leader in automobiles after Brexit, it would be a "perpetual regret."
It is “worrying” that the UK unit of Toyota told the BBC it would temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement.
Mr Clark said: “We need an agreement.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays could cost jobs if there was no deal.
Burnaston, which manufactures Auris and Avensis cars for Toyota, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston, said: “My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March, we will see a production stop at our factory.”
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how the offshore trade will operate.
For example, BMW says a month after Brexit, it will close its mini manufacturing plant in Oxford.
The main concern about what automakers say is related to the risks of the supply chain in the event of a non-agreement exit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “right time” principle, so that parts from UK and EU suppliers arrive at the factory every 37 minutes to make cars based on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, it could be disrupted at the borders, which industries say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota said it would be impossible for us to keep our inventory at the Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Chequers’ plan for future relations with the EU was “exactly designed to prevent these problems at the border.”
“We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement to allow us, as I say, not only to succeed at the moment but to make the most of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The issue that has been raised not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers is that we should be able to fully continue to use this successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run, these additional costs could reduce factory competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the United Union recall, said the union’s concerns are growing: “Based on my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never be revived.
A government spokesman said: “We need to come up with a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
White House says Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday that with the ongoing controversy over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s risky meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “may be delayed by another week.”
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election and the link between Russia and Trump's aid and the possible impeachment of the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence has sparked rumours in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein raised the issue of having a microphone to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House despite reports of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer” not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was adjourned for another time to prevent it from interfering with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blize Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations for another week, leading to further delays in the court’s ruling.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s deputy press secretary, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, given the other issues going on in the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But let’s see what happens, and I always like to give the latest news to the press.
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the reason for this.
Sanders said the lack of information about the meetings was not due to a lack of interest in television reporters, although he said he "does not disagree with the fact that they are seeking media attention."
He then offered to increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than previous presidents,” he added, without mentioning evidence, “we’ve looked at those numbers.”
The briefing will still be presented, but if the press has the opportunity to speak directly to the president.
“We’re trying to make these meetings more frequent, and you’ve seen a lot of these meetings over the past few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, these meetings will take the place of press meetings.”
Trump responds to questions while leaving the White House or attending free meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown the reason for this, and appeared in front of a crowd of reporters freely and strangely.
The Minister of Health writes a letter to EU staff at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) about concerns about Brexit.
In a letter to employees of the European Union working in the National Organization for Healthcare, the Minister expressed his country’s gratitude to them and wished them to remain in the post-Brexit phase.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jean Freeman, wrote a letter stating that the UK was less than six months away from leaving the European Union.
The Scottish government has pledged to pay for requests for finalized status for EU citizens working in underserved public services organizations.
In her letter, Freeman said: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal of Adame are moving towards the anticipated decisions that will be made in the fall.
But the UK government is also increasing its readiness for a non-conflict scenario.
I know this must be a very sad time for you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I value each member now, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners across the European Union and beyond bring with them valuable experiences and skills that will strengthen and improve the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities I serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we’d love for you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after being hit by a head injury
According to Mike Organ from Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers backer, underwent an emergency surgery on Saturday against Wenderbilt Commodore after he suffered a head injury on 31-27.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened a few minutes before halftime.
Reid said, “He went off the line and then fell to the ground.”
Trainers and medical staff were oxygenated to the sidelines before Abercrombie was placed on the cradle and transferred to the crater for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV network in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie’s surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added: “There are no details yet on the type and extent of the injury, and Tennessee State is working to find out when the injury occurred.
The second-year athlete, Abercrombie, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five full-length tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the number of tackles of his season to 18.
Foreign buyers in the U.S. will have to pay more when buying property in the U.S.
Foreign property buyers in the United Kingdom will face additional stamping costs, and additional costs will be spent on helping the homeless covered by the new grid schemes.
This move will thwart the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters.
An increase in the price of tax stamps will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Department predicts that this amount will increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to pay more tax stamps when buying property in the United Kingdom — and the surplus will be paid to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters by promising cheaper housing and targeting higher-income people.
The increase in tax stamps will apply to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes, and the surplus will help move the government to combat the dilemma of sleeping cartons.
This additional fee – which is included in the current tax stamp fee and includes the higher tax rates announced two years ago on second homes purchased and then rented homes – will be up to 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Nearly 13 percent of new London homes are bought by residents outside the United Kingdom, making it harder for first-time buyers to buy.
Many of the country’s most prosperous regions – especially in the capital – have become a “spiritual city” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy began just weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of tax cuts to help young people become homeowners.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by acquiring land and misusing it, and asked Ms. May to abandon the quota of cheaper homes to regulate “homelessness” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has made a series of interesting suggestions for housing reforms, including controlling the rental of the house and ending the evacuation without committing an error.
He also wants to give city councils more powers to build new houses.
“Last year I said I would give priority to the prime minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market dilemma.
The doors of the UK are always open to those who want to create a new life and work here.
However, it's not true that buying a home is as easy for people who don't live here or foreign companies as it is for the hardworking UK residents.
For many, the dream of becoming a homeowner is very unlikely, and the shame of sleeping in cartons is a very bitter reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ambition is to run Scotland.”
Sunderland President Jack Ross says his “highly ambitious” ambition is to become Scotland’s future director.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the revival of the North-East club, which is currently third in the Premier League, with a three-point difference.
After relegating St. Mirren to the Premier League last season, he moved to the Lightning Stadium this summer.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Ross told BBC Sports Radio: “I got a B grade, that’s all.”
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland at Hamptons, and that’s what always fascinates me.
However, this opportunity only comes when I’m successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as directors of Sunderland include Dick Educott, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canino.
The former Alva Athletic president said he was not afraid of such prestigious names who had sought the club, and had previously rejected Barnesley and Ipswich’s proposals.
“At the moment, the criteria for success for me is, ‘Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?’
“Because of the structure and facilities of the club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League.”
“It’s not easy to get the team to the Premier League, but if I can bring the team back, I’ll be successful.”
After completing a course as head assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching career at Hart, Ross has only been in the management field for three years.
He then prevented the Alva team from crashing, bringing them back to the third position in the table, and the following season, Saint-Marin from a team on the verge of crashing to win the title.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and the Hamilton Academy.
Assuming responsibility for the Aluva team, he said it was “perhaps a real milestone.”
I definitely believed that the management was right for me, much more than playing.
It seems strange because I was good, I made a good life for myself, and I enjoyed a high social status.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do during the week.
“I’m still going through stress and pressure, but I feel very well managed.
“I’ve always wanted to manage, and now I’m doing it, it’s the best feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

Research shows that the ideal time for a glass of beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased sales of struggling British pubs, but has put a lot of pressure on the chain.
The pubs and bars group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant sales declined 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, said: “Continuous sunshine and a longer partnership than the UK expected at the World Cup means that July will follow the same pattern from the month before June, when pubs saw a 2.8 percent increase in sales, expect restaurants to hit harder.
Restaurant sales declined by 1.8 percent in June, worsening in July.
Pubs that serve drinks and bars often performed much better than their counterparts in most restaurants that saw a drop in sales.
The pubs that serve food also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
People seem to be going out to drink.
Among pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6% this month, and food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, an RSM welfare and hospitality analyst, said: “These results show the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to selling on the outside market, the weather and the impact of major sporting and social events are the most important factors.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group is still struggling, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales each year will be much more painful given the continued rise in cost pressures.
“This long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for grocery stores, and time will determine whether the cool weather we experienced in August will provide some of the much-needed deadlines for these jobs.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, plus newcomers, was 2.7% in July, indicating a decline in the supply of new products to the market by major brands.
The Khilafah Industry Tracking Monitoring System on the sale of UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 working groups, totaling a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is a valid standard in the industry.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents don't know about.
Research shows that one in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers don’t know about.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows the growth of “fake Instagram pages.”
The news raises concerns about the publication of sexual content on these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had an “original” account to show their parents.
One in five children – some even by the age of 11 – create social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in “Insta fake accounts” – referrals to an Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raises concerns about the publication of sexual content on these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “original” account to show their parents, while they had other hidden accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter noticed a teenage girl calling for “rape me.”
In a study conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and MHC, 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having hidden accounts.
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very sad that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.
Ilide Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Sports Board.
Elid Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Sports Board at the current government's annual general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prominent athlete in athletics, and board chairman Len Beatty saw the move as an opportunity for sports pioneers to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Ilead is highly respected across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international athletes’ community, and we are sure to benefit greatly from bringing him to the Scottish Athletes’ Board,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I am looking forward to playing as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and lead the Scottish sport.
The American athlete, who won four Olympic gold medals in the Atlanta Olympic 200m and 400m race in 1996 and is now a permanent BBC expert, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, on this day, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can determine if I can recover and how much I will recover.
It was really hard work, but I recovered completely, learned how to walk again, and I’m doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
Advertising on breast pumps by comparing mothers with cows has created a rift in online reviews.
A breast pump company has created a rift in online reviews by promoting comparisons between breastfeeding mothers and cows who are breastfeeding.
Consumer technology company Elvie has released a funny music video to inspire advertising to show the freedom that the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a storehouse full of cow stubble with the lyrics: “Yes, I’m breastfeeding myself, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you don’t notice, these are not cow breasts, these are my breasts.”
He continued, "I give milk to the children, I give milk to the children, I give milk to the women, I give milk to the women."
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a variety of reactions from viewers, many of whom said it would make the “horror” of the dairy industry a joke.
“Using cows to promote this product is a very poor decision.
Someone wrote, “Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except that their babies are kidnapped a few days later.”
Elvie’s breast pump is secretly placed in the nurse’s/mother’s bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: “Comprehensiblely sad for the mother and the baby.
But why shouldn’t we use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “What an incomprehensible advertisement.”
Some supported the ad, such as the woman who claimed the song was “joyful.”
“I think it’s a good idea.
If I were to breastfeed my baby again, I’d be willing to have one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
It was a bit silly, but I accepted it as it was.
Someone wrote, “This is a smart product.”
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad and it’s addressed to mothers who pump their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and give them a sense of being a cow.
This is not an advertisement for acclaim or judgment of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with hidden pumps in their breasts.
The concept behind this ad is based on an insight that believes that most women who pump their milk say it makes them feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and is hidden inside the bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold babies, and even go out while pumping.
Anna Balarin, a co-author and psychologist for child development at the mother’s organization, said Elvie’s pump is like a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and controversial introduction.
By depicting the similarities between the women and the lactating cows, we wanted to put the breast pumps and all of their challenges under the microscope, while at the same time demonstrating the fun and understandable sense of freedom that these pumps will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s pump has been headlined.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the fashion scene while using the product for fashion designer Marta Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
While the figures for illegal crossings have been relatively steady, the number of detained immigrant children has risen sharply, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration, which has made it harder to find support for children.
In the past, most of their supporters were immigrants without legal documents, so they fear they could be jeopardized by taking steps to protect their children living inside the country.
When federal officials announced that potential sponsors and adults in their families had to give fingerprints, and that information was being shared with immigration officials, the risk increased.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior U.S. immigration and customs official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had registered to support children.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who were either sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegally residing in the country, and many of them are foreign criminals,” Albens said.
We are looking for those people.”
In order to speed up the process of prosecuting children, officials announced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court one month after their arrest, instead of the previous standard that allowed them to appear in court 60 days after their arrest.
Many, rather than personal appearances, come to defend themselves to obtain a legal residency status against an immigration judge via video conferencing.
Those who do not qualify for legal protection are quickly fired.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more children remain in detention, the more they are exposed to stress and anxiety, which can lead to violence or attempted escape.
Proponents said concerns had peaked in larger centers such as Trenillo, where signs of a child being in trouble due to the large size of the center may have been overlooked.
Moving children to tent towns without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are currently struggling with.
Syria ordered U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to leave immediately.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Syria’s Foreign Minister Walid Maqsood said that despite the war in the country being in its eighth year, he had asked the refugees to return to their homes.
The teacher, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be treated appropriately.
He told the assembly: “They must leave the country as soon as possible without any conditions.”
The teacher stressed that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, in which more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
“We will continue this holy war until we clear all areas of Syria from terrorist groups and the presence of any illegal foreign force,” he said.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground forces in a war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, the teacher said the conditions were conducive to their return, and blamed some Western countries for creating irrational fears that would keep refugees away from Syria.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
They have turned a purely humanitarian issue into a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that unless an agreement is reached between Assad and opposition forces to end the war, Syria will not be given any assistance to rebuild.
U.N. diplomats say the recent Syria-Turkey deal has created a hailstorm in Idlib’s main rebel base area, which has opened up an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey deal prevented a massive attack by Syrian-backed forces on a place where three million people live.
However, the teacher stressed that the agreement had a “certain deadline” and hoped that military operations would target jihadists, including al-Nusra fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda.
U.N. envoy Stephen Demistra hopes to hold the first meeting of the new government-appointed committee and members of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
The teacher explained the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the working group should be “restricted to review the constitutional material” and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win the next round
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless liberal observers hope that his impeachment and scandal will end before his term ends.
“This will undoubtedly be the saddest end to the presidency in U.S. history.”
Currently, there is no sign of the helplessness of the observers.
Since 2014, the most-watched hourly rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has 2.4 million viewers in the most-watched hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow program with more than 3.5 million viewers on important news nights has reached the top of cable TV shows.
Neil Bayer, the producer of ABC’s “Selected Survivors,” said of a cabinet minister who was “destroying the Capitol” after an attack: “It’s the fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand.”
Neil Scowell, a well-known comedian and author of “Only Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Ruining the Hollywood Boys Club,” has another theory.
He remembers a day before the 2016 election when he was in a taxi in Boston.
The driver told him he wanted to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asks why?
“Mrs. Scowell said to me, ‘She said because it makes me laugh.’”
Chaos has a lot of fun.
Certainly, like nothing else on television, the stories coming out of Washington will turn the future against Wade, whether the families of immigrants can be together again and determine the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a matter that only those with special privileges can overcome.
And yet, when you realize that for six hours you've been watching a group of experts discussing the use of the "deep background" for Bob Woodward's book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, and the hidden meanings of the rough description of a citizen, Stormy Daniels, of Mr. Trump.
As a person, I no longer look at Super Mario the same as before.
Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Stars in Rotation, says that Trump’s television show “part of what he does to make you feel like a real show” gives you something every night.
You can’t lose a part of it, so you’re left behind.
When I met Mr. Felice this week, it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit outside on the north coast of Kawaii, but he was watching MSNBC indoors while recording CNN.
He could not take it, he could not take it from Brett Cavanaugh, who had to face the House Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court, which was uncertain.
Mr. Felice told me, “I remember when we were doing those ridiculous shows in the past, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’”
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Funds from abroad became the toughest domestic mid-term election campaign.
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is witnessing a flurry of money thanks to the unification of congressional districts that led to two rivals competing for a seat.
This has recently led to a regional restructuring of the Democratic Party in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. Conor Lamb – who won a regional special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with other Republican rivals, Kate Ratfos, who recently ran for the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, and the area is heavily interfering with the new 17th district.
The maps were changed after the Supreme Court of the Old Territories declared in January that it was unconstitutional and unfairly divided in favor of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district led to heavy competition between the financial branches of major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name came to light after a close contest and a victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District, which was witnessed by many.
The seat was run by the Republican Party for a decade, and Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political experts have a positive view of the Democrats.
The U.S. stopped El Salvador’s punishment for supporting China at the time.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama, with a little distance from Washington, have already accepted Beijing.
Mr Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the Trump administration’s management team was sacked.
State Department spokesman Heather Noert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to call senior U.S. officials from the diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the “recent decision not to support Taiwan.”
But the penalty was only imposed on El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid for drug control, development and financial support from Americans.
The proposed punishment, which included reducing financial aid and imposing visa restrictions, had a painful effect on the Central American country and the high unemployment rate and the number of murders.
As domestic meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to attend a meeting similar to last year, a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking government officials had made it clear they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any El Salvadoran penal review.
Diplomats said it was planned that Vice President Mike Pence, at the conference, which is scheduled to be held in mid-October, would make a speech, indicating the importance the government attaches to the gathering.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic immediately without any serious warning or punishment from Washington.
Three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats and have agreed to discuss domestic negotiations on the condition that they remain anonymous, said Mr. Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to elaborate on the details explained by three U.S. officials.
Their explanation was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the government to anonymity conditions.
Study History
The next inevitable event could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of law enforcement, where there is sufficient evidence in the public mind.
According to the report, Mueller is investigating whether Mr Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia to attack our elections.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will see himself responding to Congress at the right time as he prepares to confront voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
Of course, but if it does, and I don’t mean that the fall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make decisions that will affect how long this will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup d’etat against Hitler, only to be resisted by the West and to support the Czech Slovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to prevent the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such milestones, and the inevitable parade of democracy slows or accelerates.
Americans are now facing several such milestones.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired the deputy attorney general, General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the news was published last year when he suggested that he secretly record the president’s conversations and comment on Trump’s inappropriate personality for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was not accurate.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is summoned to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, do we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm elections?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will fall into a long hibernation.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz detention center by the same Nazi regime that occupied my ambassadorial home.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a broken Nazi cross.

Norman Eisen, a senior member of the Brookings Institution, is the head of the Citizens’ Organization for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and the author of “The Last Palace: Europe’s Rumorous Century in Five Lives and a Mythical House.”
Graham Durans from the Rangers is optimistic about the match against Wayne.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they know that a win against Austria, after an equal result against Spain earlier this month, will strengthen their position in the Europa League Group G to advance to the next level.
The injury to Graham Doris’ knee area prevented the team from making its first appearance in the new season until a 2-2 equaliser with Viral, but he believes the Rangers could use this as a launching pad for bigger successes.
The 31-year-old said: “It was a good point for us because Viareal is a good team.
“We entered the game with the belief that we could achieve something and came out with a point.
“Maybe we could get that ball in the end, but overall, it was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we looked better in the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
“Fortunately, we can score three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game, but with the crowd supporting them, I’m sure we can put pressure and get a positive result.
“Last year was a really tough year, despite what happened to my injuries and the changes that have taken place at the club itself, I feel good here.
The players are in good condition and the kids really enjoy it; the training is good.
“Fortunately, we can move forward, get past last season and be successful.”
Worrying about retirement savings steals sleep from women’s eyes
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, some were talking about it with their families.
About half of those in the Nationwide study said they would talk to their spouses about the long-term cost of care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
Holly Schneider, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide, said: “People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t go ahead with the conversation.”
This is where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t set your desires at the right time, you can’t prepare your family for care.
Talk to your legal counsel and your family about where and how to get care, as these elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care can include a common long-term insurance policy, or life insurance based on the value of the money to cover these costs, or self-esteem with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Make sure you have a clear record of what you are doing, and you will be rewarded with a fair trial.
Prepare a health care lawyer to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care, and if you are unable to communicate, make sure that specialists will agree to your demands.
Also, keep in mind the use of attorney letters in financial matters.
You choose a confident person to make your financial decisions and make sure that the bills are paid if you are not able to.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he is using and the sensitivities he has?
Bring the details to the section on paper, so you’re ready.
Mr. Martin asked, “Not only do financial matters play a role, but who the doctors are, too?”
What medicines are used?
Who took care of the dog?
Keep these in mind.”

The victim, at age 40, was in the Grove area of Oxford in Ilfracombe, Devon, where she was hit by a gorge from her chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as a "spread shooting."
The victim has not seen the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and police have called for eyewitness testimony.
Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communication lines, relief officials were unable to obtain information from the Dangala region, north of Palu, which is the closest to the center of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 residents were evacuated.
Some of the key facts about Palau and Dangala on the island of Salavis include:
Palo is the capital of the central region of Salamis, located at the end of the narrow bay west of the island of Salamis, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dangala is an area stretching over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the northwestern coastline of the island of Salavasi.
It is a smaller administrative region than a province, with a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture is the main economy in the center of Salavasi, especially in the coastal part of Dangal.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but most of the mines in Morvali are concentrated in the opposite part of Salavisi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Management Agency, Palo and Dangala have been hit by a number of tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dangalla.
Another tsunami in West Dangal in 1996 killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the ring of fire in the Atlantic Ocean, and earthquakes occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes have occurred in recent years:
2004: The Great Earthquake on the West Coast of Akha Indonesia in Northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a major tsunami that damaged 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Akha.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes rocked the West Coast of Sumatra in March and April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake in southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on one of the islands of Mantawa, Sumatra, triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages, killing nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the Piedya region of Ake caused panic and fear in people who recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed as they fell from the building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lambek, killing 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and vice president-elect candidate, was arrested on charges of rape.
According to the Alaska State Police report on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin, from Vasilisa, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tries to call the police to report the crime, she takes her phone away from him.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the pre-trial Met-Su building and holds $500 in anonymous bonds.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself “innocent” when his defenses were sought.
Palin faces three first-degree crimes, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree offence, which resulted in a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently in the hands of a retired Alaskan military court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in the reporting of domestic violence, and carrying a firearm while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by retired military groups for attributing her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder for his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an Indonesian earthquake on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the likelihood of casualties is high in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the center of Salavasi, north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the moment of the incident.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palo.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for New York terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York seek death penalty for Syphalo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people -- a rare punishment not imposed on federal crimes since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out the murder on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, taking down pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims “in large part” and “in large part” caused serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both of them have the possibility of a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a top federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of smuggling aid, a charge commonly used by the federal prosecutor to refer to organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required “a lot of detailed planning and planning” and described what Saipov had done as “atrocious, cruel and perverted act.”
Saifullah Habibullah Uych Saipov was injured, injured and killed by family members and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne Lore Dickett, Darren Derrick, Ariel Erleigh, Hernan Frochy, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnou.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the last death penalty case in the southern New York region.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court records, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express remorse during the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told detectives he felt good about what he had done.
According to the report, Saipov told the authorities that the motive for the assassination was created after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone.
Police also said he had also requested that the Islamic State flag be hoisted in the hospital.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who advocates for Yaipovo, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
Patton said: “We think the decision to issue the death penalty instead of agreeing to the offender’s request to issue a life sentence without the possibility of release would only prolong the trauma of these events for those involved.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to “move the people’s army into action today in protest of the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader said politicians should “confront the pressure of the closest opposition between the UK and the EU” – as MP Theresa May suggested she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Peter Boone, a member of the House of Commons legislature, told marches in Birmingham that Britain had already left if Mr. Fraj was elected secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces in reconciling her two-party cabinet has been addressed by conservative groups supporting Britain’s stay in the European Union, which have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to pursue a plan of unanimous exit amidst the attacks of Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted that, despite strong reactions, he would try to make a deal with Brussels – and force the closest opposition forces between the UK and the EU and the Labour Party to choose between his proposed package or ‘chaos’.
Mr. Boone at the Quitting Society, which was held in Solihull, said he wanted to “stop the plan of exit without agreement.”
He suggested that Mr. Fraz should consider colleagues for the responsibilities given to the Brussels negotiations.
“If he had taken the responsibility, we would have been out by now,” he said.
Wellenberg said: “I’m ready for Brexit, but we need to stop the plan of a non-negotiable exit.”
While expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to fall asleep.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn rejected the idea that public opinion had changed since 2016, saying, “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in Europe is completely false.”
Andre A. Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Party, was also on the march, saying to reporters: "I have to say very simply: Prime Minister! Listen to the people.
The exit without an agreement is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our political activists, who actually work in the streets and make us elected representatives, are not interested in this plan.
Please drop the plan without agreement and start listening.
In a snippet message to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.
Qi Faraz told the protesters that if politicians were to break the 2016 referendum decision, they would be forced to “confront the pressure.”
He said: “This is a matter of trust between us, the people and the political class.
They want to betray Britain’s exit from the EU, but we’re here today to tell them, “We’re not going to let you enter the palace.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: “I urge you to form our political group, so that those who are on the brink of betraying Britain’s exit from the European Union can cope with the pressure.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that will lead to our victory in Britain’s exit from the European Union, and we will never rest until we have an independent, self-governing and proud England.”
At the same time, supporters of remaining in the European Union have marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the Conservative Party's anti-Brexit group began its work on the weekend, few activists hoisted the party's banners.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, ridiculed the Conservatives at the start of the conference for security issues of a party program.
“These are people who tell us they can install IT systems and they can provide all the technology needed for Canada Plus to have a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland.”
This is totally ridiculous.
He said there was no such thing as a good UK exit from the EU.
Warren plans to “think carefully” about his presidential candidacy.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she “thinks carefully” about her presidential candidacy after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a perpetual critic of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November to compete against Republican&Jeffrey Dihl, who was the president of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
He has been at the center of speculation that he might be a rival to Trump in the 2020 election.
The incident took place Saturday afternoon in Hollyoke, his 36th meeting with the electorate, which has been held in the form of a public meeting since Trump’s presidency.
One of the attendees asked him if he wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to reform and rebuild our messed up government, and that requires a woman to be in the top spot.”
Man Arrested During Shooting at Louisiana State University
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in Friday’s shooting of a basketball player at Louisiana State University, Wide Sims, was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said at a press conference at 11 a.m. that Dayton Simpson, 20, had been arrested.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the film.
Simms, 20, was shot dead near the university's southern campus on Friday morning.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports that “Wade Sims was shot in the head and eventually died.”
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene with a gun, and admitted to firing at Wide Samiz.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is in detention at the East Roge Concrete District Police Department.
Samiz, a 182-centimeter young man who grew up in Concrete Rogue, has played 32 matches and has been a 10-time bowler in the last season, scoring an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: After the team led Lewis Hamilton to victory over Sebastian Vettel, Lewis took another step closer as a world champion.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas overtakes Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team will play a big part in the race.
Butas had a good start from the first line, and almost separated from Hamilton to defend his place in the first two turns, allowing Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter Pit Stop and let Hamilton fall into the traffic of the last cars, something that would definitely happen.
Mercedes entered the pit stop a little later and appeared from behind the motel, but Hamilton, after a few moves very close, fell to the side of the car as the fugitive's driver reluctantly separated from the middle of the road and risked third place after a double move.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back row and finished seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then, for most of the race, he was number one, and he didn’t change his tires because he wanted to get to the finish line quickly, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
He eventually entered the Pit Stop in the 44th round, but failed to speed up in the remaining eight rounds, finishing fourth at Rickon.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a wonderful job this weekend, and he was a really nice guy who let me pass.
Hamilton said the team has done an exceptional job with two winners.
Nonverbal communication was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finstein at an election rally on Saturday for her insistence on not disclosing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on charges of rape.
The president, speaking at an election rally in West Virginia, did not directly comment on Ford’s testimony on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows how much people are “posts, dirty and liars.”
“What might happen in the Senate, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days, is that when you see anger, you see people who are nervous, ugly, dirty and liars.”
“They publish and expose the news and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.’
“I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you disclosed this?
Remember his answer... Have you disclosed the document? “Oh, oh, what do you say?”
“Oh, no.
I have not disclosed.”
Well, wait a minute.
In a similar tone to the senator, he added: “Have we disclosed the news?... No, we haven’t.
A letter has been sent to Feinstein, in which Ford made allegations against Kavanaugh in July last year, and the contents of the letter were revealed in early September – but Feinstein has denied the disclosure from his office.
I have not concealed Dr. Ford’s allegations, I have not disclosed his issue,” part of Hill’s report quoted Feinstein’s remarks on the committee.
“He asked me to keep it secret, and I did as he asked.”
But his denial was not convincing to the president, and he criticized Saturday night’s election rally: “I’ll tell you what really happened, it was a really bad non-verbal communication issue.”
“Maybe he didn’t, but it’s the worst nonverbal communication I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexual misconduct, saying the Democrats were using the charges to their advantage.
“They are determined to take back power in every possible way.
The president’s statement came as he said: “You see the vileness, they don’t care who they hurt, they don’t care who they reject to take power.”
Premier League: Dundee Starz takes 3-5 Bluffs Giants ahead
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the match against Dundee.
Dundee Starz made up for Friday's loss in the Premier League against Belfast Giants and won the team 5-3 on Saturday.
With the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boilier, Giants managed to score two goals in the first game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equalised the game, but then Dior scored a goal for Giants.
Franco Bouchard equalized the game for Dundee, but Lucas Landwald Nielsen again scored two goals for Dundee.
This was the third Premier League defeat this season for Adam Kiev, who defeated 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, while Giants has won three previous matches with the team.
The first goal was scored by Dwayne in the fourth minute at 3:35 by Kendall McFall, and four minutes later by David Ruthford.
It was half-hearted, and Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, but Matt Markwart helped Cooney score an equal goal at 15:16.
When Dwayne scored his second goal at the end of the first half that night, he was confident that Giants would win the first half.
The hosts regained their unity on their own ground, and Bouchard drew the game again with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen beat Dundee for the first time in the second half of the last minute, and eventually won with his fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
Giants, who has now lost four of his five games, will host his next match at home on Friday with Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Sacrifices His Life to Save Hundreds of People on the Plane to Escape the Earthquake
Indonesians have dubbed the air traffic controller a hero for his self-sacrifice to secure the flight of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday left more than 800 people dead and countless missing.
Severe tremors continue to disrupt life in the area, and many people are trapped under the rubble of Palo.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agang did not leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at Motiara Sis El Jofre Airport in Palo.
He stayed there to make sure that Airbus 6321 Bacte, which was on the bandwagon at the time, was able to land safely.
And then, when he sees the tower collapse, he jumps out.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
According to ABC News Australia, Indonesian aviation spokesman Johannes Sierrath said the decision saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the plane landed in Palo.
He added: “We broke our hearts when we heard this news.
At the same time, officials are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, and the country’s natural disaster management agency says access to the cities of Dongla, Sigi and Butung is limited.
IAEA spokesman Sotopo Porvo Nogrove said: “We think the death toll will continue to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and many of them are not accessible.”
Waves of up to six metres have turned Palo into a dustbin, and a mass burial will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft also brought aid and aid items.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance full of dead bodies arrives.”
Healthy water is scarce.
“Everywhere they steal goods from small shops.”
John Golfand of the International Red Cross in Indonesia told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will face there.
It’s sad, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I want you all to work day and night to do the evacuation work well.
“Are you ready for this?” asked CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Indonesia killed more than 550 people.
New Guinea Airlines says a man has gone missing after a plane crashed into a lake.
The airline’s plane, which crashed into a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, says a man has gone missing after it made previous statements that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated.
New Guinea Airlines said on Saturday afternoon that one of the passengers on the flight had gone missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger’s exact information, such as his age and nationality.
The plane crashed into the water after trying to make an emergency landing from the Chowk airport gang, and local boats came to rescue passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events have not yet been determined.
Both the U.S. airline and the Navy said the plane crashed due to the short-haul in the lake.
Some witnesses believe the plane was off the runway.
American traveler Bill Jens said the altitude of the plane was too low at the time of landing.
Jensen said, “That was a good thing.”
Janes said she and others were able to walk on a sinking plane in the water that reached their waistlines and get themselves to emergency exits.
He said the hostess was frightened and yelled, and he had taken a small injury from the head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors near the plane, who were working on repairing the dock, had used a boat to rescue people and had brought people safely to the shore before the plane plunged about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the crashes of Papua-Neuguinea aircraft over the past two decades, but this figure does not include New Guinea Airlines.
The analyst presented the timeline of the night in which the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive ended.
Paul Rolfe, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone reports to put together the work of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tillis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the incident.
According to Clarion Ledger, Roulette said he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed Tillis was with him on the night of Chambers’ death, which contradicted the defendant’s previous claim.
When the information revealed that his phone was with his friend Michelle Sanford when he claimed to have been with Chamiborz, the police went to Sanford for questioning.
Sanford stood in the stands on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if it was true that he was in Sanford’s car that night, he said, “He’s lying because my car was in Nashville that night.”
Another paradox is that Tellis said he had known her for about two weeks when Chambers died.
Mobile reports showed that it had been only a week since they met.
Roulette said that after Chambers' death, Telesis had deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
Hill said, “Talis removed him from his life.”
The final court hearing is scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury on the same day.
OPINION: What is a hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge a negative attitude to this type of music by filling their music with positive messages.
Brad’s groups, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has distanced itself from the principle of expressing political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to bring this style of music back to its original form and make you a conscious hip-hop fan again.
Artists from bands such as Fujiz and Kamen have seen artists such as Akala and Loki recently revive music in the UK.
Another black man?
A New York-based nurse has filed a lawsuit against a couple after they fired him after sending him a “racist” message.
A New York-based nurse has filed a lawsuit against a couple who fired her over racist issues, as she has received the wrong message from the family’s mother, complaining that the nurse is another black person.
The couple denies that they are racist, and compares the complaint to extortion.
When the nurse went to their home for her first day of work in 2016, Lance Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, found that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black and felt anxious.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
However, instead of sending the message to his wife, he sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, Ms. Plasco fired "satisfied" Ms. Morris, saying that their friendly African-American nurse had done a bad thing while her New York Post reported waiting for the Filipino nurse.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day’s work, and was sent home in an online taxi by Uber.
Now, Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple to compensate him for the dismissal, asking for $350 per day for six months, and was hired without a contract to remain at work permanently for a certain period of time.
He told the New York Post on Friday: “I want to show them that they know, that they don’t do things like that, and that I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded in a bad tone to the claims that they were racist, even though they said it was wise to fire him because they thought he could no longer be trusted after being insulted.
“My wife unwittingly sent him a message and had no intention of doing so.
He is not a racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post: “We’re not racist.”
“But are you going to hand your child over to someone you’ve been rude to, even if you’ve done it by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.”
Plasco, similar to the “extortion” complaint, said his wife had two months off to give birth to their child and that she was “in a difficult situation.”
The head of the investment bank added, “Do you want to look for someone like him?
His choice is not good.”
While the complaint is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers have been concerned about readers not communicating with the speaker’s bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “Before the book is published, it’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s going to read it for the first time.
“It’s very interesting to know what we know today about Paddington’s great success.”
He says his father had been a BBC cameraman before he inspired a little toy bear to write for kids, optimistic about his book’s rejection, adding that the 60th anniversary of his father’s death last year was “sweet and bitter.”
He described Paddington as “a very important member of our family,” adding that his father was absolutely proud of his final accomplishment.
He said, “My father was a very quiet man, and he was not self-respecting.”
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it’s like you have a kid who gets something: you’re proud of him, even though you haven’t actually done it.
I think that's how he sees Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was created by him and he was born of his imagination, he always attributed the success of the work to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After her daughter’s fall, she was rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, but the doctors’ efforts to save her were in vain.
Mrs. Edenan-Laprise said that "Nad would call to say that my daughter was really bad, and that she didn't think she could survive."
“Then Nad called me and said he would be gone in two minutes and I had to say good-bye to him.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, baby.”
I'll join you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors had given him to keep his heart alive were beginning to become ineffective and were being removed from his body.
He was dead a few minutes ago, and all his organs were gone.
I just had to sit there and wait and everything would happen to me.
Because I was among other families and people, I couldn’t cry, scream or cry.
I really had to keep my peace.
Eventually, Mrs. Edenann-Laprose, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers—while she had forgotten the tragedy that had befallen her.
He said, “Nobody knew.”
“I had my head down and I was still crying.”
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt sympathy for Nad.
That Nad needed my love and I had to understand him.
I knew how much Nad loved him.
Weeping women put cards on the bridge in an attempt to prevent the suicide of others
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries have put cards on the Welsh Bridge that contain inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want my family to feel the same way I feel every day.”
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Leiden, said her son was a future chef with a beautiful smile.
Everyone knew him with his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates every house.
However, he quit his job before he died, because “his place of work was really dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the first to find his dead body.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m always worried that this will have a bad effect on her.”
Ms. Davis has made the cards, “to tell people there is someone they can ask for help or talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old Mark shortly after her mother’s death.
“Mark didn’t say he felt sad or depressed or something like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
“It was so depressing on Christmas Day that when the kids opened their gifts, they didn’t look at them or anything.”
He said Mark’s death was a huge blow to them, but they had to leave it behind: “It’s going to break the whole family.
His sadness kills us.
But we all have to continue to live and fight hard.”

Brett Cavanaugh's future purge begins with FBI investigation
On Saturday, Mr. Flick said, “I thought, if we could really do what he wants to do – that is, research in limited time, with limited scope – maybe we could reach a little unity,” adding that he was afraid the committee would “spread up” in the midst of a stalemate without going out of the party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to start an investigation?
They are unrelenting because of time.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their efforts to find a man who wants to be elected to the Supreme Court will be severely undermined.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
The Senate votes, with 51 Republican seats and 49 Democrats in the House.
It’s unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can cast his vote and declare him the head of the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim’s rule has been reduced.
A South Korean lawmaker has said the number of North Korean refugees has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bayong-Seong, quoted by the South Korean Unity Ministry, said there were 1,127 cases of refugees last year, down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher wages for human traffickers were among the factors contributing to this.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Most refugees from North Korea are ultimately granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through the Chinese border because China has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross the heavily guarded civilian zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often force them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which continue to be so-called at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore after a comprehensive agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ray Yang-ho, blamed US sanctions on a lack of progress in nuclear talks since then.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ray said: “If we can’t trust the United States, we can’t be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances, we’re not going to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Cavanaugh is “hysterical” and unfit to preside over the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterically” and said she is not “behaviorally fit” to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, Pelosi, in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, made the remarks.
Asked about his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi said: “I can’t say it, I think if a woman did it that way, they would call her ‘hysterical’.”
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted her when she and Christiane Blasey Ford were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was emotional at the beginning of her speech, and when she talked about her family and her high school years, she sometimes almost screamed and screamed.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a “smile and coordinated personality assassination” organized by the liberals because they were nervous about Hillary Clinton’s 2016 election defeat.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was anti-democratic.
“I think Kavanaugh showed by his speech that he does not qualify for the job and shows his incompetence by the way he talks about Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
When Pelosi was asked if Kavanaugh would be elected, and if Democrats would again have a majority of MPs, he would try to prosecute him or not.
“I’m saying this – if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit for the presidency of the Supreme Court or the court he’s currently in.”
Kavanaugh is currently in Washington's court of appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possible opposition votes cast by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Medical Care Act or the law against Wade (a ban on abortion) because he is a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided answering questions at his qualification confirmation hearings on whether he would return some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
Pelosi said: "It's not time for a hysterical and fanatic person to go to court and expect us to say, 'What an interesting thing.'
Women need to manage their tears.
This criticism is bitter and just, months and years of anger, and she can't be left without crying.
Ms Steinem said to me 45 years later, “We cry when we’re nervous.”
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
“The lady who was the manager helped me a lot, and she told me she was crying when she got nervous, but she developed a technique that when she got nervous and she was crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘I’m crying because I’m upset.’”
I am angry.”
And then he continued to do it.
And I thought it was a very good technique.”
Tears are partly meant to shed a sense of anger because tears are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of the most vivid memories I had of my first job in an office where most of the staff were men is that when I cried out to an indescribable fury, the elderly lady took my neck – the mischievous manager I was always a little afraid of – and led me down the stairs.
He said to me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’ve hurt you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democrat in the U.S. Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was spotted on a boat with a stranger named Monkey Business and was dropped from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was so desperate, realized that there was no reason not to run for president herself.
Thirty years later, he laughed and said, “It’s not a decision I’ve thought about.”
“There were seven other candidates in the presidential race, and my nomination was the last thing they wanted.
One person called it the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late for the campaign, and he had no time to raise funds, he vowed not to compete until he had $2 million.
The fight was defeated.
He found out that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men gave him only $250.
He was surprised and thought to himself, “Do they think I’m getting a discount?”
When he began his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was so impressed with the emotions—appreciating the people who supported him, appreciating the system that made it difficult to raise money, making it impossible to find voters instead of delegates, and being angry about gender discrimination—he was voiced by these feelings.
Ms. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to her, “We have a neurological disorder.”
“You thought Clint was my sponsor.”
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
“Did he cry?”
How U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts say the shelling of the start of a trade war between the United States and China has been deafening, and while there is still a long way to the end of the fight, a dispute between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning by imposing tariffs on Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Trade tensions between the two countries peaked this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) of goods, about half of all items imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, with the latest example pointing to tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to compete with the United States step by step, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will be shaken by these winds soon.
Turning Washington back from his decision means surrendering to his demands, but it is too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing is able to play with its cards properly, US trade war pressures could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two countries.
Abigail Grace, a research fellow working in the New American Security Center’s think-tank on Asian issues, said: “The fact that political decision-making without thought by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause economic collapse in any country is far more dangerous than what observers have already acknowledged.”
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria Is ‘Prepared’ to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help from other countries to rebuild what has devastated the war for more than seven years.
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mao was speaking at the UN General Assembly, he said his country’s situation was getting better.
“Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation in Syria has become more stable and secure,” he said.
The government is trying to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and restore normal life to the country.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country due to terrorism and due to unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the conflict in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
“The Syrian regime welcomes aid to rebuild this devastated country,” he said.
But he stressed that he does not want conditional aid, as well as financial assistance from countries supporting the Syrian unrest.
Europe confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team defeated the U.S. team and won the final 16.5-10.5 to win the 2018 Ryder Cup at the National Golf Championship outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Bourne scored the 14.5 they needed to beat the United States, Europe won the championship again.
American star Phil Mickelson, who worked hard most of the race time, hit the ball in his 16th hole in the third shot, admitting his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, an Italian golfer, shined through all phases of the game, becoming one of four players who have played 0-0-5 since the current form of the game began in 1979.
Lower-ranked European team player Torbon Elson from Denmark removed American golfer Jordan Spitt 5&4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 points to England's Ian Puller, who played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, the eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, has always won the European Championships with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t stop crying.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy, I’m so glad we got the cup back.
After the European win, Garcia said excitedly, “It’s the team’s problem, and I’m glad I was able to help.”
He gave an opportunity to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in the singles on Sunday with a score of 2 and 1.
Ram, 23, said, “I’m so proud of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy play.”
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 professional record for the Ryder Cup.
This statistic is surprising to someone who has always been one of the best players and won 14 titles after Jack Nichols.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend trying to find places on the field where Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino would not be, because they played the whole match with all their talent and abilities.
After his disappointing performance, Captain Jim Forrick said, “I’m proud of these players, they fought.”
This morning, we sometimes put pressure on the European team.
We've ruined it.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will come together again, and I will work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cupman Committee and move forward.
“I love these 12 players and I am proud to be the captain.
You have to admire them.
They played better than us.
