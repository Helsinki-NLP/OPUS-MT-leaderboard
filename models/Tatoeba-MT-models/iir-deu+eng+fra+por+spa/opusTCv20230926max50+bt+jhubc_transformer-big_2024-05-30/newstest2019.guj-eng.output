At the international level, China tries to make the yuan an international currency at the same level as the euro, the yen and the pound, including the dollar.
Given the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of converting the deal into rupee and ruble.
NEW DELHI: India and Russia today agreed on the S-400 missile system, amid concerns over US sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is being negotiated between the two countries for the payment of the US dollar.
According to sources, considering the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of converting the deal into rupee and ruble.
The U.S. stopped the trade war with China
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy missiles using the U.S. dollar.
However, over the past few years, China has tried to raise its currency yuan as an international currency against the dollar.
After this initiative, China has been continuously trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, the yen and the pound.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserves of the US dollar in international trade.
China wants to make Yuan an international currency.
The five-billion-dollar mega-defence deal could see the U.S. impose a countering U.S. adversaries three-section (CAATSA).
Last month, the U.S. imposed a ban on the purchase of S-400 missile systems by China.
India and Russia had already started establishing alternative arrangements for this deal.
Earlier, the US ban on the INS Chakra repair deal, which was taken on lease from Russia, had triggered an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
The economic analysts claim that to get out of such a situation, India should exercise the deal using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth mentioning that all the defence deals that India has made with Russia so far have been done through the dollar.
Why did the U.S. Constitution become law?
In August, President Donald Trump approved the Katsa Act in light of Russia's modern defense missile system - a law designed to prevent Russia from acting against U.S. interests internationally.
It is worth noting that the U.S. law was drafted keeping in mind the activities of Russia.
This includes Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
And then there's the thousands of years old mystery that unfolds.
AZAB-GAZAB DESK: This is the story of a Turkish man who made a big discovery while repairing a house.
When the wall of his basement collapsed while repairing it, it collided with a secret door.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a thousand-year-old city hidden inside the ground.
Pictures of this city show how about 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food arrangements.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident took place in 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered the underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed while the house was being repaired.
From here, an underground town called Darinyuku, which is located at a depth of 280 feet, was found.
The size of the 18-storey building was perfect.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with preparations for everything from rooms, coaches, schools, churches, tombs, etc. to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city.
There's a huge barrier to entry for those who want to enter the city.
Each floor can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 AD in order to protect the people of the city from war and natural calamities between the Arabs and the Gentiles.
It's become a tourist attraction:
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other such cities, but this is the largest of them.
Only half of the city can be reached, but this place has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
People come here because of its historical and cultural significance.

Whether Namaz is an integral part of Islam in the mosque or not, today's decision of the Supreme Court
The high court is likely to deliver its verdict on Thursday on the petitions of a Muslim group seeking reconsideration by a larger bench of the Supreme Court on the 1994 verdict on the rights dispute of Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid owner.
The High Court had said that Namaz is not an integral part of Islam in the mosque.
The verdict will be delivered by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer.
He was released on bail on July 20.
Siddiqui, a fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Islam Faruqui.
It is said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddiqui has died and is represented by his legal heir.
Muslim communities have argued before a bench headed by a Ministerial Judge that the decision requires reconsideration by a five-member bench on the observations of the High Court.
Because of its Babri Masjid - Ram Mandir, the land dispute will have an impact on the matter.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the legal representative of Siddiqui, said that the mosque was not an integral part of Islam.
The High Court made the remarks without examining any self-inquiry or considering religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim groups have sought a reconsideration of the remarks about not being an integral part of the mosque and are trying to delay the long-pending Ayodhya temple-mosque land dispute.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, said the dispute has been waiting for a final decision for almost a century.
Rupee hits 71-mark against US dollar
Amid rising crude oil prices, the rupee today plunged by 26 paise to a low of 71 rupees in early trade.
The rupee opened at Rs 70.95 against the dollar in the foreign exchange market yesterday and then moved to Rs 71.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
According to currency traders, a strong demand for US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, a stronger dollar against other major currencies of the world in hopes of increasing trade tensions between China and the United States, had an impact on domestic currency.
The rise in crude oil prices has also affected the rupee due to rising inflation and the withdrawal of the domestic stock market from foreign institutional investors.
At the beginning of the Asian trade, the price of standard British crude rose to $78 a barrel.

On the first day of the mission, the missionaries brought the message to the world.
Sachin Tendulkar was also seen happy from the very beginning of the show.
He also praised the Earth's atmosphere.
He recalled the day when he first saw the earth shaking and said something about it.
About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chavan once asked me to watch the earth shaking.
"This young player wants to meet you and if you can meet him, it will be good," Chavan said.
The man looked at his friend and agreed to meet him.
"He still remembers today that he told his friend that this child will one day play for India," he told the secretary, "he told his friend that you are looking at the future Indian cricketer."
A friend of mine said, "Are you telling the truth?"
"You have to remember my words, this child will play for India.

I've learned a lot about the world, and I've learned a lot from what I've learned.
It's a different thing to have a talent in a player, but what you do with that talent is more important.

I think the Earth shack has the ability to play in different situations according to the game and this is the greatest power on earth.

Did you get a kick out of reading the title?
How can Sultan Mahmud Ghazni of Ghazni, who is the embodiment of the Somnath Temple and a Khalnayak for the common Indian, be a Sanskrit?
In fact, it is clear from the research of Professor Shanta Pandey, a historian at Delhi University, that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
At the time when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask a simple question that Sanskrit was the only language of the so-called superior Brahmins.
Mumbai's Pandit Ghulam Dastgir Birajdar is remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Bijdar, who speaks simple Sanskrit, can also be understood by the rickshaws, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its publication.
The word Holy Qur'an is Sanskrit in his view.
Ku<0x2B>Ran means the sound or teaching heard on the earth of the Apostles.
Not only did he study in a school in Solapur, but today he is one of the great Sanskrit scholars of the country, who is counted as a finger.
However, Pandit ji does not seek to define Sanskrit as a Pandit in the US or other countries to market his life.
The princess of Thailand is the Pandit of Sanskrit.
There is a lot of self-sacrifice in Sanskrit there.
To learn Sanskrit from the United States, students have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
Not only in India, but also in most of the universities other than Banaras Hindu University, the Ph.D. of Sanskrit is also written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati, but remember that education in Takshashila and Nalanda universities was taught only in Sanskrit medium.
Prashanta Pandey has said that Ghazni's Darbari language was not only Sanskrit, he has also noted that his money coins were also inscribed in Sanskrit.
Pande also noted that the coins were inscribed on the "Mahmud Suratran" and that Panini was a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan, the creator of the Sanskrit grammar.
Pandit Nehru, in a huge chapter in "My Hindu Darshan," said that the questionable language of Afghans and Pathans came from Sanskrit in "the strength and durability of Sanskrit language."
Today, it is accepted that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprising aspect of Dr. Ambedkar's rhetoric is that the main architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, and some other Muslims as well as members of the South Indian Constituent Assembly proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the debate on the language of the nation was held in the Constituent Assembly on September 13, 1949, Hindi versus English, among those who proposed the language to Sanskrit were Deputy Foreign Ministers Dr. B.V.Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the National Herald on September 11, 1949, preceding A. The Sanskrit language is estimated to be extinct.
Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to define a national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as the official language, but the national language is not the same.
As per the 2011 Census, Sanskrit is the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country and we have put Sanskrit in a state of shocka.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke at the Constituent Assembly with great respect about Sanskrit.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he has gone to Sanskrit, and scholars of the world have described the importance of Sanskrit: "In the year 1874, Sir Williams Jones said, 'God knows how old the Sanskrit language is, but his creation is wonderful.'
It is fuller than the Greek, more abundant than the Latin, and more subtle than both.
Nehru further notes: "I do not know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, i.e. when it has become a folk language."
At present, the language of swearing-in of members such as Union Minister Smriti Irani as a member of Parliament is only Sanskrit.
We need to revive the culture of Sanskrit and make it a living language.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is important to make an effort instead of trying to make it a symbolic or visual language.
