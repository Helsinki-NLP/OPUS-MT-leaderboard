Welsh AMs Worried About ‘Looking Foolish’
A suggestion in some AMs that their address should be changed to MWPs (Welsh Parliamentarian) is found to be anxiety due to
This confusion arises because the name of the Assembly has been changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Throughout the political scenario, AMs are worried that this may cause their laughter.
A Labour AM said his group is concerned that his voice is mixed with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: twp in Welsh means crazy and pwp means dog.
A Plaid AM said their group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said their group has an "open mind" about the name change, however said there was a short oral jump between the madness from the MWP.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the English letter u of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal draft to introduce the name change, said: "Any speech to be addressed to the members of the Assembly is undoubtedly to be decided by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, showing broad support for the Assembly's right to call the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AMs' address, the Commission has endorsed the Welsh parliamentarians or WMPs, but the MWP has received the most support in public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, however, reaching a consensus for Presiding Officer Alan Jones could be a headache, which is expected to submit a legal draft about the changes within weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules about the incompetence of AMs and the design of the committee system.
During the debate on the legislation, the AMs will give a final vote on the matter on which address they should be called.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of East Macedonia."
Public opinion polls have been held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has named one of its provinces, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor expresses a claim on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its membership efforts in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change, has said he will ignore it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, have argued that the name change is simply the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells went off, while churches in Harlem faced difficulties.
Mr. Adams said that historically every time I spoke to the old people, he would say that there was a church in every corner.
Not both of them today.
He said it was important to get rid of the bugs.
Today, people are being burned in different ways.
The bars are no longer sitting in palaces where people used to go on a regular basis.
As far as churches are concerned, they are concerned that the money earned from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and they will stand where they left off.
He added that the churches could replace condominium-filled apartment buildings that would be filled with people who would not help the rest of the area's places of worship.
He said that the majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white and they will play a role in the early closure of these churches because it is very unlikely that those who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white groups before Harlem became a black metropolis, becoming the metropolitan community of St. Martin in 1870, a decade later.
The original white Methodist group moved in the 1930s;
A group of black people who were praying nearby named the building.
A black group led by Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin, and they led a boycott against juvenile dealers on Harlem's main business street 125th Street for resisting recruiting and growing blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson's church circles planned to rebuild it, they hired Carillon (the bell ringers).
Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called Carillon "the bells of the poor."
In July, a Carillon-playing expert told him something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreversible historical instrument."
Tiffany, an expert at the University of Michigan, mentioned that it was the first Carillon to be played by a black musician, Dionysus A. Lund, who moved to the Great Carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Vader said St. Martin didn't change it.
What has been going on in St. Martin for the past few months is a complex tale of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the general leaders of the church and other bishops.
In July, the Parish's governing body Vestry expressed concerns that the corresponding architects and contractors to whom the link was sent would put the costs on Vestry even though Vestry was not involved in recruiting them.
Some commentators have complained about the lack of transparency.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy for snorkeling fish in California
Government officials said on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving to catch hiking in California.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Innsbruck.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hemel said that at first he thought he was happy to run to catch a dwarf fish, but then he realized he was crying that something had cut me off.
I've cut out something.
Hemel said that when he approached the boy, he found that his entire smiley bone had been opened.
Hemel said he told everyone to get out of the water and said there was a shark in the water.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Roddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is stated to be critical.
The identity of the attacker is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gayles said during a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the boy had sustained injuries in the upper abdomen.
Officials have blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Senitas for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sensbery's plan to enter the UK's Singaporean market
With the staff of Sensbery Split Assistants, the department is offering the products of Boots, Superdrug and Debian Hams with racks in the style of store.
The UK's 2.8-billion-pound made jewellery market, which is still growing while the sales of fashion and home decor items are decreasing, will experiment with larger jewellery racks at 11 stores across the country as part of a notable arrival and if successful, more stores will be added next year.
Investing in Manao Sanghar is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf spaces that were once used for TV, microwave and home decor items.
Sensbury said it would double the size of its make-up stone offerings by adding brands such as Revalon, Ace, Tuzerman and Dr Pao for the first time.
The current offerings of L'Oréal, May Blaine and Britts Bayes will also be given more space by providing specific spaces for the brand as is the case in the bots' stores.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique make-up series so that most of the products are vegetarian-friendly - something that young buyers are more and more demanding.
Moreover, the fragrance retailer The Fringe Shop will also test the discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in South London's Crodon area, while the second store will open later this year in Birmingham's Sealy Oak area.
A change in trend towards buying low daily doses from online shopping and local convenience stores means that supermarkets will have to do more to attract people.
Sensbery's chief executive, Mike Cope, said his outlets would look like more department stores, while Supermarket China is competing with discounted allies and leads with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's also puts outlets for ARGUS in hundreds of its stores and has introduced a number of hobbits since it bought both chains two years ago.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to restructure its manufacturing and pharmacy sectors had failed.
Sensbury had tried a joint venture with Boots in the 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sensbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, China, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, 30 years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the project by offering luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche Puce and Wichi products.
Paul Mills Hooks, Commercial Director at Sensbury, said: "We have changed the shape and feel of our weaving stone racks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have specially invested in specially trained staff who will be able to offer prompt advice.
Our brands have been designed to cater to every need and the attractive look environment and convenience places mean that we have now become an exciting place to offer a made-up jewellery product that challenges the old style of shopping.
Peter Jones 'aggressive' after Holly Willoughby's exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dawn's star Peter Jones TV presenter Holly Wolby is "extremely angry" after her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her life-style brand business and wants to focus on her new deals with Wolby Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There's no time for a brand trolley of clothes and accessories to wear at home with Willoughby.
The couple's business is compared to Gop brand of Gop Paltrow.
The 37-year-old President of Dzh Morning announced his exit from the deal on Instagram.
Holly Woloby said goodbye to Dragon Dunn's star Peter Jones' lucrative lifestyle brand business in the last minute and left him angry.
Sources said Jones was "exasperated" when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Barkinghamshire, on Tuesday that his new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant he wouldn't have time to wear clothes and accessories at Jones's home.
Their business was compared to Gop brand of Gop's Gop's Gop's, and it was thought that Wolby's wealth would double to about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As the 37-year-old Willoughby announced his departure from the trolley on Instagram, Jones immediately left for one of his vacation homes on a ship from the UK.
A source said: "Trolley has been Holly's top priority to a great extent.
This is considered the long-term future in the next two decades.
Everyone was surprised by his decision to leave.
No one knew what was going to happen on Tuesday, but it was the end of the day.
The Marlowe Headquarters has a warehouse full of goods that are ready to sell.
Experts believe that the company could lose millions of pounds due to its massive investment in clothing and apparel products ranging from cushions and candles to the departure of Dus Morning's presidency, one of the UK's most profitable stars, and the possibility of further delays in its launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Don Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Copp, for ten years.
Willoughby established the Troll with the Cup in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple were vacationing together and owned 40% of Jones Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will host Ant-McPartlin at ITV's Show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business affairs.
“We were in love and then we fell in love.”
He criticised himself by the news media for making comments that some people consider "unprecedented" and ridiculed being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have to pay so much attention to it?
Trump said in a mockery of his "news anchor."
"I didn't give up on anything."
He recalled that Kim was interested in a second meeting with him, which Trump described as an important step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament in June.
Negotiations on the use of firearms have been stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea had not seen a "responsible response" from the United States to its initial arms reduction measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump seemed more reactive in his rally speech.
"We're going well with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have become victims.
Our relationships are strong.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing back the remains of U.S. troops.
And they defended their unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be a speaker," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him, "but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, you're seeing about 200 people standing there."
Tsunami in Indonesia, earthquake destroys island, kills hundreds
As a result of the Zalze in Lombok, foreign government organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is the primary stimulus for international aid.
Ms Sumbong said that in many cases, unfortunately, they were quite clear that they would not ask for international aid, which is a little too challenging.
While Save the Children is forming a team to move towards Palo, it is not yet certain that his crew will be allowed to work on the spot.
A spokeswoman for the National Agency for Disaster Reduction said Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Despite the constant threat of earthquakes, the country is not prepared to deal with natural disasters at all.
While Tsunami relief shelters have been built in Ache, they are rarely seen on the beach.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palo is likely to be responsible for the loss of lives.
Even in the best times it is challenging to travel between many Indonesian islands.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
The ship is on its way to Palo, a hospital on the island of Lombok, but it will take at least three days for it to reach a new site of natural disaster.
President Joko Widodo had made his election campaign focussed on improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and he has spent money on roads and railways.
But Joko's administration faces a shortage of funds, while the next election is next year.
Mr. Joko Widodo is also under pressure from growing religious tensions in Indonesia, while some members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
In clashes between the nodes of Christians and Muslims, more than 1,000 people were killed and several Hazaz were left homeless, including khanbars, bows, arrows and other weapons.
Here's a closer look at the Lions vs. Lionel Messi
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Strait saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a score in the 89th.
Stridge received a pass from Harden Shakir about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal when their team was behind zero in a match.
He took the ball first to the left and then shot to the far post.
The ball reached the top right corner of the floating net above the box.
The ball finally fell on Kappa Arsalga and went to the net.
Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com that I was trying to get into this position, that when I reach the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to make the way for myself.
When I saw the fork coming, I only touched the ball once and shot without much thought.
Chelsea got a 0-1 lead in the halftime with a score of 25 minutes by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker turned the ball near the midfield and gave back to Matteo Kovacs with a heel tilt after running in Liverpool's half.
Koch immediately grabbed the ball in the midfield.
He brought the ball back to the box with Hazard in a beautiful way.
Hazard beat the defense by throwing the ball from the top of Liverpool's Allison Baker to the net from the next post.
The Champions League group stage will take place against Liverpool at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stade San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Vidoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's Natural Disaster Reduction Agency said on Sunday that the death toll due to the earthquake and tsunami had reached 832.
The agency's spokesman, Sotopo Provo Nogroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that could cause waves up to 20 feet higher in the ocean on Friday.
The city of Palo, which has a population of more than 380,000, is witnessing debris from collapsed buildings on every side.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the murder of a woman.
A murder investigation was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in the Burkina Faso area of Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 a.m. from Grayson Muse on John Street and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to those who were around John Street in Burkin Head if they saw or heard anything suspicious, contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, if they have captured some dash cam footage please contact us as it may contain the same information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local of Burkina Faso and the body was found inside a prairie.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, while police say they are in the process of informing the woman's close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muse has just tried to enter his flat but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was stunned when he found out about the incident.
Residents are now being told that several hours may pass when the van will be allowed to go back in.
A police officer said the entire area was being treated as a place of worship.
A woman came to the scene of the crash.
She repeated, “It’s so sad.
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lathe while one was parked outside.
A number of officers were inspecting the blocks of hollow flats inside the lace.
Anyone with information is being asked to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 without mentioning the 247 log of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell outside the Parliament is the latest monument to the conflict over ‘resetting history’
Its deportation would be a natural justice for the destruction of the Taliban's style of so much of England's cultural and religious fanaticism that has been at the hands of its insanity and hard-line Jesuit followers.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Cromwell's proposal "unintentional" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
Chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "In the current debate about removing the statues, it was naive that Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Palace of Westminster would be his target.
Cromwell did not order the demolition of the statues of the English Civil War, nor did he do so.
Perhaps in the previous century, the wrong chromewell would be made a sacrifice goat for the actions of his ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hammo Thorne's excellent representation of Cromwell is testimony to the 19th-century opinion and part of the authenticity of a character that many sarcasm think it deserves to be admired.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more so today than in the late 19th century, consider Chromewell to be the man who defends Parliament against the external pressure that undoubtedly was the Kingdom for them.
Is this a valid representation of the ongoing historical debate?
One thing that is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century laid the foundation for the future development of our country, and Cromwell is the individual identifiable personality that represents a part of this division.
His works as Lord Protector are valuable and memorable.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed the farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his family name "Yiwan," was found to have a blood clot in a market in the area of the province of Guizhou.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer in Xinjiang, China's Qanghai province, is preparing to be vaccinated against swine flu.
According to reports, he had come with his cousin from neighbouring Yunus province to sell 15 pigs in the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found the door of the porch nearby opened.
He saw that there was a large male pig in the fence with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig crushed the farmer to death.
Guiang Evening News quoted her cousin "U" as saying that her cousin's legs were bloody and crushed.
The security camera footage showed the yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to graze its pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Ewing News that the pig was locked in a lock so as not to attack others while police were gathering evidence from the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, incidents of attacks on humans by pigs have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and severely injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig hit a Welsh farmer with a tractor but was later dumped by his wife.
When a pig origan farmer was eaten raw in 2012, a mantoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They're just drinking.
They look, they're very curious... they don't hurt you.
You just have to give them the right value.
Heavy rains are expected to continue in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, the typhoon Rosa is weakening as it passes over the frozen waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, there will be torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwest of the US in the coming days.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m., the wind speed of Rosa was 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and its location was 385 miles southwest of Punta Ogunya, Mexico.
It is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tornado is forming over the Pacific and is heading eastwards to the west coast of the United States, while a Baja Californian is heading eastwards on Monday as a hurricane pushes the harbour northwards into the southwest of the United States.
There will be 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, along with the Hurricane Meteor, the coming day will bring heavy rains in the southwestern regions.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flood relays, debris and potentially mudslides in the desert.
Deeper humidity will carry the rainfall rate from 2 to 3 inches per hour at some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Avona.
In some parts of the southwest, especially in most of Avona, there is a possibility of 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Flooding is likely due to the rapidly changing conditions of the nature of rainfall and dispersion.
It would be highly unwise to advise a pedestrian walk in the desert due to the risk of heavy rains.
Heavy rains can turn the waterfalls into angry rivers, and thunderstorms with lightning will cause strong winds and surrounding clouds.
The rising typhoon will bring locally heavy rains in parts of the southern California coast.
Overall, rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can lead to ulceration from dust on roads and roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some scattered rains will start moving towards Awana on the sixth Sunday evening and early morning of Suwannee and will spread further on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains are expected on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperatures can be seen across the United States, while the North Pole cools down, but the Arctic remains warm.
This often results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
The dramatic difference in temperature in Central America on Sunday is a great example of this.
There will be a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Amaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will rise again and expand.
October is likely to be hot in most parts of central and eastern America and temperatures from the southern plains to some parts of the north-east can reach the 80s.
Temperatures in New York City are likely to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows higher than average temperatures in the eastern United States for the first fifteen days of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kanye's hearing.
The Supreme Court's nominee Judge Brett Kenewa and the woman who allegedly accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, were seen on Tuesday by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political tensions are still brewing, and the unpredictable last-minute situation on Friday under which Ashuna's senator Jeff Flake prepared a deal to investigate the allegations by the FBI for a week has interrupted broadcasters in their regular programs.
Ms Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kenia had tried to take off her clothes when she was intoxicated during a high school party.
Kanye said in an emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen's report.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data were not available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, who showed it.
And Nelson usually has a problem with measuring people who see in offices.
From this point of view, his audience size was the size of a play-off match or an academy award.
Nielsen said the Fox News channel, whose participants strongly supported Kenia's appointment, was ahead of all the networks during the entire day's hearing with an average audience of 5.69 million.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nelson said there were 3.1 million viewers of CBS, 2.94 million of NBC, 2.89 million of MSNBC and 2.52 million of CNN.
Interest continued after the hearing.
Flick was the main character in the play on Friday.
After a statement was released from the office of the moderate Republican to vote for Kenia, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him in a condition that protesters were running at him as soon as they tried to climb into an elevator for a hearing of the judicial committee.
It was shown live on CNN that they stood looking down for several minutes while they were being severely criticized.
She said, "I'm standing here with you."
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the people?"
He said, “You have a lot of power, and a lot of power.”
Flick said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator was shut down that he had much more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks were all broadcasting the event live, when the court committee had to vote to send Kenia's nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Flick, however, said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will investigate the allegations against Kenia next week, which minority Democrats have been pushing for.
Flick was convinced after a conversation with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Connors.
After discussions with Conan and several other senators later, Flick made his decision.
Flick's choice was important, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kenya without investigation.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kenya.
British Prime Minister May's critics accuse Brexit of "policy"
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union in an interview with the Sunday Times of "politicizing" Britain's future and harming national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reiterated his criticism of his checkpoints plan for Brexit and said the UK and the EU's proposal to collect each other's tariffs was "completely unlikely."
Vide Sams Shooting: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson for Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, Wade Simms.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and sent to jail for second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms' jaws had been lost during the fighting.
Police arrived at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on him.
After a briefing with Simpson, police said he had admitted to shooting in a lethal manner on the Wade.
The lawyer has reported that his mortgage guarantee has been set at $350,000.
The Coroner's Office of East Baton Rouge Parish released an initial report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck from the head.
The department appreciated the cooperation of the task force, the Crime Lab of the State Police, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area to catch the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police for assisting in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alfa thanked the area's law enforcement agencies for showing "strength in delivering justice."
Sam was 20 years old.
Six feet six were raised in the Forward Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that Tim Wade's death was "injured" and "injured."
"That's what you're always worried about.
Lava rain from volcanic eruptions to Mexico City
Lava, which emerges from the popocatepetl fire, has reached the southern palaces of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano when it quickly began to ignite and recorded 183 gas and soil costs over the course of 24 hours.
The center is monitoring a number of shocks and surge sounds in it.
Images on social media show a layer of dust on the glasses of cars in Mexico City's areas such as Zuchimelco.
Geologists have observed an increase in volcanic activity following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital.
The "Don Goya" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists ahead of Independence Day celebrations
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona following clashes between pro-independence protesters and police on Saturday, with thousands on both sides taking part in demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of separatists, wearing masks, threw eggs and powder paint on the police, covering the streets with a dark cloud of dust where tourists are usually raging.
Later, clashes broke out between the protesters and the police started charging sticks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence knots chanted "no forgetting, no forgiveness" while unionist protesters chanted "Spain Live."
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
The October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid, is still a year after separatist Catalans celebrated it in a free-thinking region.
Voters voted in favour of independence with the dominant majority, if the turnout remained low and opponents of the separation boycotted most of the vote.
About 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling at polling stations in the region during violent clashes, according to Catalan officials.
Pro-independence groups woke up on Friday night to stop a demonstration in favour of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different path.
A 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termis, who was involved in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's chances of achieving independence.
Last year we had some good times.
I saw my parents crying because they were happy, but now we are stuck.
Despite a significant win in regional elections in December last year with fewer margins, Catalan freedom fighters face difficulties in maintaining the movement this year as many of their well-known leaders are either exiled on their own volition or detained for organising a referendum and later declaring independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Poig, who was recording protests in support of police over the phone, said the clash had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
He said the situation is escalating.
After last year's detention, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriole Junqueras, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
He said standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to undermine democratic values and condemn the abuses of the Spanish government.
London: Three people arrested for stealing a car at home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for hitting a car multiple times at a house in London.
The incident took place at Ballingard Crescent at about 19:30 a.m. on Thursday, according to the UK Standard Time.
Detective Bob Bellamings said the gate and the building were damaged.
An arrow was also thrown at the car at some point in the incident.
Menga's goal to win the Lionston Rangers 0-1
The first goal for Dolly Manga's Livingston was a win.
Developed Livingston surprised the Rangers with the win and led to Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's strike was different, while Gary Holt's team remained second with Hybrid.
Gerrard's team is without a win in the opponent's ground in the Premiership this season and will face Harts next Sunday, which he is eight points behind.
Earlier, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston Düsseldorf has taken his victories to six games and head coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
There are fewer chances against the Lionston scouts.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, while his slow pin dealt with all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson did a breakthrough but was able to barely take his effort to the front of the goal, then Alan Lithgrove found himself more wide-eyed before he faced an R-cross header from that Craig Halkett's goal.
The host team was satisfied with allowing Rangers to play with them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble in the set-pieces.
And in this way came the most important bullet.
The Rangers provided a free kick, and Livingston started when Declan and Gallagher faced Malker Menga, who scored from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers' position was dominant, but they found that the host team's defense was invincible and goalkeeper Liam Keely is permanently authorized.
The same pattern continued in the second half, if Jaja Alfredo Morelos received a sequel from Kelly.
Scott Patman was missed by Ranger's goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow shot away from another set play by Livingston.
Livingston's box continued to come up cross-legged and clear with continuity, while only two of the panelists' claims were made - when Halkitt faced the substitute Glenn Middleton and for a handball - which was rejected.
“Unusual” by Livingston – Analysis
Tony Macaroni in the BBC Scotland's Alas der Lamont Arena
An exceptional performance and result for Livingston.
For one person, they were great, who consistently exceeded expectations in this high-end journey.
Their playing style and team members have changed little since returning to their peak flight, but the real reward goes to Holt, who has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halkett remained formidable, offering a very beautifully-arranged defense while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Verall on the claws throughout the game.
However, he was not enthusiastic about the Rangers.
As good as they have been under the leadership of Gerard, they have not been able to meet these standards.
They didn't have control over the ball and could only start once against the hosts - and that's a threat bell for Rangers while they're in the middle on the score table.
A warm welcome to Oregon.
On Saturday (September 29) there was a smile and blue sky when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at fixing ties between NATO allies.
He disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's involvement in the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an later went to Cologne to inaugurate a great new mosque.
The city has the largest number of tourists after Turkey.
Police cited security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the messenger, but several supporters gathered nearby to see his president.
Hundreds of anti-Urdu protesters - most of them Kurdish - also gathered and condemned the German government for Erdogan's policies and welcoming them into the country.
These demonstrations reflect the fact that some German Turks admire Erdogan as a hero, while others see him as an authoritarian ruler.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclists Killed in Car Collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the junction of Bestwood Street and Elway Street on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped the car and the paramedics provided medical assistance, but he died on the spot.
The accident came about a month after another cyclist was killed in a crash that took place on Children's Street about a mile away.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted and people have been advised not to turn to the area.
Long Larton Jail: Six personnel injured in riots
Six prison officials have been injured in a men's high-security prison because of unrest, the press office said.
The unrest occurred at HMP Long Larton in Worcestershire around 09:30 British time on Sunday.
Expert "Tornado" personnel have been called in to control the riots involving eight inmates, who have been isolated in a single wing.
The staff have been treated for minor injuries on the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Larton.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their imprisonment will be increased.
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, have been held in HMP Long Larton.
In June, it was reported that a prisoner was injured in an attack on the jail governor who was treated in a hospital.
In October last year, police were called in to deal with the severe riots, in which staff members were attacked with bullets.
Risk of flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City from Hurricane Rosa (can benefit areas affected by drought)
It's rare to affect a Hurricane Bugatti's wish, but it's quite likely that something like this will happen early next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa will turn to the desert southwest and threaten flooding rails.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued flood warnings for South and East Nevada, Madonna East California and Ottawa including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to take a straight path over Phoenix on Tuesday after arriving with rain on Monday.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said: "Since 1950, only ten cyclones have maintained the status of hurricanes or tornadoes within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that lived within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, while in the Mogollon region of A<0xC5><0x9F>ana, there is a possibility of up to 6 inches of rain at Akka Deca locations.
Other areas of the southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while a total of 4 inches of rain may occur in the Aca Daka place.
Areas that are out of danger of flooding will be blessed with rainy days as the region suffers from drought.
Although the risk of flooding is a serious concern, some rainfall is likely to be useful as the southwestern region suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Uhudna's area suffers from extreme drought, which falls in the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Rosa's route will pass through Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, which retained the strength of the hurricane with a maximum of 85 miles per hour winds on Sunday morning, is moving northwards at a speed of 12 miles per hour and 385 miles south of the Mexican region of Punta Aegonia.
The storm is facing cold waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore its strength is decreasing.
So, on Monday afternoon or evening it is expected to collide with the force of Hurricane Katrina in Mexico.
Heavy rains may occur in parts of Mexico and may pose a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora and somewhere up to 10 inches is also likely.
Rosa will then make its way to the east over Mexico as a hurricane and arrive at the border of Avona as a hurricane on Tuesday morning.
The National Hurricane Center said the major threat expected from Rosa and her remains would be extremely heavy rainfall over Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US desert southwest.
These rains can cause deadly flooding in the deserts and mudslides in the mountainous region.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three youths and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after meeting a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds in Somerset.
A young child was found injured in the Accelerator Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at about 04:00 British time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition is stated to be "stable."
Ivan and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested from the Redstock area at night.
Officials have appealed to people to come forward if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump says Kenyatta endured "community, anger" of the Democratic Party
Trump told a rally in the Whealing area of West Virginia that the vote for Judge Kenia meant a vote to reject the Democratic Party's baseless and shameful tactics.
Trump accused Kenia of "tolerating the complacency and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Keniwa testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied the allegations of Christine Blassey Ford, accusing her of sexually harassing her several decades ago when she was younger.
Ford also testified about his guilt during the trial.
The president claimed on Saturday that “the Americans demonstrated the quality and courage of Kenyans that day.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that a vote to certify Judge Kenia would be a vote for the right of a lawyer with the most competent legal figure of our times and the glorious record of public service.
The president spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, citing Kenya's candidacy.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not participating in it, but I'm actually participating in it.
That's why I go everywhere in favour of great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats are committed to the mission of "obstructing and obstructing."
A senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first important vote in the Senate on Kenia's nomination would take place before Friday.
Earthquake, tsunami kills hundreds of people in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and several skyscrapers were flooded when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slovakia, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday for a fair when waves of up to six metres (18 ft) high hit the beach at sunset and carried people and things on their way.
Tsunami was born after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Sutopo Provo Nogroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's natural disaster response agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta that people were still engaged in their activities on the beach when a tsunami struck the previous day.
Nogrove said the tsunami carried cars, trees, houses, and everything on the ground with it, adding that the tsunami waves crossed the sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to relief centers in Palo.
Images released by the agency show buildings and shops destroyed, collapsed and a mosque submerged in water.
The coastal city is also experiencing earthquakes on Saturday.
The tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Review and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He said that the geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow bay, may have increased the intensity of the tsunami.
The group described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said some bodies had been found decomposed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
He said deaths and damage could be higher in the 300 km (190 miles) coastal area north of Palo, which is called Dongala and is close to the epicenter of the quake.
Nogroho said the communication system was completely destroyed and there were no reports from Dongala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living in the area and that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected area.
He said that it is a tragedy and it can be even more intense.
The agency was severely criticized for not reporting about the tsunami in Palo on Saturday, although officials said the waves came within the time of the warning.
In an unprofessional photo shared on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building is urging people down the street to warn them of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water collided with the beach and swept away buildings and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted the communication system around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to interact in relief activities.
The military has begun sending aid to cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but the victims still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief activities and will remain closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the relief centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While the World Vision crew safely arrives in Palo, where its employees live in shelters built from tarpoles in the courtyard of their offices, they have gone through the scenes of the disaster along the way.
He said many houses were destroyed along the way.
The situation is very bad.
Although aid knots have begun to work hard to transport equipment for relief work, some have complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers are being prevented from traveling to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, equipment and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a natural disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It's not yet.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Olia Aryan, said it was still a province-level disaster.
"Once the government says it's okay, it's a national disaster, we call for international aid, but that status has not yet been given.
After the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, when the second night in Palu fell, friends and relatives of the missing people were praying to Allah to be among the miraculous survivors of their beloved natural disasters.
A child was rescued from the nest last week.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman after she was left with two days of debris while her mother's body was lying near her.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Gandon Sabandanu has trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi said their students were among them.
He stated that as a senior in the paragliding sector, I had my own emotions.
Gandon explained how within hours of the news of Rua Rua's demise spread to the paragliding community, he sent whatsapp messages to players from Palo who attended the beach fair.
One of their messages received a brown mark instead of a blue mark.
This means that their messages are not being delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 during an ATM refill in Livy Newport
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the thief stole $26,750 from a bank employee at an ATM refill in Newport on Friday morning.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release that the driver of the car was preparing to vacate the ATM and put more money into the entertainment complex.
While he was busy with his work, a man "runs behind the Bronx employee" and stole the bag placed for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, but police did not specify the number of people actually involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yes.
Reaper Kanye West is going to change his name.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been known for some time and he has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made ahead of her participation in Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album Yandhi.
He is replacing Ariana Grande in the show, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's owner said.
With the abbreviation of their current professional name, West said earlier that the new word had religious significance for them.
I think 'yes' is the most common word used in the Bible and means 'you' in the Bible, which West said while discussing his album with the radio host Big Boy.
We are you, we are you, and we are you.
It originated from the fountain, which means only one and now it has become Ye - a reflection of our goodness, our glory, our anxiety, and everything else.
The album is also a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who has changed his name.
San Combs is known by different names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Daddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names of Lou and Brother Lou.
A former partner of West, JAY-Z has also used names with and without hyphens and major characters.
Mexico's Armed Forces Will Not Use Military Forces Against Mexicans
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, while the country is moving towards the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez promised to "never use the military against the Mexican people" at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday.
On October 2, 1968, at least 300 people were killed in a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to help young people by offering monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal prosecuting groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments are being made at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, although the U.S. as a whole does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, aiming to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, while all other countries are far behind the United States and we look forward to the next big discovery in AI," Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling funding would double the chances that AI's next major breakthrough is achieved in the United States.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New Global System" was published this month by Hoton Mufflen Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, <0x2B><0x2B>Face.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that overthrew America's highest-ranked Othello player.
Lee praised the technology competition of the previous U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project, the agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next competition would be to identify next-generation visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Li said it's not China, but corporations that are taking the teaching leaders.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. promote its AI efforts.
He said that those holding a PhD in AI should be given a green card automatically.
China's state council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies would give money to US researchers, but the quality of education in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center aimed at engaging partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this year, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a move called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently spends more than $100 million annually on AI research.
For months, the U.S. House of Representatives has not approved the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonian people took part in the referendum on changing the country's name.
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to name the country the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name reflects a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that Macedonia's change of name would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the population.
President George Ivanoff said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of the turnout will be met to verify the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zuran Raif, believe it is the price of entry to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, a country emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to live under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Oliveira Jorgeloska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally necessary, quite a few members of parliament have said they will accept the outcome of the referendum.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of corruption as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
Gosse Tanovsky, a 62-year-old hooter in the capital Skopje, said: "I have come to vote for my children and for making my place in Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zuricha and son Dashko are voting in a referendum on the renaming of the country in the Macedonian city of Strasbourg on September 30, 2018, paving the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Spokane, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawadorkov was preparing a small stage for those boycotting the referendum and drawing chairs in front of the tents.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them by raising our heads, not through the service door.
We are not a poor country, we are a poor country.
If they don't want to include us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zayed says NATO membership will bring the most urgent investment in Macedonia, with the country's unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
After the vote, Zarif said: "I think the overwhelming majority would be in favor because 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO."
"Yes," he said, "it's our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent would participate in the voter turnout - much lower than the desired turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Tilma TV said that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be one vote above 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum would be a serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government that took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling defeated Brighton's defense in a 0-2 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Union Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his score look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
Argentine Stryker received a pass in the midfield at the start of the move.
Before reaching the open field, he left behind three defenders of Brighton.
Aguirre once again found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He tapped a defender and left several others behind at the top of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to the left.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguero with the first lap in the box, who used his right boot to beat Breitton Caper Matthew Ryan and threw the ball to the right of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero had some problems with his feet.
We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to get a shot at it.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues an early lead over the Premier League.
He shot in the 29th minute.
In the game, Aguero got the ball in the Breton area.
He turned his head to the left in a beautiful way.
Sean gave the ball to Sterling on the next post with some tweaks.
Sky Blues' forwards slightly tilted and threw the ball into the net.
On Tuesday, at 12:55, the city will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group play in the city of Hohen-Necker-Irena.
Sherlock wants to play the spinner.
After the Nationals got out of the playoffs competition, there was no major reason for another start.
But the always-on-competitive Scherzer wants to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are play-off implications for the Rockies, who have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won at least one wild card with a 2-5 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get their first Digimon title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we will be able to compete knowing that here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will be playing at the highest level.
Why don't I compete with it?
The Nationals are yet to announce their starter for Sunday, but they are reportedly going to give Sharks a chance to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will take his 34th start, threw out the Bill Penn session on Thursday and is expected to play as usual on Sunday.
Wright Henderson, from Washington, is at 7-18 in this season with 220 2/3 innings with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president referred to the situation with reference to his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Caneva.
What we've done is going to happen in November.
This is one of the most important elections of our time.
"It's a big thing -- I'm not standing in it, but I'm actually participating and that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump continued, "You're looking at this horrible, horrible extremist group of Democrats, you're looking at it happening.
And they are committed to withdrawing power from any means, you see their filth, their wickedness.
They don't care who is harming, and who is crying out for power and control, they just want power and control, and we won't give them these two things.
He said the Democrats were on a mission to “restrain and obstruct”.
He described the Democrats as "aggressive and filthy and nasty and liars" and "you've seen this thing in the last four days."
He cited the name of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking, which led to some voices from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you write the paper?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
She was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad-minded church.
It is not for those whose hearts are hardened.
It's no surprise that the people at my local party voted to condemn me.
Finally, I am the latest addition to the ranks of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not favorites - just because we speak from the heart.
My parliamentary colleague Yuan Ryan also faced a similar attitude because they stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the reconciliation movement drew criticism from me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on similar issues that Jeremy does not agree with former leaders.
The notice for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said, "We want to make the meetings meaningful and recurrent."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of so many meetings has not been the same, and the promise of "mercy and gentleness" politics has been forgotten for a long time, of course, if ever it began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the opposition in the Labour Party is not being tolerated and every opinion is viewed in terms of whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This has happened shortly after Jeremy became the leader, because with me, those I previously believed to have a political point of view like mine, began to expect me to take a U-turn and take a position that I would never otherwise agree with - whether it's national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - no matter what I say - social media starts to rain on sarcasm and criticism and demands for rejection start to fall on me and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments about me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and commitment of these peers who endure abuse on a daily basis on the basis of sexual and racial prejudice but do not give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era's politics is how the levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote the tradition of tolerance.
The fact is that we no longer have that broad-minded church, and with every no-confidence motion or change of election rules the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I've been advised to keep my head down so that if I don't get too clear, then I'll be fine."
I didn't do that in politics.
Since 32 years ago as a school student I have joined the labor force due to the negligence of the Thatcher government that led my Comprehensive School class to come to an end, I have striven for better public service for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was in any way confused about my policy stances and disagreements with the current leadership.
All I can say about the people who made the move on Friday is that while the country is on the brink of Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on proving my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But only one message that I would like to convey to not only the Nottingham Momentum but to the voters of my constituency, whether I am a Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political expediency will stop me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
IR 17 - 38 Milros: Unbeatable IR reached the top
The two delayed attempts could have produced some high bottom in the final result, but there's no doubt that Irr deserved to win in the amazing and frightening match of this tennis premiership.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only team out of ten teams that have not been defeated.
In the end, due to their excellent defense and better chance-take ability, they succeeded, and coach Peter Morchi had a full right to be happy.
So far we have been tested in our game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy.
Rubin Christy of Melrose said: "Ire credited, they took a better chance than we did.
Grant Anderson's effort in the 14th minute, which Frazier Klimo converted into a score, gave Ir a lead, but Scott's captain Rory Hughes got a chance to increase the number of tackles on a yellow card, and Jason Begutt made an effort.
Clemeau consolidated Iyer's lead with a penalty in the perfect half-time. He scored then converted the single effort into a score to score 5-17 in the break.
But Milrods started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was replaced by Bigot,
Roaring knots were delayed for a long time due to a severe injury, and Iyer went further when the game resumed when Stafford McDowell's effort was replaced by Clemo.
Then Iyer's vice-captain Blair McFarlane was shown the yellow card and again Milros took advantage of the extra player's presence, and Bruce Colvin tried which could not be changed.
The host team game returned, however, when Strawson Hutchinson was shown a yellow card on tackling the ballless Clemson, McFarson put the ball into the net on the growing Ir attack.
Before that, Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and gave Gregor Henry his fifth try of hosting.
Searching for a new career in the Starbucks game industry
Steal Game star Ford Carnan is set to move into the hosting industry and has been discovered to be among the directors of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays the role of Jack Javert in the famous BBC show, which he co-wrote and presents with long-time comedy partner Greg Humphrey.
The two have announced that the next nine episodes will be the last of the show and it appears that Karnan is planning to leave forever after Craig Lang.
According to the official record listing, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has refused to comment on the news, although Scottish Sun sources have said that Karnan is concerned about Glasgow's "growing restaurant business."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s Hague court expects reopening of route to the Pacific
In La Paz, the sailors are surfing around a sailing ship's headquarters.
A blue flag is hovering over government buildings.
On the seabed from Lake Teticaca to the Amazon it is written: "Our right over the sea.
"It's our duty to bring it back."
The memory of Chile's loss of coastline in a bloody collision in the 19th in Bolivia is still fresh - as well as the desire to sail across the Pacific.
These aspirations are now at their highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after a five-year trial.
A Bolivian diplomat, Roberto Calzadilla, said Bolivia has a spirit of strength, unity and optimism, and expects results with a positive view.
Many Bolivian citizens will see the ICJ's decision on major screens across the country, with the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile is responsible for negotiating with Bolivia to give an autonomous route to the sea after decades of uneven negotiations.
Bolivia's president, Evo Morales, has also had to do a lot of digging for Monday's decision.
In August, he vowed that his country was very close to returning to the Pacific.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, it won't make a big difference.
The U.N. court in the Netherlands has no authority to extradite Chile's territory, and it has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
"The fact that the ICJ's decision is being made just six months after the last injury was heard shows that the case was "not complicated."
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, it may have hurt it over the past four years.
Zarate said the issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by Bolivia's current administration.
He also said that Morales's controversial rhetoric has also eliminated Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Vultz, who is Bolivia's representative in the Hague, has rejected the notion that the court's decision-making process was exceptionally fast.
He said Monday was an extraordinary opportunity for Bolivia to begin a new era of relations with Chile and end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit.
Callezdilla rejected that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political backing.
He added that Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific.
The decision of the court is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
North Korea: Nuclear disarmament without trust in the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has said his country will never give up on nuclear weapons if it doesn't trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last week.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to resume suspended nuclear diplomacy three months after North Korea's Kim Jong Un met in Singapore.
Ri said it was a skeptical view that the U.S. objection to the continuation of sanctions and the declaration of an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
Washington is cautious about announcing it without taking significant steps in terms of weapons depreciation by Pyongyang.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about reducing weapons that it considers to be the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Showcasing large-sized headscarves at the Paris Fashion Show
If you want to increase the concentration of your heat or stop the sun completely, don't wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie have exhibited large-sized headscarves on the runway for their SS19 collage that sparked the style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
There were a lot of amazing hats on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their great achievements to Catwalk.
Valentino's most prominent was the high-size seed colored hat decorated with wide edges like peaches that covered the tops of the models.
Other large-sized accessories include jewellery watermelon, a magic hat and an ananas-shaped hat - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom also revealed the selection of amazing types of masks - which are being presented on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha.
Many of the colored bengali masks had lip stitches and they looked like Hannibal Lecter rather than modern fashion.
One of them looked like a scuba diving gear with goggles and snorkels, while the other one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the fashion statement - you're lucky.
It is predicted that a large number of such bonuses will become the embellishment of the markets near you.
Large-sized hats "La Bomba" have appeared after hats made of tanks with heads two feet wide and were seen on each head from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The group label behind this highly unsurpassed type of hat that spread across social media has brought yet another major innovation to Catwalk - a beach bag made of tanks that is almost as big as the one worn in a swimsuit model it has to lift.
The orange-colored Rafia bag burning in the Jacuzzi La Rivera SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week was the most prominent with a Rafia flange on the sides and a white leather handle on the top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the arrival of large-sized hats and beach bags in major markets for the next summer - because the designer has left such a huge impact that it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent school maintains a track record of academic excellence, and the record continues in 2018 with outstanding test results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide students and parents with the best level of service possible.
Independent schools prepare their students for the next and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can develop and apply an excellent school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages as a popular and preferred subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes to his head."
If you talk to a person in his or her own language, he or she descends into his or her heart.
It's a strong reminder that we can't rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages in independent schools are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rate.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages earned a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS' 74-member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same status as STEM subjects (Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics) as the choice of subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the U.K. Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons for the difficulty in filling up vacancies were due to a decrease in language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more negligible in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more languages are needed for job opportunities, these skills have become essential in today's world.
Regardless of career choice, if someone has learned another language, having such a life-long skill will be a real benefit in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries makes a multi-tasking person ahead of the competition.
According to the YouGov poll, which surveyed more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of people were unable to speak a foreign language well and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit rate of 15%.
This is why it is important to invest in language education for children today.
Being proficient in many languages, such as developing economies, increases the chances of getting good jobs for children.
Within Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages while others teach the languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a choice of languages in independent schools and there will be a teaching staff with expertise in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that equips and prepares children with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today's global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that languages are very important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and distinction for young people in Scotland.
Good luck to the fairy.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will start playing for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
For fans who want to watch Lee Brown play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in Sunday's pre-season opening match in San Diego.
He didn't know how many minutes he would play.
Walton said on Lakers' website that it would be less than 48 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After the practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plan regarding the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Trump is starting a series of election rallies from the Whealing area of West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week, including a short stop in friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the Supreme Court adjourned by a credible vote on his election to fill the vacancy, Trump is seeking public support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally night and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Whealing, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 pm.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's hearing for his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, who has been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct and has postponed the Senate's verification vote expected for up to a week until the FBI investigation is complete.
However, the main purpose of the rally is to help the Republicans mobilize for the November election.
So, according to Reuters, the Trump campaign's administration said the rallies next week are aimed at "provoking volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to save and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives."
A spokesman for Trump's election campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters: "It's so important for the president's agenda to keep control of Congress that he will visit as many states as possible while we're on our way to a busy interstate season."
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally scheduled in the Wesbanco Arena in Whaling "will bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive quorum from the Pittsburgh media."
This will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia last month, where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for St. Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Hyder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said it was not a good sign for Mauritius that the president had to come to the polls.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA's determination to compete to retain hopes of going into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the rider's cup was the same as the couple's on Saturday afternoon.
The amount of movement of the swinging pendulum is entirely an invented game concept, but a concept in which players believe heartily, and will never have been as much as in competitions like these.
Then they will say, "Where is the movement now?"
"He had a six-point lead and now has four, so I think we're taking it as a bit of a move.
Of course, Europe has a lead, with four points ahead while they can try to get twelve more.
As Spieth said, Americans feel that their senses are slightly restored right now and they have enough to be hopeful about, such as in the case of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each scored four to three points.
Spieth has been deadly with regards to putting the ball in the hole and he has set an example.
As their round continued, the fans' screams were getting louder as they put the ball in the hole with a lighter hitter and made their name from four to four matches - at a time when Thomas and they were behind by two points after two points.
When his golfer won the match on the 15th, he also cheered fans' screams, in a way that tells you that he thinks the U.S. team hasn't been out of the competition yet.
Spieth says you just have to work hard and worry about it for your match.
The only thing is that each of these players is now gone.
There are 18 streets left.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, a Muslim tale of the Ryder Cup.
The European team is amazing, but the desired pair is perfect and they don't expect to make a mistake.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a single boogie on Saturday afternoon, but they saved the boogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and then again on Friday morning.
The race and the way in which their energy moves from and to the crowd of these stormy spectators reinforces the belief that they are the only players to be conquered on Sunday and that there will be no popular player other than Flatwoods or Mulanari who can ensure the European team's possible victory when the sun sets.
preferably both on different holes together.
The beauty of Europe is still there.
Boba Watson and Webb Simpson immediately finished the work of Forbes' heroes when his pair was with Alex Norrin.
In the first nine holes, a bogie and two doubles dropped the Spanish and Swedish pair into a hole from which they could never get close to getting out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of the hole.
The interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy changes in a moment are great to watch for morning four balls and afternoon four symphonies.
So far, the European team has shown a good game as a team and maintained its dominance until the last day, but this Forbes session has shown that the team is also keen to compete in the USA, which some people have been skeptical of as a particular state side.
Europe's lead of 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
The last day of the European Ryder Cup will appear with a clear lead after gaining a 10-6 lead in four balls and four semis matches on Saturday over the United States.
The passionate duo of Tommy Flattwood and Francisco Molinari began with two victories over the conflict-ridden Tiger Woods and has so far taken their telephony to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Byron's European team, which has been trying to maintain its trophy lost in Hazelton two years ago, overtook the U.S. team in the morning Forbes competition and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. was more resilient in the Forrests competition and won two matches, but could not meet the loss.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Flatwood is the first stopper (new recruited) of the European team to win four points in a row while their pairing with Molinari, known as "Mollywood," is the first pair in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend, which earned four points in its opening four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four Balls, they defeated together the defeated Woods and American Rocky Bryson DeChambeau by a much stronger 5&4 lead.
Woods, who barely managed to score in two matches on Saturday, showed his stature but lost 19 of his 29 four-ball and four-sams games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning Four Balls competition, returned to assist Heinrich Stenson in the Four Sams, and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Quipka - whose world rankings are first and third - 2&1.
The European team could not have wished for a pleasant and windy day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time major championship winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won a 2&1 victory over Spain's John Rham and Ain Polter in the Four Balls, and later defeated Polter and McIlroy in the 4&3 after losing two opening holes in the Four Sams.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has been able to return to the game after a four-point loss while going into the singles, although Furyck's team only needed to equal the match to retain the trophy.
After remaining in second place for two days, however, it appears that the retaliatory attack on Sunday will be out of their reach.
North Korea says it is "unilaterally unarmed" without building trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was undermining his country's confidence in the United States, and that there was no question in such circumstances that his country unilaterally withdrew from its nuclear arsenal.
Ri Yong-ho told the World Health Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, eliminating the site of nuclear tests, and committing to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said: "We don't see any reaction from the United States.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not be unilaterally armed first.
While Ree reiterated North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-step" nuclear disarmament strategy, his statement appears to be significant in that he did not reject the unilateral disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued after the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim vowed to make efforts toward "clearing the Korean region with nuclear weapons" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
The United States has also called for tougher international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "first-mild nuclear weapons" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to forcibly achieve its goal, and is even objecting to a "declaration of war."
The notion that restrictions can force us to kneel is a crude notion of people who don't know about us.
The problem, however, is that the continuation of the restrictions is increasing the distrust.
Ray made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president had previously highlighted at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister specifically mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the South had been a party to the nuclear disarmament issue, the United States would not have created such a disarmament cessation in the Korean region."
Nevertheless, Ree's tone of speech was dramatically different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that Kim had become a fugitive to targeting U.S. soil with North Korean rockets after Trump described him as a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, lauded the UN's move to reduce nuclear weapons this year, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear arsenal.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a timeframe for it, no matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia argue that Pyongyang should be compensated for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with intensity and without interruption until we achieve the goal of a full, final and verified denuclearization of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ree on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made but only a few hours later North Korea had condemned him for making "gun-like demands."
North Korea has promised to dismantle a missile-making facility and a nuclear complex in a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "reasonable measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "responsible measures" he wanted included security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course to get a good amount of sleep
Harvard University has encouraged all its undergraduate students to get more sleep this year under a new course to combat the growing masculinity tradition through "all night awakening" with the help of caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's first-ranked university are often unaware when it comes to the most basic things like how to take care of yourself.
Charles Cessler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Barry Groom & Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
After making a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on the reading process, they were motivated to start this course.
He said, “I’ve got a girl coming up to me and saying, ‘Why am I being told this when I’m in my senior year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - a fact that surprised me.
This course, which is launched this year for the first time, explains to students how good sleeping habits help in academic and sports performance as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Brera, a professor of mental disorders at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive toxins.
A section consists of a picture of the hostel room, in which students click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive images encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
Paul Cessler added, "We know that this will not immediately change the attitude of the students."
However, we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about its effects on health when choosing to smoke.
He said the tradition of being proud of "wake up all night" still exists and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said making sure you get enough sleep should be the students' 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety - even to avoid obesity, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student who is studying chemical and biological biology, has helped Professor Paul Ceciler develop a course he took last year during his first year at Harvard.
She said the course opened her eyes and created an ambition to try to start the course throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to complete the same type of educational program before all post-graduate students join the competitive institution.
Dr. Seussler recommends that students should consider setting up an alarm when to go to bed and when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of electromagnetic screens and the 'blue light' emanating from LED light.
A Zero-Winning at Livingston Rangers: Menga beat Gerard's players by goal
Another shock to the Rangers came when a dolly manga hit Steven Gerrard's unbeaten team by a goal compared to zero in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking to record their first win after a 4-1 win in February at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team imposed his second defeat on Gerrard as manager in 18 games and kept his team away from the acquisition of Ledbrox Premiership Leaders Harts by just eight points.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of half time and the enthusiastic Rangers team could never beat him.
While the Rangers are now at number six, Livingston has jumped to number three and is only behind Hybrid by a goal difference.
There could be more trouble for Gerard when he was hit in the head by throwing something from the other end on the lineman Colom Spencer.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, leading him to the semi-finals of the Irbatford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livi 11 that gave him a point from last week's Hurts and he would have been pleased with the way his turnaround at every turn reduced the opponent's tail.
The Rangers may have been dominant, but Livingston kept the ball under his control.
They would have scored within just two minutes of the start of the game when Scott Patman gave the ball to Alan McGregor's goal because of Menga's first dismissal, but the midfielder saved time.
By the time Kegan Jacobs reached the free kick captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only throw the ball to the back post.
The Rangers certainly gained control of the game, but could only hope for confidence in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he received a penalty on the fourth hour mark when a collision between him and Steven Lalis took place, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed Colombia's appeals.
The Rangers could only shoot two shots at the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former goalkeeper of Ibrox, did not face any major trouble with the header of Lassa Colaballi and Ovie Azaria's weak shot.
While Levi's opener in the 34th minute could have been against the game's blow, no one can deny that it was their first need.
Once again, the Rangers failed to tackle Jacobs' tricks.
Scott Arfield did not find a timely response when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson and he chose Manga to finish his move with a cool temper.
In the break, Gerard exchanged Ryan Kent in place of Colby, and the change showed an almost immediate effect when the winger gave the ball to Morelos, but the influencer Kelly ran from his line in time to stop him.
But Livingston continued to force guests to play the game of their choice, when Lithgow and Halkit took longer shots at each other.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final round when Lithgow threw to head Jacobs from the corner, but McGregor came in the way and thwarted their attempt.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed a penalty kick when he was confused with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it.
Title: The Age of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, counting, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany on September 30, 1882.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which was an invention that eventually led to a device called the Geiger Counter.
It has since been the biggest support not only of science but also of pop culture, as seen in the 1950 movie "Bills of Coronado" in which seemingly unlikely Guillaume Scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are actors:
Person: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
"When you put these airphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radiation-producing atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, it's really poppin' up!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention attributed to his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine system can train immune cells to ‘look’
Cancer's new vaccine system can train immune cells to "look" and kill them.
This vaccine helps the immune system to identify stray cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from a patient and turning them into a lab.
Then they can ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers, and then these cells are re-entered into the body.
The vaccine has shown promising results in different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine had breast cancer in her abdomen for more than 18 months, a vaccine that trains her immune system to identify displaced cells.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from a patient, turning them into labs so that they can "see" the common proteins found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-enter those cells into the body.
J. Berzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we now have a highly promising vaccine.
Professor Berzowski clarified that HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer" including breast, uterine, lung and gastrointestinal cancers.
A similar strategy of taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has also been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his SNL performance, congratulates Trump on wearing a MAGA hat
It's not good to do that!
His outspoken performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would fight for the re-election of the president in 2020, after fans expressed dissatisfaction with Kanye West during the Saturday Night Live show in the studio.
That night, after presenting his third song, Ghost Town, in which he wore a great hat to make America great, he shouted slogans against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can we like Trump, he's racist?'"
He said, "Yes, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago."
The SNL began the show with a scuffle with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony against the claim of sexual harassment made by Christine Blassey Ford against her in front of the Court Committee of St. Brett Cavanaugh.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's Herze Sarai was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock wants to ridicule the West through this posting.
In addition, West complained to fans that he had to face a difficult time behind the stage because of his hat.
"They beat me up on the stage.
“Don’t go on stage with that hat.”
They've threatened me!
"According to the Washington Examiner, he told me then that he told me I was in a kneeling position."
West added: "Do you want to see the kneeling place?" he added, "He'll keep wearing his superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love."
The Verity magazine reported that the fans expressed their displeasure at least twice because of his comments and that the SNL actor was looking upset.
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper McMillan died a few days ago.
West was confused by his song "I love her" dressed like a parrot bottle.
West was backed by Candice Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "Salut to one of the most enthusiastic souls: Thank you for fighting the mob."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply expressing his personality, and that's absolutely amazing.
"However, I have chosen not to reward a person (by buying his music, or his clothing, or by supporting his "feeling") who I think has had such an idea of his own and of the future that is detrimental to my community.
he is free.
"We are free," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following in the footsteps of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Puffy Daddy.
The fellow rapper Snoop Dogg's name was Snoop Line, and undoubtedly the former legendary Prince of Music had changed his name to a symbol.
Man charged with attempted murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Bali.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star cut Harrington's poisonous masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his sword-lifting role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, sharply criticized the heroic strip tradition of displaying masculinity, saying that showing such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel they have to be tougher to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kat said he understood "something went wrong" and questioned how to combat the issue of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kate, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Lizzie, 31, admitted that she was serious enough to address the issue.
He said: "I'm personally quite serious about where we've gone wrong in promoting masculinity.
What have we been teaching men as they were growing up, with regard to the problem we are seeing now?
Kit understands that television can be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine roles.
They said, “Is there any thing that has been created and taught?”
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, makes boys feel that they have to adopt a certain attitude to be male.
I think that's a big question of our time - how do we change this trend?
"There is something wrong with the training of young men."
He also admitted in the interview that when the Game of Thrones series comes to an end next summer, he won't be doing any more of that kind of series because he's "trapped by battlefields and horses."
From November, Cutt is a film producer and his brother who will appear in a remake of Sam Shepherd's film True West, based on the story of a thief.
The actor recently expressed the fact that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is one of the best gifts he's ever received from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife at the show, so she gave me my future family and a new life beyond that.
Rose played the role of Jon Snow's sweetheart Agaret in the conceptual series that received the Emmy Award.
She got married in June 2018 on the grounds of Lizzie's family Jagger in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials said more than 820,000 people were affected by the disease in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were affected by sexual intercourse, which is contrary to the tradition of the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions.
However, at a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese medical officials said that the number of people infected with HIV in this way has come down to almost zero.
However, the number of cases of HIV and AIDS in China has reached 100,000 over the years.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
In China, homosexuality was declared an inviolable act in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to still be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of these infections are due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
To address this issue, the Chinese government has promised to provide comprehensive access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP Senator data, strongly condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations that a member of her staff published personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insisted that such claims were being made by "extremely right-wing pundits" and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: "It's all lies, lies and more lies."
The information allegedly released includes the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham and Mike Lee of Ottawa and Oren Hatch's homes from South Carolina.
The information appeared online on Thursday, which was published during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavano by an unknown person in Capitol Hill.
The information was leaked shortly after the senators objected to Kavanaugh.
Hill reported conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and Red State reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the posts were linked to the Waters office, and also released information on a member of Waters staff.
Waters added that this baseless accusation is completely false and an open lie.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and protection is threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and openly false.
Waters' statement was immediately criticised online, including former White House press secretary Eric Fletcher.
Fletcher wrote that this is outrageous.
It shows that she doesn't have the guts to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They don't have to work in a vacuum.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm and quiet."
Flasher Waters's response seemed to be compared to the criticism of Democrats by Judge Kevano, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said: "It's great news.
In a statement, Waters said his office had alerted law enforcement agencies and other authorities regarding these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that responsible people are brought to the scene and held legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - The Untold Story of Atkinson
It has now become a tradition to see the importance of Brexit in any British perspective new film, but this does not justify the revival of Johnny English's action comedy The Evil Emmys franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to show that we have a clear vision of how this new generation is going to be?
In any case, the disqualified Johnny English with eyes outstretched and rubber-faced had a license to refresh things for the second time - and that his gesture is a broader comic creation designed for non-English cinema-going areas than anything else.
He is undoubtedly a mad secret agent who, despite his oddly textured remarks, has a little bit of Klassico's character inside, Mr. Bean's Sean and the man who offers only one head of the theme song of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His role is actually based on the traveler and interlocutor of Atkinson, who once appeared in Barclay Card's TV commercials and left behind chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest JE outing.
I liked the idea of riding a horse in the middle of the night and riding a bike in the middle of the night.
Atkinson's skill for physical comedy is on display, but in comedy he is not John and looks oddly textured, especially the "significant" film brand such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now presenting humor with self-confidence as a component.
The humor feels like it's for younger children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's cynical movements aren't as sophisticated and sophisticated as Atkinson's silent motions in Ben's character.
The real problem is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has penetrated the highly secretive web network of spies and is revealing the identities of all British agents in the field.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is a weak-willed figure of greatness, who is already in complete political disrepute. Emma Thompson bestows the role of this partial Theresa May, but the script doesn't have much of a soul.
Their intelligence advisers inform that because every active spy is at risk, they will have to bring in a retired person.
And that means exposing Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a disguised area, but offers off-the-record lessons about being a spy: in some places it becomes difficult to stop laughter because Johnny runs a school of rock type academies.
Johnny is brought to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-term partner, Bough, whose role Ben Miller is playing.
Bo is now a married man, sub-marine commander, the role of a Julie Hockey Sticks in which Wikipedia is a bit of a nuisance.
So in the Queen's Secret Service, the action returns to Batman and Ruben's style, in which Olga Kurilenko faces Jabin Ophelia Boltofa.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously runs the magic of a tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: Manish Jason Volta, whose role is played by Jack Lacy.
Joni and Bo begin their story with their funny colored ribbons; in the breeze of the waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxurious boat and create chaos by smuggling themselves; and Joni tries to recreate the English twain al-Malloki when he is introduced to the interior of Volta's house.
All the breaks have been saved for this last series, of course, but as exciting and stormy as this game is, the whole movie makes it look like you're watching children's TV.
There is plenty of medium-sized material.
And as with other English films, I'm always forced to wonder if the British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that can do justice to his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that it is planning to work four days a week for UK residents, but to take five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay for five days.
According to reports, the party wants the company's bosses to give their workers an extra day off and pass on the savings earned through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers.
Under this, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend - but home pay will be paid as much as before.
Sources said the concept would be a "museum" for the party's economic agendas and projects that want to stifle the country in favour of workers.
The four-day week of transfer trades has been approved by the Union Congress to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but the Four-Day Car Week is a movement that is suitable for the party's overall industrial strategy in addition to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such a notion, but instead promised a four-day weekcare in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not endorsing this notion.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day weekend is not the party's policy and is not under consideration by the party.
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of bringing a socialist revolution to the economy.
Mr. MacDonald said he was committed to withdrawing power from "non-faced directors" and "neoconservatives" in utility firms.
The opposition's chancellor also means that existing shareholders in water companies will not be able to get their full share back because the Labour government could "cut down" due to misconceptions.
He also confirmed plans to set up a content-owning fund to include workers on the company's boards and hand over 10% of private sector firms to employees, earning workers an annual turnover of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation against Kevin will change his mind
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavano has delayed at least a week in a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court and raises questions about whether the Bureau's investigation would force any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Peale asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI would find something that would persuade them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more baffling than he did with South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course (it could be).
I went to the courthouse and talked to the judge.
After the accusations came out, I called Kevin and said, "What did you do?"
He was determined, conjectured, and two toes in his position.
However, I did not see any resilience in Graham's intentions.
He said his opinion about Brett Cavanaugh is irreconcilable and that dynamite should be blamed for changing it.
With Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has strongly denied it.
No one can confirm his name.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any major change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival in which many famous singers demonstrate their art and are equally influential is its mission; the eradication of global poverty.
In its seventh year, several thousand people at the Global Citizen Festival will gather at the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the singing of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to create awareness about her real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, launched in 2012, is an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively working against poverty.
For a free ticket to this fair (if you want to pay for a VIP ticket is a separate thing) concert fans have to complete some task or "explosion," such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful action to create awareness about the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has the global citizen been in achieving his goal while there are only 12 years left?
Is the idea of offering free concerts to people a real way of persuading people to demand action, or is there another form of ‘climaticism’, in which people understand that they are doing a great job by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded 19 million "fires" from its supporters since 2011 in support of the demands of various targets.
It says the actions have prompted global leaders to announce more than $37 billion in pledges and policies that will improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements generated by its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds received directly affected about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and enforcers in the UK that is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" after receiving 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
Tracy Almin, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018 that with the help of the British government, the Maoists, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a story of the past.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 demands from the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, to benefit 5 million women and children in need of nutrition.
In response to a question on your website, "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It's a long and difficult journey - sometimes we'll fall and fail."
But, like the civil rights movements and the anti-racism movements, we succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Some of the performers at this year's event in New York include Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Genele Mona.
U.S. could use its navy to block Russian energy exports - Home Minister
U.S. Interim Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as Washington Examiner reported, that Washington "uses its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, if necessary."
Zanke has accused Russia of trying to find new energy markets in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.
"I understand that their presence in the Middle East is due to energy congestion as they are doing in Eastern Europe, which is the southern belly of Europe.
They have the means and the means to deal with it.
He said the United States has the capability through its navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and if necessary, to close them so that their energy does not reach the market.
Zinke was speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategy of dealing with Russia and Iran, and effectively has a stake in them.
Referring to Russia as "a tricky horse" whose economy relies on fossil fuels, he said the economic option for Iran and Russia is to rely more or less on fuel and replace it.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is committed to a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, a more affordable option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unwritten competition.
After meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, "I think energy should not be used as a means of increasing pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
Germany has strongly criticized the U.S. position and reiterated its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry body, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I feel very sad when a third country is disrupting our energy supply.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider carefully" to run for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "consider carefully" her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in the Massachusetts area of Holocaust, Warren confirmed he would consider taking part in the election.
"It's time for women to turn to Washington and fix our broken government and need a woman in power.
He said that he will be seriously considering his fight for the presidency after November 6.
Warren stormed President Donald Trump during the Town Hall and said, "They're taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, have been heavily criticised.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that Warren's own constituency had a majority opinion that he should not take part in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Sophocles University's Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters said they should not take part in the election.
Twenty-five percent voted in favor of taking part in the election.
The survey showed more support for the participation of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the possible participation and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that are being talked about to take part in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Twenty-six-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
He told a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that after coming from the conditions my son is going through, I can feel the grief of other families who suffer from PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers come back.
Palin called his arrest "the uncontrollable elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war soldiers, "They come back a little bit differently, they come back a little harder, they come back to think about whether what they, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military do for the country, is appreciated or not."
According to a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department, Trackplan was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence, reporting domestic violence, and possession of weapons in a state of intoxication.
18 states, D.C. support to challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter people fleeing bullying or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a petition on Friday (Amicos Curie) with the court to support the refugee policy challenge in Washington.
The Grace v. Sessions case, filed by the American Civil Rights Union in August against federal policy, did not reveal the full name of the defendant.
She said her partner and "son-in-law of her violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the state, which supports Greece, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as the countries that produce the largest number of U.S. asylum seekers because they face major problems of gang-rape and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum is against the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals' decision to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Riesen said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
The petition, in collaboration with the court, stated that federal law requires that all claims of asylum be judged on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and that the policy is a violation of this principle.
In the petition, the lawyers further argued that the immigrant-blocking policy is detrimental to the U.S. economy because such individuals could become caravans and "provide essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to give more shelter to those fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11 that asylum would only be available to those who leave their home country because of fear or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum-seeking has never meant reducing all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Efforts are underway to double the number of victims.
The situation was more critical for the survivors.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kosoma, was in a fever-stricken care facility in the city of Palo, where her son died.
Every minute an ambulance is carrying the bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Locals have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, trying to pick up the stuff that had been submerged in the water and what had been left behind.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital, which was hit by the 7.5-magnitude quake, was filled with some of the injured.
Some of the injured, including Harith, who had a fracture in his waist and shoulder, were resting outside the Palo Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to earthquake tremors.
Tears began to flow from his eyes when he shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
He didn't have time to save himself.
Harith told the Associated Press that he had been pressed into the debris of the walls, adding that he had come to the town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then the silence was covered.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they'll be safe.
US ambassador accuses China of 'exploding' through 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's daily supplements in the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper Des Moins Register, after China accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US election.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a new phase in Washington's growing campaign of increasing pressure on China, as U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it's normal for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, a fierce trade war is brewing between Beijing and Washington in which they have announced several rounds of tariffs on each other's exports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's response to the outbreak of the trade war was aimed at exporters in states that supported Trump's Republican Party, such as Iowa.
Terry Brinstad, a former long-term U.S. ambassador to China and a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Brenstad wrote in a column in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is increasing the threat by running propaganda ads in our free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press by advertising in the Des Moines Register.
Contrary to this, you will hear limited voices against the government on the newsstands in the streets of China and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's views on China's worrisome economic policy, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers had scoffed at his offer to share the article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts have warned Republicans are distracting women voters ahead of mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh case.
As many Republicans are defending Brett Lee, the nominee for the Supreme Court, against several charges of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that she will face her reaction in the coming midterm elections, especially by women.
Emotions are much higher than ever before, and most Republicans have publicly indicated they want an opinion on the matter.
Grant Reiher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday that you can't ignore these things.
Riher said he was not convinced that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s demand for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to convince angry voters.
Karen Jean-Pierre, the national spokesperson and senior adviser for the progressive group Moo-on, said women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November.
Mac reported that while protesting in the Senate's basement on Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" the demonstration took place after Republicans who controlled the judicial committee decided to continue Kiwano's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
An independent political analyst, Stuttgart, told the news site that the Democratic sentiment and the movement would be unpredictable.
People say it's too high and it's true.
But these feelings can rise even higher, especially among swing female voters and young voters in suburbs, aged between 18 and 29, who often don't vote for it because they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he detailed allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court's nominee judge, analysts suggested that it would have a strong reaction if Republicans decide to continue the confirmation vote.
Earlier last week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said it had become a boon for the GOP.
Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the selection of Democrats, told the news channel that the problem is not just the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kevano is included in the bench, but also how Republicans dealt with the issue and what they did with it (Kristen).
However, after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, it seems that the Americans are in awe of who to believe, while the latter has little advantage.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 people believed Ford's testimony to be certain or perhaps true, while 35% said they believed Kevin's testimony to be true or perhaps true.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kevano lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reported that after Flick's request, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, besides Ford.
Ford made a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kevano abused her at the age of 17 in a drunken state.
Ramirez alleged that a judge named for the Supreme Court revealed his shyness to him during a party in Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet compared to Google and Facebook
The founder of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is planning to launch a new internet service compared to Google, Amazon and Facebook.
Technology Legend's latest project Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to know where their data is stored and which information people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "global dominance".
He said: "We have to do it now.
This is a historical moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
This includes a list of contacts, a list of tasks to do, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that the user has the authority to decide what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring together resources, procedures, and appropriate skills to make solids available to everyone.
The company currently consists of a community of on-the-job developers and volunteer coders on contracts to work on a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are "conversing with Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full-fledged change in which all business models will be disrupted overnight."
"We're not asking for permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee changed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added that he is extremely optimistic about this next era of the web.
Bernard Vaughan: A tribute to the priest who won the Victorian Cross in World War I
The ceremony was held in his hometown to commemorate the 100 years since the only Church of England to win the Victorian Cross during World War I.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the attack on Bellingdale and Leahcourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a raid and he never knew that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
On Saturday, two of her grandchildren in the Northamptonshire area of Rushden unveiled a memorial stone during a parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the stone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane took his battalion across the De Saint Quentin River "in very deep fog and in very intense firing from the field and machine guns."
Later he quickly moved to the firing line and led his line forward with "greatest courage" by driving a field gun alone and before dropping three detachments.
Lt. Col. Vane was assassinated by a German raid on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's accomplishments were something he could never fulfill, but was a humble national service.
After the parade, he and his brother, Dr. James Vane, led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he feels honoured to participate in the parade and "the courage of a real hero is being demonstrated with the support of many."
MMA fans wake up to see Bellator 206, instead they get a Pappu Pig
Imagine that you wake up all night to see a turtle something full of Bellator 206 just because you're missing out on the main event.
There were 13 competitions on the San Jose ticket, including six on the main card, which were being shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6 a.m., as Gagaard Mossasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when Cowridge turned into a pimp.
Some of the people who woke up in the morning were unimpressed.
One of the fans on Twitter called the move to children's carts "a kind of nonsense joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said it was the government's rule that such content was not suitable for 6 a.m. and had to be moved to a children's program.
"Papa the Pig" Yes.
Scott Cooker, the president of Belatore, said he was working on his schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
Cooker said, "I think when we think about the replay, I think we might be able to solve it."
But there are six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to broadcast it on Sunday, Monday according to our time.
But we are working on it.
Be sure that when these changes were made, a lot of text messages were being received and not all of them were friendly.
We are trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical error.
But that was not the government's problem.
I promise that won't happen.
We'll be focusing on five competitions instead of six - as we normally do. We tried to make the fans more entertaining and we couldn't do it.
This is a disappointing situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt 'less' due to his sexuality
Olympic diva Tom Daly says his sexuality grew up with a sense of being waisted - but that inspired him to become a successful person.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking at Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, Lauren Laverne said she spoke about gay rights "to give hope" to others.
He said that being a father, he had become careless about winning the Olympics.
Christy Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a runner in Lauryn's first show, Daley said she grew up with the feeling that she was "less than everyone else" because the thing wasn't socially acceptable for boys and girls.
To this day, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different has given me the strength and ability to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove he was "something" because he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has appealed to more countries at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to end homosexuality.
He said he's openly speaking because he feels lucky to have been able to live a normal life without consequences and wants to "hope" others.
The three-time world champion said it was "surprising" for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar-winning Dustin, who is 20 years older than him, last year but the age difference has never been an issue.
She said that at such a young age when you had to go through so many things - she went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and three years later her father died of cancer - she said it was difficult to find someone of her age who had seen such highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Daily reported that he changed the perspective about his life.
He said, "If you had talked to me last year, I would have talked about winning a gold medal.
Did you know that there are more things than winning an Olympic gold medal?
It's my Olympic gold medal.
His son is named after his real father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said he didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and the last thing he asked was whether he got a ticket for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, "I didn't find them saying, 'Daddy, you can't live to sit in the next row.'
I held his hand when he took his last breath and I was with him until he took his last breath and I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
All I knew was that for this I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of the home crowd at an Olympic Games.
He also created the motivation for selecting his first song - Proud by Heather Smal - which resonated in his mind while preparing for the Olympics and still makes his rounds stand.
The Desert Island Disc is aired on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 British Time on Sunday.
McMillan was added to the Rider's Cup on Saturday.
U.S. Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to restore his form to avoid setting an unhappy milestone.
McLuhan, who is playing for the 12th time in the competition after every six months which is a record, has been added by Captain Jim Furk for Four Balls and Four Sims on Saturday.
Instead of being the focus of people's attention, often what he has been for America, five-time major championship winner McLaughlin divided his day into playing the role of a chair leader and working on his game to overcome his weaknesses.
He can never throw a straight ball at the peak of his career, so he is not suited for the 48-year-old Le Golf National course, where his long-running grounds are severely punished for wrong shots.
And although the course itself may not be so difficult, McLean will face British Open champion Francisco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has won all his four matches this week with Rocky Tommy Flatwood.
If Americans who are at a loss of four points at the start of 12 singles matches start enthusiastically, McLaughlin's match could be really important.
Favrec expressed confidence in his player.
"He understands his role well today, kicked me in the back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow.
He has full confidence in himself.
He is popular and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I had imagined more than that, but what was supposed to happen happened and maybe that's what we thought.
Like any other player, he wants to be on the field.
He will break the record for playing Nick Faldo's most rider cup match by playing on Sunday.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, but it has nothing to do with his individual record highs.
McLaughlin has scored 18 successes, 20 failures, and seven equal scores (halves), although Faulk said his presence gave a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he is humorous, sarcastic, charismatic, likes to flirt with people and is the soul of the team room.
I think the youngsters enjoyed it with him and it was a great week too.
It gives a lot more than the game.
European captain Thomas Byrne knows the big lead could soon be over
European captain Thomas Byrne knows from his experience that a fairly large lead in the Ryder Cup's final day singles matches can easily turn into trouble.
The Danish player began his career in 1997 at Waldrama, where a team in the captaincy of Sev Balestros overtook the Americans by five points, but when they reached the finish line, they won by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 with a very narrow margin.
"You're reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valdrama, we had a big lead in Brockline, where we were defeated and we lived in Valdrama, but with very little margin.
So the story told me and everyone in the team that the matter is not over yet.
Today we go to the field tomorrow with full preparation.
Go there and do everything right.
It doesn't end until you get a point on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to win this trophy, and all our focus is on it.
I've always said that I focus on 12 players on my side, but we're well aware that our competition on the other hand is with the best players in the world.
Happy with the performance of my players on a tough golf course, Bayern added; I never rushed into it.
We'll have a different call tomorrow.
Tomorrow there will be individual performances that will be outstanding, and that's a different thing to do.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when the conditions are favorable, but when you're there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that you have to fully prepare the players and take advantage of their full potential.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and show his full potential.
Compared to Byron, the opposite number Jim Furk expects his players to perform better individually than the pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who picked up three of the four points.
Fiorque himself remained on both ends of these unexpected big changes of the last day, after being part of the winning team in the Brockline he faced defeat when the European team won the "Mediterranean's honor".
When asked how Captain Karnshaw took his players to the last day in 1999, he replied, "I remember every word of it."
Tomorrow we will have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get to this quick start as you saw in the Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When she keeps the amount of movement on one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
"We're going to put our players on the line and put them in such a way that tomorrow we'll show some kind of magic.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the counter-attack and will compete with Rory McLaughlin in the top match and with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rham, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Polter and other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I put my players in this order because I think it covers the whole game.
Germany's new warship was once again postponed.
The German Navy's new frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace Cold War-era ships, but it won't be until at least next year.
A military spokesman was quoted as saying that the commissioning of the first ever new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, the Rhineland Falls, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery woes have put the Ovalal Project at a loss.
Four of the Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that a powerful topology will be installed on these ships, along with various types of aircraft destroyers and ship destroyers, as well as secret information technologies such as radar radar, infrared and sound equipment.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance - it is possible to deploy the latest frigates away from your native port for up to two years.
However, Dietz pointed out that the continued delays in these modern warships will leave them before they enter service, which is said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength across the seas.
The less fortunate F125 frigate came to head last year when the German Navy refused to formally commission the ship and sent it back to Bloom & Wassup Yard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but German media cited "a number of serious defects of software and hardware" that would have made the warship ineffective if it had been deployed on a Hurricane mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class planes had to be operated by only 120 sailors' crew - about half of the manpower available on the old Bremen class ships.
It was also revealed that the ship weighed too much which reduced its performance and limited its ability to add future upgrades for the Navy.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Remainland Falls weighs twice as much as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, has also become a problem.
Its cost is said to have risen from the initial 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
The importance of the problems faced by the new frigates is increasing in light of the recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, Hans Peter Buttls, acknowledged that the Navy was lacking in ships capable of being deployed.
The official said that the problem has become serious over time, as the old ships have been cleared but new ships have not been provided in place of them.
He regretted that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
Research on the secret life of bats by the National Trust
A new study conducted in a cave in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use natural landscapes to find food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these flying mammals in a unique way and provide guidance for future conservation activities.
The research study, conducted by scientists at the Inverness Gardens in Wester Ross by the National Trust for Scotland, includes common and supernatant papyrus trillies, as well as brown long-eared and daubant bats.
Special records will be kept at key locations throughout the area to track bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will conduct a mobile survey using manual detectors.
The expert voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what types of calls are being made.
A detailed map and report will then be prepared to produce a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Duver, natural conservation adviser for NTS, expressed hope that the results would show which areas of the zazzle boom are most important for bats and how they are used for all types of bats.
This information will help to determine the administrative functions of the Zad Boom, such as setting up green spaces for bats and related species and the benefits of retaining forests.
Bat populations have declined significantly over the past century across Scotland and the United Kingdom.
Their populations are threatened by construction and development work that affects their ashlands and zodiac booms.
In addition to wind turbines and lights, some chemical components of flypaper and building materials and pet cat attacks also pose a threat to them.
The squirrels aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch a prey.
She uses a reliable eco-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in her flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 37 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the ashrams, and carry out relief operations.
The organization is Scotland's first and only bat shelter in the Threave State in Dumfries and Galloway, with eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
State manager David Thompson said the state is a better place for them.
He said that there is a wonderful place for bats here in Threave.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good native boom.
But there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we're doing here or elsewhere will help us understand what's needed to grow them.
He stressed that it is important to detect bats before starting maintenance work in buildings because it is possible that destroying a maternity nest could kill up to 400 females and children, possibly a full-fledged local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, threaten or hurt them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Farrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
They said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many species, we don't even know what is going on with their populations.
Ronaldo's allegations of sexual misconduct are denied, while lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of sexual assault "fake news" and said people want to use his name to make him famous.
Her lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
An American woman, Katherine May Yurga, has claimed that she was raped by a Portuguese proselytizer in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo is accused of paying Katherine $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Hours after the claim was reported, speaking to its 142 million followers via Instagram Live Radio, the 33-year-old Ronald Reagan dismissed the reports as "false news".
He said, "No, no, no.
The five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or said in front of the camera that what he was saying was "false news."
They want to use my name.
This is a normal thing.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's what happens in such actions.
He smiled and said, "I'm a happy man and everything is going well."
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel in connection with the allegations, which he described as "unacceptable reporting of suspicious things in the sphere of private life."
"Ronaldo will claim to have been harmed in accordance with the serious nature of the offense, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years," he said.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Mei Yurga allegedly went back to the Players' Room, where he allegedly sexually abused her on the way to the anal.
Yorga claimed that Ronaldo sat on his knees in front of him after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but had been defeated by "one percent evil."
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that he had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayurga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to settle out of court because she was "fearful of retaliation" and was "disturbed by public humiliation."
The 34-year-old Mei Yurga says she wants to end the settlement because she is in a constant trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was due to leave Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and move to Italian club Juve this summer with a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK employers will “always regret” privatisation
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "always regret" if it lost its position as a global leader in the post-Brexit manufacturing sector.
He added that it is "interesting" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
Mr. Clarke said we need a deal.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of a Brexit without a deal, the impact of border delays would affect jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars, produced about 150,000 cars last year, with the remaining 90% being exported to the European Union.
Maron Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston, said: "My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will have production breaks.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how to trade across borders.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its own money plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Carmakers say most of the concerns in the event of a no-deal Brexit are related to the risks of the supply chain.
Toyota's production line runs on a "timely delivery" basis, with parts arriving from suppliers from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption on the border, which could delay or reduce the supply of parts.
The company says it will be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day's worth of goods at its Derbyshire plant, so production will have to be stopped.
Mr Clarke said the checkpoints plan for the future relationship of Theresa May with the EU was "designed to avoid these cross-border inspections."
He told BBC Radio 4's two-day programme: "We want a great deal that will make us successful in the current situation but take full advantage of this opportunity."
The testimony of not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we have to be able to fully continue our highly successful supply chain.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that long-term increases in costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately affect jobs.
Peter Saussures, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the United Union Convener at the plant, said he was very upset with it: In my experience, when these jobs are over, I never get back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a sound and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed for another week" while the dispute over the Supreme Court's nominee Judge Brett Cavano is still ongoing.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible impeachment of the president.
Whether or not Trump would sack the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Mueller's sovereignty has been a subject of gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of using the tool to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Roosevelt denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House despite reports of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not prefer to remove Rosenstein, but then a meeting of the Senate's geodesic committee to avoid confrontation was postponed, in which Kavanaugh and another woman, Dr. Christine Ford, who had accused him of sexual misconduct, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set for it, it could be this week, with other things going on in the Supreme Court, I see it's going to be a week later.
But we will keep an eye on it and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters will reject the claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
"While the lack of briefings was not due to the dislike of T-Reporters, I will not deny the fact that they think so," Sanders said.
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without giving any reference, he said, "Presidents have the most questions and answers from themselves than the previous president: we have seen their numbers."
"There will still be briefings, but if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it's certainly much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We do our best to do this, and you've seen us do this in the last few weeks, and when you talk to the president of the United States, it will replace the press briefing.
Trump regularly asks questions when leaving the White House or attending a press conference with open sessions or dignitaries.
The single-player game is very rare.
In New York this week, the president probably pointed out the reason for the violation of the rules and sometimes the presence of a different kind of gathering before reporters.
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to the EU workers about the fear of Brexit in the NHS Scotland.
The Health Secretary has written to the staff of the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and wish to remain in the post-Brexit position.
Jean Freeman MSP has written a letter less than six months after Britain's exit from the European Union.
Scotland's government has pledged to meet the cost of housing applications of EU citizens already working in developed public services.
In the letter, Mr Freeman wrote: "There are ongoing discussions between the UK and the EU in the summer, which is expected to be decided this fall.
But the British government is also making preparations to deal with any possible inconsistencies.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the role of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
The European Union and its far-flung partners bring in invaluable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and you want to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had to undergo an emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee's Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie suffered a head injury during Saturday's match against Vanderbilt Commodore and then underwent emergency surgery after a 27-31 defeat.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury took place shortly before halftime.
"He came to one side and fainted there," Red said.
Trainers and medical personnel put Abercrombie on the stretcher and put him on the sidelines before being taken back for further inspection.
An official from the state of Tennessee told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's surgery was performed at the vendor's Built Medical Center.
Harris added, "There are currently no details available about the nature/heavyness of the injury," and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Ebercrombie, who is a junior, is playing his first season with the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he made a total of five tackles that make up the total number of his tackles in the season 18.
There will be more stamp duty on foreign buyers buying property in the UK.
Overseas buyers will be charged more stamp duty on property purchases in the UK, with additional money to be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This move will disable the success of attracting young voters of Carbon Drive.
The stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects to receive <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that it has been decided to impose more stamp duty on foreigners buying property in the UK - with the extra money to be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as undermining the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to provide more affordable home bars and target more earners with the oath.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and entities who are not paying taxes in the UK, with the additional money being used to promote the government's campaign against gold.
Surcharge, which is an increase in current stamp duty, including higher levels that were introduced two years ago on purchases to pay for another home and rent - can be charged up to 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to generate <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
About 13 percent of new properties built in London are bought by non-British people, making it difficult for first-time homebuyers to step on the buying ladder.
Many areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "both towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just two weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land and not using it to keep property prices high, and Ms. May expressed a desire to eliminate quotas on cheap homes to get rid of "home-battery" in the UK.
Mr. Carbine has announced a series of attractive proposed reforms, including rent controls and "constructive reductions."
They also want to give councils more powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to the restoration of the British Dream - this life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and live a free life.
However, it may not be as easy for them as it is for those who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies to buy homes like hard-working British citizens.
For many people, being a homeowner has become just a dream, and the subdued dream has become a reality."
Jack Russo: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland."
Sunderland owner Jack Russo says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott is going through the challenge of resuscitating 42 Northeastern clubs, which are still three points less than the first position in the league one.
They went to the Summer Stadium of Light this summer after last season's St. Mirren took to the Scottish Premiership.
"I want to play for my country.
I was given a B-cap and a bus," Russia told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But Scotland grew up watching with their father on Hampden, and that's what has pulled me back.
But this is only possible if I'm successful in my career."
Russia's predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poit and Paulo de Keno.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he had no fear in following such famous names in such a big club after being rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success on this occasion will be measured by ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’
"Obviously, in terms of the structure and facilities of this club, its place is in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him there, but I will consider myself successful here only if I can take the club back there."
After 15 months as an assistant boss and coaching staff at Hearts in Dumbarton, Russia has only had three years in its management career.
Then they saved Alva from coming out and helped her recover to the third grade, and next year saved St. Mary's from coming out and being one of the champion title winners.
And Russia says they feel more relaxed now than their playing careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academy.
Recalling Alva's handling of the charge, he said, "It was a gap in the real sense.
I really thought the game was better than the game."
It's weird because I played fine, earned a lot of name and money and also enjoyed a high quality life to some extent.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things you need to do on a weekly basis.
As far as mental stress and pressure in terms of work, I still face them, but I find management appropriate.
I've always wanted to be an administrator and now that I've been doing this, as much as my life has been in puberty, I think it's more comfortable than my whole life.

One survey found that the best time to drink a pint of beer included 5:30.
The summer heat wave has increased sales of British low-flow pubs, but has also increased pressure on restaurants.
Statistics show that sales of pubs and bar groups saw a 2.7% increase in July - but its sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA's Business Consulting, who collects the data, said: "Continuously sunbathing and longer participation in the World Cup, contrary to England's expectations, meant that the series last month saw pub sales rise by 2.8 per cent, except for the fact that restaurant sales dropped more than that.
In June, the restaurant business declined by 1.8 percent, worsening in July.
If compared to the sale of restaurants, as far as the sale of restaurants went down, there are wine-drinking pubs and bars that have been successful so far.
Food pubs were also affected by the sun, but not as much as restaurant operators were affected.
Some people just want to drink.
Equally managed pubs and bars' sales rose by 6.6% this month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, Regional Sales Manager, Luxury and Hospitality Analyst, said: "These findings continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
As far as sales in the outdoor market are concerned, the impact of weather and major social or sporting events is the biggest factor.
Despite a 4.8 per cent year-on-year decline in sales, it's no surprise that restaurant groups are still facing difficulties and this will be particularly troubling due to the ongoing price pressure.
There was no worse time for long hot summers to come for food-driven operators, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures seen in August will provide the necessary rest.
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in trends towards brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker observes the sales of the British pubs, bars, and restaurant sector industry and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry's recognized benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents.
One survey found that one in five children - up to the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "central" account to show their parents.
One in five children - including 11-year-olds - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a sharp rise in "fake Insta" accounts - a photo-sharing site with reference to Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students said they had a clean "central" account to show their parents, while also had private accounts.
A mother has secretly searched the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, revealing a young girl who was wishing for others to "exaggerate" with her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of autonomous schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting they will keep their private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Bacon said: "It's disturbing that so many young people are creating online accounts where their parents and teachers can't find them.
The Scottish Athletics Board will have the "Voice of Athletes"
Eli Duel has been elected as a non-executive member during the annual general meeting of administrative affairs at Scottish Athletics.
Dual has the most outstanding track record in Scotland and Field Athlete and Chairman Ain Beatty sees the move as a great opportunity for sports leaders who want to take advantage of their extensive international experience in the past decade.
"Ellie has a lot of respect in the Scottish, British and around the world athletics community and we are confident that her board of directors will be very useful for athletics in Scotland," Beatty said.
"I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can help and play my part in guiding the sport in Scotland," he said.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m race with his other four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a temporary stroke attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
It was a very patient effort, but I've fully recovered and learned how to walk again, and today I'm doing recreational exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
The announcement of the breast pump, in which mothers were compared to buffaloes, has distributed online opinions.
An advertisement from a breast pump company distributed online reviews that compared the milk cows to nursing mothers.
For the launch of the "World's First Wearable Silent Breast Pump," user technology company Elvie has surprisingly released a music video ad to show the freedom that the new pump mothers give.
The four real mothers are dancing to a song in a box full of buffaloes with the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk my own but you won't see any tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my breasts."
The song continues: "Get her out, get her out, I'm gonna put her out, get her out, get her out, I'm gonna milk her."
However, the ad that appeared on the Facebook page has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video has faced mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it is highlighting the "bad effects" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use buffaloes to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant to produce milk and have a baby, except that their babies are stolen from them just a few days after birth," a woman wrote.
The alveolar pump fits right inside the nursing facility (alveolar/mother).
Another commented: "Obviously painful for the baby and the mother.
"But why don't they use them to advertise a breast pump for the mothers who keep their babies with them?"
Another added: "It's a very sad state of affairs.
Others defended the ad, in which a woman admitted that she found the song "joking".
"I think it's a sexual fantasy.
If I could still drink milk, I would buy it.
It makes me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it as its purpose.
One wrote, "It's an intelligent product."
Another commented: "This is a humorous ad that targets mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and they feel like their own "cow."
This ad is not about defining the dairy industry or establishing an opinion about it.
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that she was dancing by pumping in her brazier.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their breasts look like their own cows.
However, the Elvi pump is absolutely noisy, has no wires, and fits carefully inside the nursing brazier that also enables women to move, hold their babies, and go out when pumping.
Anna Blairn, a partner at Mother (Mother), and ECD, commented: "Elvi Pump is such a revolutionary product that it needed a fearless and active launch.
We wanted to highlight the challenges of breast pumping and all of its challenges by paralleling the women and dairy buffaloes doing so, while expressing it in a fun and relevant way to create the wonderful sense of freedom that this new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvi has come to the headlines.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children wearing the product came on Kate Walk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of refugees have quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detainees has increased, although the monthly crossing rate has remained relatively the same, partly due to the policies and narratives introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are self-documented immigrants and fear that their ability to live in the country by claiming a child will also be jeopardized.
The threat escalated in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and adult members of their family would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official working at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor underage children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of these collections are illegally settled in the country who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So, we will investigate these individuals," said Mr. Albans.
According to asylum activists, authorities are introducing new rules for children wanting to be processed as soon as possible, requiring some of them to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days of detention.
Many of these will be presented through video conference calls rather than self-proclaimed to follow the legality case before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered disqualified for release will be deported immediately.
According to reports from asylum workers and systems in recent months, the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to be upset or upset, which could be a precursor to violent protests or attempts to escalate.
Lawyers said the protections were even higher in major centers such as Tornillo, where large volumes are more likely to ignore symptoms such as children's problems.
He added that moving to a tent city without giving children the right time to prepare emotionally or without saying goodbye to friends can cause trauma, which is already causing a lot of children to suffer.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "communist forces" to leave immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
The teacher, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
He said: "They should be released immediately.
The teacher insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, which has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy war against both terrorist groups and an illegal foreign presence" until we clear all Syrian territories from them.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Syrian Arabs and Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 ground troops in France's war-torn country.
On the issue of Syrian refugees, the teacher said the conditions were appropriate for their return, accusing "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that have kept the refugees away.
"We have sought help from the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be based on humanity as a whole."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until an agreement is reached between Bashar al-Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a bufferzone at the previous central rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity to put more pressure on political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has halted an attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a three-million-populated province.
The teacher, however, stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and hoped that military action would target jihadists, including the Nazrul Front, which "will be dismantled."
The U.S. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is expected to hold a meeting of the new committee soon, including government and opposition members, to draft a post-war Syria constitution and pave the way for elections.
The teacher clarified the Syrian government's conditions for joining the committee, saying the panel's work should be "restricted to the review of the current constitution" and refrain from interference.
Trump will win the second term.
In this sense, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, provided that the accountants and scandals overturn his presidency in advance, as many liberal viewers hope.
It's definitely going to be the most exciting finale!
So far, there are no signs of anxiety.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's have tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has secured the first position in cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers in the main news nights.

Of course, apart from anything on television, the story coming from Washington, Roe v. Wade, whether migrant families can reunite and determine the future of the global economy's health.
It is a luxury and only the most deserving viewers can afford it.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you see a six-hour panel of experts using a "deep background" for Bob Wood Words's book "Fear," Paul Menafort's $15,000 cashmere headman's bomber jacket (also discusses details on Keanu Reeves's "Bodyless Clothes") and Stormy Dee.
As one of them, I will never see Super Mario like before.
Brent Montgomery, the chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, is part of the Trump show's ever-changing cast and what he's been doing, and part of the day-to-day routine that he's been doing, as he says, "fighting with N.F.L., buying, praising Kim Jong-un."

When I arrived at Mr. Flynn this month, the weather was 80 degrees warm outside his home on the north coast of Koi, but he was watching MSNBC recording CNN sitting inside the house.
They couldn't keep themselves away, and not at all when Brett Kavanaugh has to face the Senate's geodesic committee and the future of the Supreme Court is shaking on that balance.
Mr. Flynn told me, "I remember when we did those great shows all day long and people were saying, 'These are the beginnings of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it might be some kind of joke, but it turned out they were telling the truth."

It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election is witnessing a flurry of money, thanks to the re-alignment of congressional districts that has brought in two new candidates for the same seat.
This was recently won by Pitts Democrat Representative Connor Lamb, a semi-urban Pittsburgh district representative - who won a special election in another district last spring.
Lamb is fighting another Republican representative, Keith Rothfuss, who is now representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is quite dominant as the new 17th district.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in January, which said the old districts were unconstitutionally closed to benefit Republicans.
In the new 17th district, the race has sparked a financial battle between the party's financial aides, the Democratic Campanile Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campanile Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been owned by a Republican for nearly a decade, and President Donald Trump won from the district with 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China and then withdrew from it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing after some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama even as his partner ousted Trump's organization's management team.
Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials "decided to call the U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan."
But the sentences were reserved only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid for drug control, development and economic support in 2017.
The proposed punishments, including financial aid cuts and targeted visa-focused restrictions, could be painful for the Central American country and its rising unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a key step in efforts to prevent refugees from entering the United States last year.
But by mid-September, senior management officials made it clear they wanted progress in the conference that would effectively eliminate any penalty protections for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is being criticized for addressing a conference in mid-October as a sign of a change in management positions at the gathering.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without further harsher messages or punishments from the United States.
A White House spokeswoman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the debate, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, had described as ready to discuss an internal debate on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were verified by an external analyst who was close to the administration and he also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next thing that could happen is a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible hurdle in Mr. Trump's path to justice, which is now in the public record with clear evidence.
Mr. Miller is now reportedly turning his investigation to see if Trump's campaign was in line with Russia's attack on our election.
If Congress changes its seal, Mr. Trump will be held accountable at the institution before the voter, and most likely face the death of his colleagues.
There are many, if not many, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's departure is final - at least not as much as his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make some choices that will decide how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, if only the West had opposed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich, German officers would have been ready to carry out an organized rebellion against Hitler.
We failed and missed a chance to escape the next years of the massacre.
The path of history depends on such changing points, and the inevitable journey of democracy is either fast or late on its basis.
The United States now faces a number of such decisions.
What will we do if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Road Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since the newspaper reported that Mr. Rosenstein proposed secret recordings of the president and indicated that he was unfit for office, he has been in trouble.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is wrong.
"What if Brett Kavanaugh's investigation of the newly requested F.B.I. is not complete or fair - or if the Supreme Court confirms it despite substantive evidence and false testimony of sexual assault?"
And above all, what if we vote for Congress in the middle term that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will suffer a long hard winter.
But because of the lessons I've learned in Prague, I'm sure we won't fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported by the same Nazi government to Auschwitz, which at one time occupied my diplomatic home.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles at Swastika's table.
With such a legacy, why can't I have hope for the future?"

Graham Dorns of the Rangers is hoping ahead of the Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that despite the victory against Austria and the draw against Valerial in Spain earlier this month, they will keep them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorens from presenting his first game of the season even as Villarreal was afraid of 2-2, however, he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for future brilliant results.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
We went into the match with the confidence that we could get something and we got a point.
Maybe we could have finalized it in the end, but overall the draw was a decent result.
They were probably better in the first half and we proved to be better and better competitors in the second half.
There's another big game on Saturday.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they have got a good result in their last match but since the support of the fans will be with us, I hope we can move forward and get a positive result.
"Last year was really tough and whatever happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now I have a good feeling about the place.
The squad is good and the players are really enjoying it; the training is also very good.
Hopefully, we can move forward and succeed by putting the last season behind us.
Women can't sleep on their own.
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how to take care of them, very few people were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of the survey respondents said they had been discussing long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family that takes care of them, but they're not stepping in to discuss it," said Holly Sander, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
We have to start from here.
Talk to your children and spouse: If you do not inform your family of your wishes ahead of time, you may not be ready to provide care for your family.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss how to receive care, as these options can be a significant factor in cost determination.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with ways to pay for these expenses.
Your money resources for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to cover these costs, or personal insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Take out your legal documents: Stop the legal battles.
Get health care support so that you can hand over your medical care to a trusted person and make sure that if you are unable to communicate, the professional will comply with your wishes.
In addition, you should also be aware of your financial decisions.
If you are disabled, you will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure the payment of your bills.
Don't forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, with the death toll expected to rise.
No reports have been received from rescuers in the Dong Gala area, which is located north of Palo, near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the storm struck.
Below are some basic information about the Palo and Donggala suspended on the island of Solovisi:
Palo is the capital of Central Solvesi Province, located on the shores of the narrow bay on the west of Solvesi Island and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is an area of more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) northwest of the island of Solovisi.
Regency Province is an administrative district with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the Central Sulawesi province is mainly dependent on fishing and farming, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in the Moro Valley, a coastal area opposite Sola Visi.
According to the Indonesian Hurricane Relief Agency, Palo and Dong Gala have been affected by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, there was a tsunami in Western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific color of the earthquake's fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
2004: A tsunami in Indonesia's northern Sumatra province on December 26 triggered another tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom died in Asia.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that later hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the capital city of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing nearly 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pedy Jaya region in Asia, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed as a result of the collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of tourists in a state of panic.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been arrested on charges of attacking Trek Palin.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, the 29-year-old from Wassail, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she snatched her phone from him.
KTUU has reported that Palin has been remanded to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and detained on an undisclosed bond of $500.
According to the network report, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about his plea, he declared himself "absolutely not guilty."
Palin faces three grade A shortfalls, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with grade B deficiencies, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been levelled against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic assaults, tampering with reports of domestic violence, and possession of weapons with poisoning in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had accused him of punching him in the face.
In 2016, ex-military groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which escalated after her services in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Solavissy on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems have been disrupted and the death rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near Central Solavissy, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the earthquake are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for the Palo City Main Beach Festival.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty against the suspect in the New York City terror attack.
In New York, federal prosecutors have called for the death penalty against the suspect in the terror attacks in New York, Sephora Cipov, who killed eight people -- an occasional death sentence that has not been pronounced in the state against any federal crime since 1953.
30-year-old Cippo allegedly used a home depot truck to hit the cyclists' path along the western side of the highway in Lower Manhattan and crushed pedestrians and cyclists on their way.
As a justification for the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sepoy "arbitrarily" targeted eight people and "arbitrarily" caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court documents, both of these offences are punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Sepoy with 22 charges, including 8 charges of murder for organized exploitation of Balzbar, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and one charge of violence and vandalism.
Prosecutors described Sepoy's attack as "horrible, cruel and thoughtful," saying the attack required "ample planning and thoughtfulness."
"Sifulo Habibullah Evch Sepoy has lost Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann Larry DeKat, Darren Drake, Earl Earl Earl Earl, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendez and the family and friends of Alejandro Damián Pagnucho," the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade of executions in New York's southern district.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution of a federal trial in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War and later executed.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by lightning on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sepoy, a Uzbek citizen, has not expressed any regrets in the coming days and months of the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about his actions.
According to the allegations, Sepoy told authorities that he was impressed by watching ISIS videos on his phone for the attack.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
22 On the charges, he found himself innocent.
David Patton, a federal public prosecutor representing Sepoy, said he was "really disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think asking for the death penalty rather than life in prison, which is unlikely to be released, would be a long-term mental trauma for everyone involved," he said.
Sepoy's defense team had earlier told prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
The Tory parliament has said that Nigel Farage should be made in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage suggested mobilizing the public army during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UCAP leader said the politicians were "failed" by EU opponents - when a member of the House of Representatives of Theresa May proposed that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU herself.
Conservative Peter Bonn, a former senator in Birmingham, said in March that had he been the Brexit secretary, Britain would have “been out of the EU by now.”
But Ms. May has trouble persuading members of her various positions, which opponents of Brexit are highlighting in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
Despite the attacks by supporters, opponents and the European Union, the prime minister is trying to keep his checkers compromise plan in the right direction.
The allies insisted that they would try to advance the deal with Germany despite strong reactions - and force EU opponents and workers to choose from their packages and 'inspired'.
Mr. Boone said that leaving meant a Leo rally in Soli Hill through which he wanted to "force the checkers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be shared and responsible for negotiations with Germany.
He said: "If he had been in charge, Britain would have left the European Union by now.
Wellingborough MP added: "I am a supporter of Brexit but we have to force the checkers."
Speaking about his opposition to the European Union, he said: ‘We do not fight to condemn World Wars.
We want to make laws in our country."
Mr. Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is absolutely wrong.”
Anti-Brexit Tory leader Andrei Jenkins was also present in the march and told reporters: “I just say: Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Checkers are unpopular in the general public and the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and our workers who fill the streets elect us.
"Please listen to the listeners."
In a special message to Ms. May, she said, "The great ones will remain as long as they keep their promises."
Mr. Farid told the rally that if politicians are going to betray the 2016 referendum, they will have to "feel angry."
He said: "It's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell you that we’re not going to let you do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic community, he said: “I want to make my political class feel sad and angry who are on the brink of betrayal from Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has made us successful in Brexit, and we will not leave China until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK,” he said.
Meanwhile, Brexit opponents marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A small number of workers oppose Tory Brexit at the group's launch this week that the banners should be lifted.
Laborer Rafiq Lord Addons had fun with the Conservatives on security issues that came to him with the party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT system for free trade without a barrier between the border and Ireland, and the entire technology and everything for Canada," he said.
“It’s a full-fledged dungeon.
He added: "There's nothing better than a bridge.
Warren plans to “deeply consider” the president’s election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "make a fuss" about running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Democratic leader of Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is fighting re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, he had his 36th meeting with constitutionalists on Saturday afternoon in Hollyoke, using the Town Hall format.
One of the attendees asked if she planned to contest the presidential election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes women in high positions," Warren said.
LSU's Sims has been arrested in connection with the death by shooting.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the death of LSU basketball player Wade Sams.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, identifying a man who is calling for help.
Sam, 20, was shot dead near the southern university campus on Friday morning.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday on 247sports, "Wade Sams was shot in the head and eventually died."
Wade came forward in defense of his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present with the weapon on the spot and also admitted to shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sams, a 6-foot 6-inch tall youngster in Baton Rouge, took part in 32 games last season as a 10-time first-time player and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton in Team Orders came closer to the world title after the victory against the Sabrestin Wheatley.
It was at that moment that it became clear that Valtteri Bottas had qualified before Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes team would play a major role in the Orders race.
From the pool, Bottas made a good start and almost outplayed Hamilton when defending his position during the first two rounds and invited Wittel to attack against his teammate.
Vettel went into the first pits and pushed Hamilton into the traffic on the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later completed the lap and came in the rear of the Wittel, but at the same time Hamilton went ahead in the race when the driver of the Ferrari hesitated and threatened the inner side by running a double in the defense of the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh position by the end of the first lap.
He then advanced to the big part of the race when he put his tires up to make a quick finish and left the deficit Rickonian behind for the fourth position.
He eventually got into the pits in the 44th lap, but during the remaining eight laps he failed to raise his pace when Rikkonen took the fourth position.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the week and was a really good guy who let go.
"The team that retained the first two positions has done a fantastic job," Hamilton said.
These were very bad physical symptoms.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finstein at a rally on Saturday on the insistence that he did not disclose the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony he gave before the Senate Geodetic Committee of Ford, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "wanted, disgusted and liars."
"One thing that could have happened, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is that when you see anger, when you see mean, disgusting, and lying people," he said.
"When you see things going on and exposed and then say, 'Oh, I didn't do this.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Finestein, did you reveal?
Remember the answer to the question, "What did you do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't make a fuss."
Okay, wait a minute.
He added of a senator's expression, "We didn't disclose... No, we didn't."
Finestein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed in early September - however, Finestein denied that the disclosure was from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Finstein told the committee, according to Hill's report.
"They told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as they told me."
But his denial was not correct according to the president who commented on it during the rally on Saturday: "I tell you that it was a very bad pattern.
"Maybe it wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen."
Defending his representative for the Supreme Court, whom three women have accused of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges to their advantage.
"They are determined to take back power.
You're watching their crap, their crap, they don't care who they hurt, they have to crush for power and control," the president's words to the media.
Elite League (Dunee Stars) 5-3 Belfast Giants (Belfast Giants)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars won the return match 3-5 on Saturday for the loss against Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
The Giants outscored through the initial two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller.
Mike Sloan and Jordan Cohen equalised the home side before Dover regained the lead of the Giants.
François Bouchard equalized Dundee and later Lucas Lindwald Nelson's shots ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the players of Adam Caffey, who came up from a weak spot to beat Dundee 1-2 at Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams in which the Giants had won the last three matches.
Dwayne's first goal came through Kendall McFaul's assist at 3:35 in the fourth minute, while Beowulf provided the assist by David Rutherford when he doubled the lead 4 minutes later.
Although it was a busy start time, Matt Markwart brought Slyon home side back to the game at 13:10 before the second goal of the Cowboys at 15:16.
Dwayne made sure the Giants were ahead of the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first break.
The home side regrouped and again came to par through the power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nelson out together to lead Dundee for the first time shortly before the second break in the match, and he ensured the win with his team's fifth goal in the final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes to play their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers gave their lives to ensure that hundreds of people on board the plane survived the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero who lost his life savings while ensuring that the plane filled with hundreds of people flew safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing in a major earthquake that triggered a tsunami in Solvaysi on Friday.
The powerful tremors that followed the quake have spread to the area and many people have been displaced by the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, a 21-year-old Antonis Gonwan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavy-duty control tower at Matiara Suss Al Jufri Airport, Palo Airport.
He stayed there to make sure that Battic Air Flight 6321 flew safely, which was on the runway at the time.
Then when he realized that the traffic control tower was about to fall, he jumped from the tower.
He later died in the hospital.
Australia's ABC News reported that the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Syritz, said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We developed a helicopter in Kali Mantan to take him from Balkuppan to another city major hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added: "Our hearts are saddened by this.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to Dong Gala, Sigi and Bootung is limited.
"The death toll is estimated to be rising because many people were trapped under debris and many could not be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Stupo Provo Nigrou.
Waves reaching 6 metres have destroyed Palo where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial ships are bringing aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Resa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every moment an ambulance brings a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Small businesses are coming back."
John Gilfland, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working at a lightning speed to help survivors, but we don't know what they will get there.
There has already been an accident, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I call on all of you to work day and night in all matters relating to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
An earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Lombok last year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air New Guinea says one man is missing after the plane crash
The airline, which operates a cruise in the Pacific logo in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, while the airline said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking ship.
Air New Guinea said in a release that by Saturday afternoon, she had been unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the lives of other passengers and crew after the ship collided with water in an attempt to land at the Cheekland Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers remained in the hospital and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy, said the plane landed in Lagos some distance from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the ship had gone ahead of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane had come down too low.
"It's a very good thing," Jones said.
Gienz said he and other passengers went through an emergency exit route on the sinking ship and stayed in deep waters up to the waist.
He said the flight attendants were worried and were running and that he also suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the nearby port before the ship sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) of water also helped rescue operations by bringing people from the water to shore through a floating boat.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in incidents of plane crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, while air navigation was not included.
Analysts gave a timeline of the night when the woman was burnt alive.
Prosecutors completed their arguments in a man's retrial on Saturday, accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlatt testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He sketched for the jury how he used cell phone records of 29-year-old defendant Quentin Tellis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the target, to gather movements and sketches of the night of his death.
Clarion Ledger said Rowlatt said he received location data from several cell phones showing that Telus was with the evening chambers of his death, which contradicted his previous claims.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during that time, Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew him for two weeks.
Cell phone records indicate that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlatt said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He said, "He took her out of his life."
The lawyers will start their arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's the Brave Hip Hop?
A three-person hip hop group wants to challenge the negative perspective about this type of music by adding positive messages to their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed that the hip hop has deviated from its original purpose of correcting political messages and social issues.
They want to take it to its original and re-populate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Common have seen a recent reception in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
There's another black hole?
Nanny from New York filed a lawsuit against the couple after they were fired on a "genocide" message.
A mistaken message sent by a babysitter from New York, complaining that she was "another black," is being sued for discriminating against the couple.
The couple denied that they were racist and expressed the possibility that the trial's purpose was to "get the taboo."
Lance Plasco Felixman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at the arrival of the baby's new care provider, Jessie Maris, on the first day of 2016 that she was black.
Mrs. Plasco Felixman sent a message to her husband, "No, another black man."
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, on realizing his mistake, Plasco Felixman dismissed the African-American nanny, Miss Marius, saying that she was not doing her job properly and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Morris was paid her one day's wages and then sent home via Uber.
Now Maris is seeking compensation for the couple's expulsion and has been demanding a compensation of up to $350 per day for the same work for six months, for which she was hired without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discriminatory."
The couple denied the accusation of racism, saying that removing Marius was a reasonable thing to do because they couldn't rely on him to make him angry.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't intend to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post.
But will you give your child to someone you're trying to change with, even if by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Try to understand it."
Coloring the case as "tawan," Plasco said his wife is about to become a mother two months later and is "suffering from a very difficult situation."
"Are you following someone like that?"
It's not an appreciable act," the investor banker said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been intensifying the couple's take on social media and criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that publishers in Paddington are afraid that readers will not meet with the bear who speaks.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard for a first-time reader to feel someone else's place before it's published.
It's great to know what's behind the success of Pedington.
Talking about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book about a small toy bear, he said he was quite optimistic about his book's rejection, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books after his death last year was "subtle but sweet."
Talking about Paddington, which she describes as a very important member of her family, she added that her father was extremely proud of her ultimate success.
He said: "He was a quiet man and he was not shy.
"But because Paddington was so real to them, it's just like having a child and they succeed: you're proud of them even if it's not your achievement.
I think they saw Paddington's success as something like this.
Although it was their creation and conception, they always credited Paddington themselves.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was immediately taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Ned was regularly calling to tell us that his condition is very bad and that he is not expected to survive," said Eden Leprosy.
"Then I got a call from Ned that he would die in a minute or two and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to him by doctors to keep his heart pumping were gradually losing its effect and leaving his system.
She died some time ago, and it's all over now.
I just had to sit there, knowing that it was going to be obvious.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk,
I really had to stand up."
Finally, Mrs. Eden Leprosy, who died on her daughter's death, boarded the ship along with other passengers - who were unfamiliar with the grief she endured.
He said, "Nobody knows."
"My head was down and tears were dripping from my eyes all the time."
It's hard to explain, but it happened during the flight when I had severe emotional sympathy for Ned.
I need your love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women posting cards to prevent suicide on bridges.
Two women, who have lost their loved ones due to suicide, are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, which people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
He said: "I don't want to see my parents feel the same way I do every day.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in London, said her son was a gifted chef with an impressive smile.
Everyone knows him because of his smile.
He always said that his smile could illuminate any room.
However, he left work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after his death.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that this thing could have an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards, "to bring people to the knowledge that there are people in the world with whom you can go and talk, even if they are friends."
"Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother's death.
"He never said he was depressed or upset or anything like that," he said.
A few days before Christmas, we felt a change in his behavior.
He was extremely sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't meet their eyes or do anything else."
He said his death was a great shock to them, but they had to go through it: "It creates a void in the family.
It breaks us down.
But we all have to fight it."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in the middle after the FBI's investigation began.
"I thought we could really do what he's saying - investigations that have limited scope and time - maybe we could create some unity about it," Flick said in a statement on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "distributed" due to partisan grouping.
"Why don't you want Mr. Kevana and his Republican supporters to be investigated by the FBI?
It's only because of time.
The midterm elections to be held on November 6 are just five weeks away - if Republicans lose badly as expected, they will be extremely vulnerable in their efforts to elect their representative to the country's highest judiciary.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators and trying to get in touch with Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House, through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI report comes out?
The right to vote will be exercised in the Senate with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will enable Vice President Mike Pence to stall and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans has decreased.
A South Korean lawmaker has said the number of North Koreans going to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Boyong Seong, referring to data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 deviants last year - 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is much easier to cross between the two Koreas than the highly secure non-military zone (DMZ).
China considers perverts more illegal immigrants than refugees and often sends them back using force.
Relations between North and South Korea - technically still in a state of war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at advancing stagnant negotiations aimed at reducing nuclear weapons.
The meeting came after U.S. President Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June, when they agreed to broader terms for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of slowing growth.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first," he said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kevana a victim of "hijacking" and further stated that she was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Representative Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kevana a "huge victim" and said she was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi responded to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, saying, "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman does something like this, she will call it "happy."
Kevana emotionally denied the allegations that she sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, when they were both young.
At the beginning of his statement, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional and sometimes ran and panicked, talking about his family and high school years.
He openly criticised the Democrats' deputies, calling the accusations "a ridiculous and coordinated attack on the character" produced by the Liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he was convinced that Kevana's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it proved that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think they've disqualified themselves by making such statements and criticizing the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When Pelosi was asked if there was confirmation about Kavanaugh, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, would they try to impeach him, they acted backwards on it.
"I would say -- if they're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not even eligible to live in the Supreme Court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about a possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade of Kavanaugh because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh dismissed questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that surprising?'"
Women need to take control of it.
It's hard to believe that months and years of grief go by and they can't get rid of it without crying.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry."
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
She went on to say, "A woman who was in the executive position at some point helped me a lot, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she acquired a talent that meant that when she was angry, she would start crying, the person she talked to would say to her, 'Maybe you'll cry with me.'
But then I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was awesome.
Tears are partly allowed to evoke anger because they have been fundamentally misunderstood.
A male-dominated office has a great memoir of an early job, where I found myself crying with unspeakable anger when I was caught by a big woman by my neck - a cold-blooded manager who had always been afraid of something - and that pushed me into the jungle of the Zeena.
He told me, "Don't let others see you crying."
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're depressed and they're happy that they've conquered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart during his election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found involved in an unmarried affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and left the race, Ms. Schroeder became very depressed and there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency herself.
Thirty years later, he told me with a joke, "It wasn't a thought-provoking decision."
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Boons".
Because it was too late in the campaign and she was far behind in the matter of raising funds, and so she vowed not to join the race until she raised $2 million.
It was a dubious war.
They found that some of their supporters who gave the men $1,000 would only give them $250.
He asked me, "Do you think I'm going to get it?"
When he made his speech announcing that he would not start a formal campaign, he was shocked by the emotions, thanks to the people who supported him, upset by the system that created so much difficulty in raising funds and targeting the votes instead of the delegation, and the sense of sexual thinking.
Mrs. Schroeder recalled the press's response to it, saying, "You'd think I'd have a nerve breakdown."
"You may have felt that Clinics was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they're going to write in my book.
"Do they cry?"
How will the trade war between the US and China benefit China?
According to experts, the opening of the trade war between the US and China was very noisy and as the war is not over yet, the tensions between the two countries could be beneficial to China.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year of a tax on major Chinese exporters of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week when new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods were imposed, which taxed nearly half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded with a five to ten percent tax on the most recent $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has indicated a shot in exchange for the US and the world's second-largest economy is not currently in a weakening position.
Forcing the U.S. to return would mean accepting its demands, but publicly submitting to the U.S. would be a disgrace to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts still say that China can do its job well, with the U.S. trade war likely to have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the pressure on the two countries to depend on each other.
"The fact that the immediate political decision of either the United States or China could create conditions that could create economic problems for either of the two countries is far more dangerous than previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the think tank focused on Asia for the Center for New American Security.
The minister said Syria was "prepared" for the return of refugees.
Syria has said it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and has appealed for a rebuilding of the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure than the progress made by the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rehabilitating areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to bring the situation back to normal.
Now there are all sorts of conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have damaged their homes and their bars and professions.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than 6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Malam said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or support from countries that contributed to the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
In the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France, Europe defeated the US team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the United States has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reclaimed the honor when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the US team.
American star Phil McLean, who suffered most of the tournament, threw his T-shirt in the water in the 3rd, 16th hole and lost his match to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was successful in all his rounds and joined the 4 players who have scored 5-0-0 since the formation of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American player Jared Spieth was defeated by European team's lowest-ranked player Thor Beverly Olson 5 and 4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ean Peller, who may be playing his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia became the tournament's highest-grossing European player with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I couldn't be patient today.
It has been a difficult year.
So, thank you to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm happy to win the cup.
It's all about the team and I'm very happy that I was able to play my part," Garcia said after the European victory.
He moved the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a game on Sunday.
"I'm proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time is the player odd statistics that have won all the major 14 awards since Jack Nicklaus.
In addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaou, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament, the US team struggled to find ease throughout the week.
Speaking after the disappointing performance of his squad, US captain Jim Forrak said, "I'm proud of these players, they tried."
There was a time when we put some pressure on European players this morning.
But we have failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players offered a very good game.
We will be together again, I will work with the American PGA and our Rider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
"I love these 12 players and I'm proud to captain them.
You have to appreciate it.
We had a good game."

According to the FWC, conditions such as peach blossom have been reported in the areas of Pennsyls, Minotaur, Sarasota, Shalit and Collier counties - which indicate a decrease in concentration.
The red wave of an entire Juben extends approximately 130 miles from the coast of the northern peninsula to the southern Lee counties.
The Peaks Hills are 10 miles off the coast of Borough County, but can be seen in lesser locations than last week.
The red wave has also been seen in Pasco County.
Last week average concentration in Peniels County or near the coast, minimum concentration near the coast of Hillsborough County, background-to-high concentration in Monterey County, background-to-high concentration near the coast in Sarasota County, background-to-high concentration in Shalit County, background-to-high concentration in Le County,
Respiratory problems are still ongoing in Pennsylvania, Manitoba, Sarasota, Lee and Cologne counties.
There were no reports of respiratory problems in Northwest Florida last week.
