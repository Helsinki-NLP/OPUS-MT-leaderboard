The overall spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased sharply in the EU/EEA and the UK from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
Similar trends are being expressed in the overall spread of cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the UK, while the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries is increasing rapidly at different stages depending on the country.
Based on Italy's experience, hospitals and intensive care units from several countries should increase their preparedness due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will require special intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause agent is Novel Coronavirus, now known as Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, there is evidence that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections, i.e., with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
COVID-19 is more serious in 14% of cases, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of cases require intensive care for those with severe illness.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we will assess trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in every country in the EU/EEA and in the UK (UK) and compare them with the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the U.S.
After China, there was a further geographic spread of COVID-19, and the dynamic state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world corresponds to the same country at the moment.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, the Secretary-General reported the first European confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to WHO case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported on January 24, 2020, by three French people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had reported COVID-19 cases, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported during today's date from 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Achieving aggregate data and aggregate spread of COVID-19 cases
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) data for COVID-19 cases in every country around the world comes only from official sources, the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the total spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK over the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19.
We compared with Italy for the period from 31st January to 15th March 2020 and presented the total number of notified cases of each country till 8:00 AM on 15th March 2020
COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and the United States
In general, the 14-day total spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is in accordance with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, and then the increase accelerated to 28 February 2020.
This was largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has been shown to be similar to the rising trends (reported content).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, in comparison with Italy during the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
It was highlighted that, as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, the total number of cases in other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK reported earlier than in Italy, just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is growing at a pace of comparison across all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in national public health responses and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for selecting patients must be tested to confirm COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors from affected areas in Italy reported a situation in which 10 percent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reported that hospital and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on COVID-19 cases admissions in any hospital and/or intensive care unit for 6% and 1% cases at EU/EEA levels, respectively, is available (the figures are not shown).
However, recent monitoring data, including the completion of reported cases and the number of deaths, should be collected in a systematic manner.
A 2010-11 study showed that the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds for 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal has significantly changed.
This means that these countries will have fewer resources like Italy (there are 12.5 intensive care and mid-care beds for every 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Model assessments of hospitalized COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK that are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 are provided in the ECDC's intensive assessment holiday update.
As the EU/EEA countries and specific regions of the UK have so far had a cascade of cases, and generally hospitals and intensive care units describe the region's population, preferential figures of information on cases and intensive care beds are given in Figure 2 (NUTS-2).
The current trends from the situation in Italy and other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the permanent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the increase in COVID-19 patients such as those in the affected areas of Italy requires special intensive care.
As a recent ECDC acute concern assessment, a sharp, proactive and comprehensive approach has been described as necessary for delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in preventive mitigation approach, if not premature implementation, to allow for the timely and predictable increase in the number of cases, such decision makers and speculators.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a small opportunity for countries to further increase their containment efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care providers.
By failing to do so, it is likely that health care systems in EU/EEA countries will face the need for intensive care due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The most severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people anywhere in China and the world, resulting in devastating consequences for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to bats and cause the same symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19 are lower than that of SARS, but it affects more women than older adults and men than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about emerging disease, this article seeks to present a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics about epidemics, virology, epidemics, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of diseases.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 became an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people due to the Novel Viral Disease outbreak and the insistence on staying at home for all holidays and several weeks.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its associated disease is called CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to about 50 other countries across the country and around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering from the virus and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and that it is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, which includes its virology, epidemic, causes, treatment and diagnosis after the first report of January 7, 2020, and which has determined the isolation of a number of patients.
This review attempts to summarize creative progress in the field of new and rapidly evolving topics.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We will also talk about what we have learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease, as well as some of the important questions that remain.
For humans, CoV has traditionally been considered non-malignant pathogens, mainly due to about 15% of the common low 4's.
However, in this century, we had two of the most deadly CoVs, SARS CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon the dreaded disease spread to many other countries with its mortality rate.
This is the third COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
As shown in figure 1,1, the source of the pneumonia, which is unknown, was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, an infection was reported in health care providers, meaning it could be transmitted from human to human.
On January 23, all public transport in the city of Wuhan was shut down.
On January 24, the first medical study of the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered to be the site of the onset of the infection by an unknown means of animals.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report came out, the disease had already spread to nearly 50 countries across China and around the world (Fig. 2.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, another updated explanation of the epidemic was described in a multidisciplinary study listed in zil (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the victims were over the age of 50, very little under the age of 20, and only 14 of the victims were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread to and around the world.
The average number of COVID-19 cases from the start was 5 (9-2) days.
The average duration of growth was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to finish was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary output number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the time of mass transportation before the spring fair in China, the number of infected people rose sharply before June 23, 2020.
The case fatality rate of confirmed cases was 1.44 (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of a large and malignant virus, which is a component of the RNA synthesis of the senses.
They are divided into four races, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, of which Alpha and Beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
The encapsulated spike (S) binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-altering enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptide peptides 4 (DPP4), respectively, to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then to membrane fusion.
Viral genomes are released into the cytoplasma, then after a copy of the viral genome, the genomes form a version of the glycoplasma associated with the RNA and the new cytocalypse, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
More than 99.98% of SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from the original site of the outbreak linked to the Huan seafood market in Wuhan have been genetically identified as a new type of BTA.
Genetically speaking, SARS-CoV-2 is more common than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to the transfer of electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the ultra-thin part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S-Lymphocyte is more vulnerable to SARS-CoV than human ACE2, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV causes less infections than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form encrypted nodules encoded by orf3b and by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in the viral pathogen city and express itself in the IFNB, although there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhao et al., reported a complex resolution in the structure of the EM in the full length of the human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> detail with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complexity, in which the open and closed variables were combined as a diamer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complexity could bind to two S molecules, which simulate the identification and proof of CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for drug screening in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the representative
It is well known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both from bats, have been transmitted to humans through seed cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is similar to the two SARS-like bats of 96 percent of bats, such as CoVs bet-SL-CoVZX45 and bet-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is not yet known which media representative has helped overcome barriers to affecting humans, and the path of transmission cannot be explained.
G., et al., had proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, including Homologous Restoration within the S protein.
According to a study in Guangzhou, China, researchers have suggested that 99 percent of the long-snout penguins, ants-eating mammals found in traditional Chinese medicine, pegoline, and SARS-CoV-2 could be the potential intermediate representative of SARS-CoV-2 because of the genetic homogeneity.
However, the 1% difference in the spread between the two genomes is still a big difference, similarly, waiting for the final results of comprehensive evidence (Fig. 33).
Most of the physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 40%-50% in humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, and heats up to 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, or 75% of ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracetamol, chloroform, and other fatty germs, but chloroquine cannot inactivate the virus effectively.
In general, the entire human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4.4).
Typically, when a representative is attacked by a virus, the representative's immune system is comprised of first-class receptors (PRRs), including C-type lacton-like receptors (TLRs), nose-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through a variety of methods, virus inflammation factors, the maturity of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of the number I type interferon (IFNs), which restricts the spread of the virus and stimulates its viral antigens, accelerating microfeed phagocytosis.
However, SARS-CoV's N lymphoma can help prevent the virus from responding to immune responses.
Soon, a favorable immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B>, play an important role in the defense of cells.
To develop specific antibodies to the virus, T cells of CD4<0x2B> stimulate B cells, and T cells of CD8<0x2B> directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support immune cells.
However, CoV to T cells can inhibit the functions of T cells by giving apoptosis.
Hormonal immunity, including C3a and C5a, and antibody supplements are essential to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized from the antibody isolated from the recovered patient.
On the other hand, abuse in the immune system causes many free radicals locally that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case scenario, many organs stop working and even die.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been prominent since the onset of clustering, and is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have two to four viruses in large numbers or who have weakened immune functions, and are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the first 425 case studies in Wuhan, the duration of SARS-CoV-2 development is an average of 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, according to a study conducted on 1,099 cases, the average duration of growth is from 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a recent study shows that the growth period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to schedule an effective time of quarantine based on the most appropriate period of growth to prevent people from transmitting the virus to people who are infected but have no symptoms.
In general, people infected with the virus or infected with it need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty in breathing, muscle ache, headache, sore throat, knee, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience respiratory arrest and/or shocks one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with severe respiratory syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidity, and freezing quickly improve.
Symptoms of fever and/or respiratory distress and severe fever, even against normal pulmonary imaging, should be checked for early diagnosis of patients with pneumonia.
A population study at the end of December 2019 found that 98 percent of patients with fever, 76 percent with dry cough, 55 percent with respiratory failure and 3 percent with diarrhea needed ventilation assistance.
In two recent studies, similar findings have been made about the cause of a stroke through domestic shock and the transfer from an unmarked individual.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that MERS-CoV patients also had primary symptoms of fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent), and respiratory failure (55 percent).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and MERS was more deadly than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26 percent) and throat inflammation (21 percent).
It has been shown that SARS patients have primary symptoms of fever (100-99 percent), dry cough (75-29 percent), shortness of breath (42-40 percent), diarrhea (25-20 percent) and throat inflammation (25-13 percent), and about 20-14 percent of patients needed ventilation assistance.
As of February 14, the global case fatality rate in COVID-19 was 2% when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In contrast, the mortality rate in confirmed cases of SARS as of November 2002 was 8,096%.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate in 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study reported that the R0 reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 was higher by 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 reproductive range of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
This table table 1.1 presents a comparison of the symptoms, mortality and reproductive numbers of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The data above shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than the latter two viruses.
So, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Often, the collision begins with a ship of the same family or the same gathering or riding.
Often patients have a history of travel or accommodation in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected people or patients, in the recent two weeks before the start.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus inside for up to two weeks without showing symptoms, and patients recovering from the hospital may be re-infected with the virus, which rings a bell to extend the quarantine time.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be less or equal at initial levels (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L in lymphocytes <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were found to have levels of sporadic immunotransfusions and viremia.
In some patients, enzymes and myoglobin levels in the blood increased in the liver and muscles, and in most patients, C-inactivated lymphoma and etherosite sediment increased in the blood.
In patients with severe cases, the blood-borne D-diamer, the lack of faeces, was increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Contrary to the usual characteristics in the chest radiography of COVID-19 patients, the two-way complex shadow in the lungs or ground glass is characterized by blurryness.
Often in patients with common pneumonia, severe lung distress, severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Breathing disorders, uncontrolled inflammation, the collection of fluids and increasing fibrosis are largely compromised in the exchange of gases.
The inactivation of type I and type II pneumoniae reduces the level of the head factor and increases the level of tension, thus reducing the risk of lung spread and their failure.
Therefore, the results of the worst radiography of the chest are parallel to the extreme extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, as in SARS and MERS patients and in the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 according to the pathology of ARDS and viral infections, the patient died of the disease in the lungs of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, and medial lymphocyte insufficiency, and multicellular sinus.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was an important criterion for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
In China, on February 13, 2020, due to the high rate of negative lying, which could accelerate the epidemic, medical data for diagnosis was started (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, in the history of the disease, medical explanations, laboratory tests, and radiological results must all be present.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based Sherlock technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which also requires the use of RNA fragments from synthetic SARS-CoV-2 at intervals of 20x10-18 microliters/liters to 200x10-18 microliters/liters (100 microliters/liters) without needing time to assemble RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2.
It is hoped that if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, primarily therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying different treatments that were previously prescribed or used for treatment in other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These methods of treatment include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychotherapy.
Even healthy patients' plasma was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Initially, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs, and perhaps other organs expressing a small amount of ACE2, such as the stomach and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and lung failure are the biggest risk and major cause of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help alleviate symptoms and save lives, ventilation with normal oxygen, rapid flow oxygen, uninterrupted ventilation and mechanical interference are included in the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe pain in the respiratory system have to seek help through a faltto-corporal oxygen membrane (ECMO), using modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique to treat the risk of life-threatening heart attack or respiratory failure.
In addition, for the maintenance of electrolight, secondary infection and septic shock treatment and prevention are necessary to protect vital organ functions in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is said that in patients with SARS and MERS, an overdose of the immune system results in the cytokine syndrome.
Cytokine Stream is a type of systematic inflammatory response produced by a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
The large number of free radicals that are the major cause of severe pain syndrome in the respiratory system and the failure of various organs, these citokine immune cells are involved to release.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine syndrome, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroids and toxoplasmosis IL6 anti-molecular antibody have been used to treat cytokine storm.
In the treatment of suppressing other immune systems of the cytokine stream; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was blocked; JAK was blocked; and HADC inhibitor, directed modification of the T-cell of the immune response.
To reduce the severity of inflammation damage in SARS, steroids were widely used as amino acids as a treatment.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially affecting the diagnosis of avascular osteonecrosis in a dramatic way.
Nevertheless, patients with severe COVID-19 have been advised to use short courses of corticosteroid-induced doses with caution.
As of now, no effective antiviral treatment has been found.
However, in an American patient with COVID-19, the nucleotide analog was found to be effective, with the vaccine being injected into the vein.
Remittance is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Galid for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, the remitter was classified as potentially blocked to prevent other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Galid provided a combination of these to China for a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with results much higher than expected.
In addition, baristatinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/retonavir, and ribovirin have been suggested for possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
In combination with lopinavir/retonavir, treatment can cause diarrhea, vomiting, liver damage, and other negative reactions.
The combination of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from Recovered Patients and Antibody Genes
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from this infectious disease to protect other patients treated or healthy people from the disease.
In fact, most recovering patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin(Ig) that help fight pathogens and other externalities through B-lemon fissures and identify and directly inhibit unique molecules on the pathogen.
Based on this, plasma from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 was collected and admitted to 10 critically ill patients.
Symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood improve within 24 hours.
However, the specific treatment has not yet been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and explain it before suggesting it to be used extensively.
In addition, seeing the effects of treatment, some of the harms associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies increase immune response, and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially deadly poison.
Generally, the number of antibodies in the blood is low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of severe sick patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies so quickly to fight the pandemic.
Isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic code to encode effective antibodies against the virus is a delicate and difficult process.
In this way we can speed up the process of antibody preparation.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of several components in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or ambiguous because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combinations.
Currently, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stage due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Zhu Feng Jie Lu capsules and Li Huang Chen van capsules have been proven to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
Various provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hanan (50%), saw a high rate of improvement in treatment of COVID-19 in 87% of their patients using traditional Chinese medicine, while Hubei Province, which had a lower rate of only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, used traditional Chinese medicine.
However, this is a fairly strict comparison, as many other factors such as the number and severity of patients should also be included in the effects of this analysis.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zheng and his colleagues published a study on comparing Western medicine and the treatment of Western medicine (WM) with traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that only Western medicine <0x2B> traditional Chinese medicine group had an abnormally shorter recovery of body temperature, elimination of symptoms, and duration of hospital stay, compared to the Western medicine group.
Very impressively, the symbolically increasing sign (lightly severe) was only slightly lower in the WM group than the WM<0x2B>TCM group (46.2% compared to 7.4%) and the mortality rate (39% compared to 8.8%) was exceptionally low.
However, traditional Chinese medicine still awaits more good and controlled trials of its performance and safety in larger and more centers.
It will be interesting to highlight the procedure of treating traditional Chinese medicine, their effective ingredients, or, if possible, their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are most likely to experience fears of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantine people experience boredom, isolation, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, tremors, and cough, as well as cartico steroids, can lead to negative effects of treatment such as insomnia, more anxiety, and mental tension.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have reported persistent mental stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, depression, and suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing and quarantine can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public who also need mental health care should be provided.
Multi-disciplinary mental health teams should be established in the provisional support, with consistent and accurate updates on the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and its treatment plans, and in order to avoid close contact with each other.
There must be an effective vaccine to prevent transmission from animal fencing, and from infected humans to sensitive representatives, and antiviral treatment is often necessary to control the emerging virus epidemic.
Efforts have been made to develop S-leukemia-based vaccines to develop long-term and viable neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS.
A direct impact vaccine for SARS was analyzed in animal samples.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates cannot be determined in protecting older adults, deadly challenge samples and animal virus infections before medical studies begin.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported so far.
Conversely, the MERS outbreak is continuing in areas where there are permanent sources of the animal virus, except in the Middle East.
A vaccine strategy for the prevention of MERS has been developed using subunits of viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses such as particulate matter and recovered lymphoma, and some of these have been tested on animal samples.
Preparation of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task to overcome the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is a challenge due to the need for long-term (average 18 months) for vaccine development and dynamic variations of CoVs.
COVID-19 has begun to show its medical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without any complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with more disease and death in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, health-care agencies must formulate diagnostic models of the disease to prioritise their services in low-resource areas.
Based on the medical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or impact of COVID-19 patients (table (table 33).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred in people aged 65-30 years, 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the above-mentioned study were over the age of 50.
Patients who are more likely to have underlying complications are more likely to need intensive care, and are more likely to be older than those who do not have such complications (average age of 66 years instead of 51), which presents age as a diagnostic procedure for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.27/100,000 compared to 0.31/100,000).
We Prevent and Complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory failure.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2-positive chondrocyte, which can lead to liver impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and the underlying disease have a strong relationship and they can interfere with each other.
Extraordinary results from the lab: The C reactive lymphatic (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a possible analytical process for the treatment response and final recovery of the disease.
The association of C-reactive leukemia levels has been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenesis (LDH), sputum aminotransferase (AST), alain aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed in a number of organs, especially the heart and liver, and they occur through tissue damage.
So, they are the traditional signs of heart or liver failure.
Important Medical Symptoms: The temporary improvement of chest radiography and medical symptoms should be considered combined with other tissues to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly used to reduce the severity of inflammation damage as an auxiliary treatment for infectious disease.
Since multiple doses of corticosteroids were widely used in SARS-infected patients, many survivors suffered avascular osteochondrosis with age-related disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, very small amounts of steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients for a short period of time.
Mental strain: As mentioned above, many patients suffered abnormal strains during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to prolonged quarantine and observing the irrational death of close family and fellow patients.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to bring these patients back to normal life and recovery.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, it seems that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2, in addition to gluing into the lower respiratory tract, can also gluing into the upper respiratory tract, and cause a mild or no symptom similar to the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the growth period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which makes it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is severely ill, while there is not much transmission in the early stage.
Thus the current COVID-19 pandemic is far more severe than the SARS epidemic and is quite difficult to control.
At present, in China, hopes and efforts are underway to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by keeping the city and surrounding cities locked down and the entire population in continuous quarantine.
While these measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, it is slowing down the number of new patients, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most welcome thing is that the epidemic will end in March and its twin swing phase will be in 3 to 4 months.
However, other experts are not so hopeful.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Erra Lungi et al., set a model for predicting the outcome of the global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A group in Canada said that two weeks ago, mid-turbines and throat testicles from patients who had recovered from the hospital showed that they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the newly identified virus could become a circulating strain of influenza.
However, based on the number of new cases, there are promising indicators in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
One million cases were predicted in Ebola, with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been cured.
It is also possible that SARS-CoV, like SARS-CoV-2, weakens and eventually eliminates the spread of the disease or stays with humans like a less infectious virus.
The following format provides comparisons of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with the virus.
The virus is also found in the mouth, which creates a new possibility of transmission from the mouth to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely due to non-neurotic infections, with 17 patients already suffering from another disease and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, householders, colleagues, and even those who are in contact with patients or affected people, should be very careful.
To reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask on the front of the defense; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask prevents liquid droplets from a potential infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects from which they can reach others.
However, only N95 (Circle <0x23>1860) masks can prevent small viral particles from inhaling from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viral particles can enter fully, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both about 85 nm.
Although five surgical masks can still be inserted, health care providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial <0x23>1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear an isolation gown to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he had to wear an N95 mask; the virus was often infiltrated by his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should wear a transparent shield or spring on the face when working with patients.
It is highly advisable for people in affected or potentially affected areas to often wash their hands more frequently than usual with disinfectant soap, quarantine themselves indoors, and try to limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet of distance from the patient is considered appropriate.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the highest homogeneity of SARS-CoV, according to a January 7, 2020 report, and should cause high alerts for China based on a deep recollection of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control comforted the citizens by saying that the novel virus has less infectious and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and that the prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
The message calmed the alarm of the public, especially when they were preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted time to control the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
In China, disease control agencies may have learned a lesson from this difficulty and made significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be careful when making (1) public announcements as every word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) the use of formal reports of physicians or personnel to inform the public of the incidence and the incidence of the incidence of the incidence of the disease and the incidence of the incidence of the incidence of the incidence of the disease; and the response to the incidence of the in the incidence of the incidence of the disease; (3) to the possible and possible in the intratratratratra-ve in the disease.
The COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and around 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of the re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults than young people and more men than women and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older people than young people.
SARS mortality rates are higher than COVID-19 (%1.44) compared to 10.91.
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
Otherwise, the virus can be positive again in recovered patients.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of key issues remain to be addressed, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homogeneity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Who was the first person to transmit the virus from a bat to a human?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively reduce the transfer process and it can re-spread at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic continue?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end like SARS, or will it continue to happen from time to time like a cold?
This is important but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The origins of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, evolution and adaptation have advanced the mutual evolution of coronaviruses and their host organisms, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known for mild illnesses such as common colds.
The Severe Respiratory Incontinence System (SARS) and the Middle East's Respiratory System (MERS) bounced back to show how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and its faster transmission and reduction in pathogenesis than its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
HCoV infection is an infection that is transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand the animal origin of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known as intermediate host organisms.
Identifying host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Enquiries about CoV-hosted organisms in animals provide important information about the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the knowledge available about seven HCoVs, in which we focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their animal origins and mixed algae transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and their genetic regeneration.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic will be under discussion.
In addition, the impacts of virus prevention on the requirements of successful host organisms changes and the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviruses, including a group of enveloped, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The viruses that used large genes such as 26 to 32 kilobases between RNA viruses were called "CoV" due to the appearance of crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Constructively, CoVs have, in a similar way, participating, non-participating genes.
About two-thirds of the genes contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polynomial map of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polymorphism applies to another 16 non-synthetic polymorphisms, named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remainder of the genes are ORFs for structural lattice, including node(S), membrane(E), membrane(M) and nucleus(N).
A large number of specific sequences of supporting sequences are also encoded through different sequences of CoVs.
Based on the differences in luteinization settings, CoVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV generation mostly composed of HCoVs and further divided into series (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence from phylogenesis showed that most bats and mice are the source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genetics, while the largest deposits of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently surpassed the barriers of different species, and some of them emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Symptoms such as HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are usually mild colds and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary exacerbation in more patients.
In the mid-1960s, the strain of HCoV-229E, B814, isolated nasal discharges from patients with mild colds.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the idea was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs in general is harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is the most devastating event in the current history, affecting more than 8,000 people with a nearly 10% mortality rate.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East resulted in a permanent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the whole world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives as of March 3, 2020 and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm is ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originate from animals such as bats, rats or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support bats of the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs, where the virus is well adapted and exhibits non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the source animal of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the power of the spread, and the factors of transmission restriction in different species.
This may also help or guide the search for SARA-CoV-2 deposits, intermediate and breeding animal hosts, with significant implications for preventing future recurrence.
In this review we will present an overview of the pathogenesis of source animals, mixed algae transmission and HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the shared idea that the parental viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir host organisms and become pathogenic after being transferred to their new host organism.
We also examine the evolutionary trend of HCoVs, which often increase transmission with reduction in the pathogen.
In this context, the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, different animals infected with different CoVs, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, were isolated.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs by historical sequence (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, HCoV-229E pressure was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with respiratory tract infections, and WI-38 was later adopted to increase the cell lines of the lungs.
In 10 to 20 percent of cases of patients with HCoV-229E, symptoms of throat inflammation including headaches, sneezing, restlessness and fever and cough have been observed.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and then put into the serial pathway of the brain of small mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of those who have HCoV-229E, which are not symbolically different from the pathogens of other respiratory tracts, like influenza A viruses and pathogens.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both distributed globally, and they tend to spread more in moderate climates during the winter.
In general, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to a volunteer study in humans, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E cause a mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients show severe respiratory infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia," was first well documented in human history as a global pandemic due to HCoV and is the SARS-CoV etiological agent, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Zhang Dong province, China.
The SARS epidemic that spread to many countries and continents resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of the disease at the viral load range, could increase approximately two secondary cases.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially have symptoms of muscle aches, headaches, fever, dizziness, and colds, followed by shortness of breath, cough, and late-showing symptoms of respiratory distress.
Lymphopinia, an abnormal laboratory test for SARS, has a random function of the liver and some high creatine kinase.
Dispersal loss of ulcers, expansion of epithelial cell, and addition of macrophages in SARS patients are also observed.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the abdominal tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with the cytokine stream, which can be fatal, especially in patients with low immunodeficiency.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open lung biopsy of the relative of the index patient, who traveled from Zhuang Zhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to the research of HCoV.
HCov-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands during late 2004.
Initially, it is found in young children, the elderly, and patients with low immunity with respiratory disease.
In the disease caused by HCoV-BL63, nasal membrane inflammation, chaotic eye, fever and varicose vein inflammation are common.
Another independent study described separating the same virus from a nose sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is about 4.7% in general respiratory disease, and its symptoms are severe at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a stop cough, also known as cramps.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized due to pneumonia and inflammation of the mucous membrane.
The HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with severe asthma pain, with inflammation in the pneumonia and mucous glands obtained from the community.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which have mild respiratory disease, were found worldwide.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are highly compatible with humans and are generally less likely to cause extreme pathogenic disease, although accidents have been reported for unknown reasons, such as the more severe sub-type of HCoV-NL63, the rarest of the rare cases of synesthesia.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit and sustain themselves continuously within humans, they become less severe harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old Saudi patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney disease.
Where most confirmed cases from the lab are found in the Middle East, and sometimes in close contact with secondary outbreaks in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, a secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
Medical descriptions of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which has the characteristics of advanced severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, MERS causes severe kidney failure in a number of patients, which is very unique from MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, 34.4% of the more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have died, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses found in humans.
During mid-December 2019, a large number of pneumonia patients associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection were previously detected in Hubei, Wuhan, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the ongoing outbreak of respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV-2 as a global concern, calling it a public health emergency and calling it COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated dying.
In particular, deaths in these cases in Hubei, China, are 4.2%, while out of this it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients have also been diagnosed.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can increase severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar because of the constant similarity in 82% of high nucleotides, it is a flag of different branches of the pathogenic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of non-symptomatic subjects that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparison and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, the development of HCoVs disease is very similar in duration and duration.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the other four received from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has generally been observed to exhibit the characteristics of its infection during an infection with HCoVs derived from the community, including those with no specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as a SARS-CoV infection, although this ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits interesting characteristics such as HCoVs and SARS-CoVs derived from the community.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it is introduced into humans.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2, like other HCoVs, can be found in fossil samples.
Although at least in some circumstances, future studies remain to explain whether SARS-CoV-2, like the case of SARS-CoV, plays an important role in oral waste transmission.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 will appear seasonally, like the HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenesis, and sustainable spread, will affect the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs obtained from the community, well adapted in humans, cause mild symptoms.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types of old HCoVs can survive the global pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans that cause severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, the HCoVs must be copied into humans in order to adequately counteract the host organism's restriction and adaptation to the origin change.
In this respect, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people it affects, the more likely it is that humans will fully adopt it.
If it is adopted in a good way, then it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other measures that control the infection.
For many years, four CoVs derived from the community have been circulating in the population, causing a common cold in immune-disordered individuals.
These viruses do not need animal reserves.
In contrast, humans from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well and their transmission to humans could not be sustained.
They need to grow and thrive in their animal reserves, and possibly find an opportunity to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more intermediate and enlarged host organisms.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at the moment, it is more capable of transmitting than the HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-derived HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if humans will fully adopt it and it will circulate in humans without any reserves or intermediate host animals.
Before we talk about the source of organisms of HCoVs, it will be better to talk about the evolution, nature, storage, intermediate and expansive determination and their characteristics of host animals of HCoVs.
An animal, if it has a closely related racial association, acts as an evolutionary host organism of HCoVs, sharing a high type of similarity at the level of the sequence of nuclei.
Ethnic viruses are usually well-transformed and non-pathogenic in this host organism.
In the same way, the host shelters the living HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host organisms are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is introduced to humans at or before the introduction of the intermediate host organism, it may not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a source of animal infection and then play the role of a large-scale fast-growing host of human infection in humans.
If HCoVs do not maintain transmission within the intermediate host organism, it will go in the closed path of infection.
In contrast, HCoVs can adapt to medium host organisms and even establish long-term nutrition.
In such a case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the animal's natural reserves.
The data from the pandemic has revealed disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
The investigation of the subsequent non-proliferation reported that the contrasting SARS-CoV lgG among animal traders was higher than in the general population.
The first masked palm civet cats (pegumma larvata) in the live animal market and a raccoon dog have been identified as SARS-CoV-like viruses, similar to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after hitting all the seat beetles in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civet cats from forests or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearing in the live animal market, suggesting that masked palm civet cats may only be acting as an expanding intermediate host organism but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Specifically, since Zhang Zhou's markets contain antibodies to SARS-CoV in 80% of different animals, it is not possible to exclude several small animals that are lactating SARS-CoV's expanding intermediate host organism.
All of these appear to be the closed pathway host organisms of SARS.
The natural host of SARS-CoV has exposed the near-relevant bat CoV, known as SARS-related rhinolophosphamide CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse-tailed bat.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibody and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other beta-CoVs share 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new notion that bats are the hosts of human pathogenesis.
Bats have also been identified with multiple SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), but no one other than a designated WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a specimen of bat propellers was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for bats, seed beetles, and human ACE2 input cells.
Interestingly, the recovered SARS patients of Sierra were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest representative of bat-related SARS-CoV, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
However, despite the extreme similarity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent of SARS-CoV and bats are not the host organisms of SARS-CoV's immediate prevalence.
The strain of MERS-CoV of the same group was analyzed as beta-CoV-HKU4 and beta-CoV-HKU5, phylogenetic analysis.
Beta-CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV, use the same representative receptor, dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) for the entry of the virus.
RNA polymers based on the RNA of MERS identified from Europe and Africa are more closely related to polygenic beta-CoV counterparts.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bet CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, the bat may not be the host of the immediate deposits of MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that in many African countries, like camels in the Middle East, there is a Kobane camel seropositive for the specific ineffective antibody of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated by sputum from the nose of a koban camel, further indicating that camels act as real hosts of the MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that, experimentally, camels infected with MERS-CoV had generally mild symptoms but large-scale virus flows were observed.
In particular, the virus spreads from infected camels not only through the respiratory tract but also through the gastrointestinal tract, which is also the primary route for the virus to flow from bats.
Questions remain, however, as there is no history of multiple cases of MERS confirmed prior to the onset of symptoms associated with camels, including human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species, which shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a 96.2 percent nucleotide-like partner with the isolated CoV RaT13 beet.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is great for assigning parental relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
I mean, the bet SARS-CoV-2 may not be the host of direct deposits of organisms unless a similar bet CoV is found in the future.
Presumably, Hunan's seafood wholesale market, which has many early cases associated with COVID-19 and which is likely to point to animal-to-human transmission, will be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 species sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on the meta-genetic sequence have suggested that a group of at-risk mammals known as pangolins (manus javinicas) may also be a haven for ancestral B-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These nodules share 85-92 percent of the nucleotype sequence with Pangolin CoV genetics SARS-CoV-2.
However, these nucleotide sequences are as closely associated with RaTG13 with approximately 90% identification at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
These files are a subspecies of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which share a 97.4 percent amino acid constant identification, as well as a receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the high degree of consistent genetic range, are more diverse.
Previous studies on the diseased pagolin have reported a combination of viral subtypes from pulp samples, similar to those related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a partial genetic sequence, which is about 86.3% of full-length viral genomes, with different assembly methods and manual protection.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence of direct support for SARS-CoV-2 for the source of pangolins due to the sequential difference between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, penguins and other mammals is yet to be established.
While the best sequencing similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARA-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs have been found in the receptor binding domain, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best broad genetic sequencing similarity.
It is highly speculative that, selected mediation between SARS-CoV-2 and Pegolin SARS-CoV-2 is driven by careful evolution of the advanced similarity in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoVs.
The third wild animal type has proposed a response in favor of replication between beta-CoVs related to penguins SARA-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
The proliferation of large-scale replication synthesis of BTA CoVs, exists as a driving force in evolution.
The direct source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be determined.
In addition to extreme pathogens, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be animal sources.
File genetic evidence suggests that the original sources of both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be bet CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Eplacin Ridge CoV) in North America has shown a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another beta CoV, known as hyposidose/GhanaHum/19/2008, which is known to run in Ghana, on camels is also suspected to be its intermediate host organism.
For clarification, the current knowledge about the animal origin of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
File genetic analysis has provided evidence of cases of mixed transmission of HCoVs in history.
When the domestic livestock HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, a global pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta-Alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-CoV.
Numerous evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in the shared ecosystem, bats may have human contact, not alpacas.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related beetle Alpha CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in beetle, while the alpaca Alpha CoV is caused by respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, the possibility that alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are obtained from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the Rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it's no surprise that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where beta-alpha CoVs work as a genetic reagent of HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels can act as intermediate agents, just like the cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoV bats serve as an excellent example of a mixed algae transmission from camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its initial identification and is also reinforced by subsequent results.
Obviously, bats provide a plentiful pool of virus-types for the transfer of genetic fragments and interspecies and interspecies exchange.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus-promoting'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced in a mountainous camel for decades.
It has been well adapted to these camels that have transitioned from direct host organisms to stable and host organisms of natural reserves.
MERS-CoV maintains a very mild disease and relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Occasionally transmission in humans is an accident, and humans are the closed host organisms of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the role of penguins, if any, is different.
Specifically, penguins are highly pathogenic in BTA-CoVs penguins.
They may be the closed path host organism for SARS-CoV-2 Bta-CoV, which is similar to the civet cats in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or exclude multiple possibilities for the mixed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be the source of SARS-CoV-2, an almost identical virus to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans share an environmental niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, penguins may be one of the fastest middle-host organisms, with the SARS-CoV-2-related virus newly introduced.
Humans get close to the virus through butchering and hunting food.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, the replication and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can occur in the third species that contact both bats and penguins.
The search for the source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the variety of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major factors by the viral in crossing several types of barriers.
First, the RNA copy has a relatively higher variability rate.
Compared to other single stranded RNA viruses, the determined change rate of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" while the average change rate per year on each site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of Novel host organisms to CoV, is 10-4.
CoVs have proof-reading external bonuses, with deletions resulting in more variables, attention-seeking, even inconsistent.
Interestingly, the new Clio-Tide analog remdesivir is known to suppress the replication of CoVs through the inhibition of RNA polymerase based on this outer bloat and RNA.
Remdesivir is the most intelligent agent to be tested as a contraceptive SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of its host organisms.
Also, often times when CoVs can't adapt well to host organisms, it has a higher conversion rate.
Compared to the highest change rate of SARS-CoV, the well-adapted SARA-CoV-2 in humans appears to have a lower change rate.
Probably, it has already adapted to another host organism close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a cobbin camel, applies.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that increased genetics will make the vaccine and antivirals effective against SARS-CoV-2 immediately.
Second, the genes in CoVs show the use of additional formforms in genetic modification for large RNA changes and replication, thus increasing the likelihood of mutual evolution of mixed alveolars, which is beneficial for the appearance of novel coVs when the conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by coding multiple unique reading frames and lattice functions to the 3' end of the genus.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection," CoVs often randomly switch to RNA templates.
During the replication of the CoV RNA, in the host organism acting as a mixture, the dor is frequently altered.
To develop new CoVs, the full length of the highly homologous and subgenuine RNAs can be replicated.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural combination of genes has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bet SL-CoV and bet CoV-HKU9.
The transmission of the virus to host organisms
In addition to the above three viral factors, viral interaction with the host organism receptor is an important factor in effective and mixed algae transmission.
With this, the reinfection synthesis of SARS-CoV is taken as a common example, which gave evidence of positive selection during the mixed anaerobic transition.
In addition to the comparative analysis of the loneliness of SARS-CoVs in humans and civets, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly shrinking in various host organisms, especially with the change of the receptor binding domain of S lymphoma.
In general, the receptor binding domain in the S lattice of CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is strongly selected through the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 piece is the 318th to 510th amino acid, which is bound to its receptors for human ACE2 as well as viral entry.
The ACE2 receptors for the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain are able to identify different animals, including bats, sea cats, rats and raccoons, which allow for the mixing of the virus.
In fact, only the remains of 6 amino acids in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in virally isolated human and sedative cats, 4 of them in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
There are K479N and S487T variations in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, which can enhance the interaction of the nodule with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can prove to be important substitutions for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy, that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S lymphoma indicates that human ACE2 may change its S lymphoma's essential attachment.
Indeed, a study of abrasive electron microscope is pointing to this association being -10 to -20 times greater than the association between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV S latency.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another sub-receptor will be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can calculate the successful adaptation of these CoVs after a mixed algae transfer from their host animals to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, HCoV is monitored by means of binding factors, depending on another host organism, and the result of a mixed algae transfer.
The spread of these host larvae between humans and host organisms with natural reserves of HCoVs, such as bats, a camel, and mice, can hinder the transmission of mixed algae.
HCoVs are the binding factors of an angry host organism's dependence on and disruptive host organisms for a successful mixed algae transfer.
In this regard, the identity and characteristics of this important part of the virus's interaction with host organisms remain to be determined molecularly.
The host organism's dependence and neutralized broad genetic testing of binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from the use of CRISPR's cutting-edge technology.
Emission of Novel HCoVs: Back to Zero Ground
The diversity of bet CoVs provides plenty of opportunities for the emission of novel HCoVs.
In this respect, beta-CoVs act as a reservoir of the genetics of an HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic replication also accelerate the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or wastage of a nootropic coding gene has the potential to rapidly change the viral phenotype.
In supporting latitudes of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related beta viruses were isolated but found to be different from ORF8 latitudes.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, strains isolated from SARS-CoV have been found to have the characteristic of eliminating 29 nucleotides.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and this is a favorable change that promotes the transfer of ORF8 into host organisms.
In addition, there is a history of possible replication with the sequence of SARS-CoV alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of RNA polymers based on RNA replication were identified as small regions.
The locations of the relays were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in a camel in Saudi Arabia, has experienced recurrence events between different sequences.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, replication events have also been observed in other CoVs, in which HCoVs replicate with other animal CoVs with their non-replicating genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to undeclared changes in viral genetics, possibly avoiding selective stress, such as the host's immune system, as a result of getting rid of the virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, causing the deletion of two nucleotides.
Although the retention of ORF4 in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E can be observed, the alpaca displays a single nucleotide entry of the alpha-CoV, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of Novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in the host organisms of their reserves.
When bats are infected with CoVs, a non-symptomatic or mild symptoms is detected, indicating a correlation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are well adapted to anatomy and physical CoVs.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the dynamic pathology through CoVs.
In addition, bats are suppressed due to low levels of exposure to natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and large histocompatibility complex class I saliva.
Furthermore, reactivating the high levels of the high-meta-bolk activity-generating oxygen type of bats (ROS) by suppressing the replication of both CoVs, and by influencing the proof readings through the X-rays to create the highly pathogenic virus strains, when a new host organism is introduced, is selected.
More pathogenic CoV strains can be produced through replication, which can lead to the development of nodule or laminate properties for adaptation of host organisms.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reservoir host organisms such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without the immune response of a powerful host organism.
In this, the secrets of why unsymptomatic pathogens appear and what causes severe cases in human infections are hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokine storm, which, from a powerful immune response, damages the lungs more severely.
On the other hand, in an unsymptomatic pathogen, the immune response has been de-capped from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of uncoordinated immune response in the treatment of SARA-CoV-2 has a beneficial effect.
The reaction of interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the organization of the type I interferon should be beneficial.
In addition, the inflammation function of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
For this reason, it may be beneficial to prevent inflammation with NLRP3 MCC950 in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emissions follow the general idea of emerging through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a bat-beta-CoV has been found to share 95 per cent of the new CT-CoV with SARS-CoV, there is a CT-CoV that is sharing 96 per cent of the CT-CoV similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While suts and other animals in the market have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin B-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that pengolin B-CoVs are either acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or can contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have come back to light.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has radically changed our views on animal origins and animal deposits of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence suggests that the source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bats and that it has been transmitted to humans through an intermediate host organism.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection is caused by the contact between humans and civets in markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eliminated by closing meat markets and killing civets.
For this reason, in view of the discovery of multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2-associated pangolins, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission from animals.
However, future investigations are yet to determine when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through penguins and other mammals.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has long been present in a mountainous camel.
For locals, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather, and wool, as well as the main means of transportation.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So as to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in China's markets, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, along with other measures to control the infection, a sensible approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS for camels.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, it can cause the emergence of a new genetic variant.
CoVs of species and animals are circulating in the forest.
Specifically, bat CoVs with capacity in animals are very diverse.
As a result of the emission of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to develop and regenerate.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some places in China must abandon the food culture.
With trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They live in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many characteristics that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, chances of contact with human bats and other wildlife species can be reduced.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts, which will be effective in preventing the transmission of the disease from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, by staying away from the ecological niche of the natural reservoirs of the virus that transmits diseases from animals to humans, the viruses that transmit diseases from animals to humans can be more effectively prevented.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being a source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if the bat transmits an racial virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it will be interesting to see how bats and pangolins can share the same environmental power under the same conditions.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third milking animal acts as a real intermediate representative, it will have to explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and penguins.
Finally, because many other dairy animals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and testing should be conducted for infection.
If bats, penguins, or other mammals are mammals, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent viruses, which are almost identical, will be identified in its natural representatives.
The continuation of research in this field will explain the evolutionary journey of SARS-CoV-2 in animals as well as having a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to renew the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published the Quick Advisory Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, providing our experience and a good reference for fighting the global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experience in our awareness and knowledge; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, saying that "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" provide the most up-to-date diagnostic standards in accordance with the final guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh Edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, now officially known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is known as severe respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a fast advisory guide and it was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, it is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experience in our awareness and knowledge; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), its total of seven issues were released from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in its context.
Now that our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., they have suggested an easy scoring based on their medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We are grateful to them for their hard work and for their generosity.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the 7th issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis is required by combining any one characteristic of the history of the epidemic with two items of medical explanation to confirm the suspected case, or by combining three items of medical explanation without a clear history of the epidemic:
History of epidemics: (1) Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) Infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2; (2) Infectious cases from the onset of the onset of the disease; or (2) Infectious cases from the onset of the onset of SARS-CoV-2; and (3) Wuhan city and surrounding areas.
Medical descriptions: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with conceptual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing the number of white blood cells in the early stage of normal, kneeling, or low lymphocyte count.
Pathogenic or serological evidence should diagnose a confirmed case with one of the following items: (1) to be positive for the PCR test in real-time, lG-positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) to be positive for the lG-positive phase of the lG-positive phase of the LG-2; (2) to be specific for the LG-positive phase of the LG-CoV-2 and to the entire viral genetic sequence of the SARS-serum.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) counts.
Pathogen detection in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and serological evidence was added in the seventh issue.
Test-based editing is underway to find a kit that detects more nucleic acid in order to quickly diagnose the confirmed quality, as well as to take blood samples including the respiratory tract that enhances the availability of various samples, and to help bring positive results of specific antibodies.
In addition, there are many other evidences that remind us of caution from traditional symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have ranked the person without medical symptoms in "low risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in further medical practice and studies.
As a result, we hope for more direct evidence to come and demand that readers submit their feedback.
To diagnose "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we advise them to track and comply with the latest guidelines in their home countries.
In order to offer help, our team updates our guide in a timely manner.
Five new deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported in Bangladesh, the highest in a day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of today, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemic Diseases, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of recorded cases includes 114 active cases and 33 recoveries that remain at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjedi Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mir Jedi, two of the cases were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic a pandemic.
A hospital official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif-ur-Rehman, the director of the Bengali anti-bad title, who was taken care of at Materi Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Abed al-Qader said that public transport will be closed for a long time from this coming week under the initial plan.
Initially, the closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities -- medical equipment, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
On March 8, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than a million people globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease that appears to be caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia.
By Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries that has so far been free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases after 10:00 a.m. on April 4 at Central Europe time(0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded, including 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 Americans had died from the coronavirus infection by Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to the Russians would continue until April 30 without working.
Portugal's parliament voted in favour of a 15-day extension of the national emergency; the vote was passed in 215 votes in favour of it, a 10-point withdrawal, and a vote against it.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina for a full day: earlier, the curfew was effective from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.

Reduce the amount of toilet paper in Australian stores in each transaction.
On Sundays and Saturdays, Australian stores chains Wall Worth and Quills reduced the purchase restrictions of toilet paper in all stores nationwide by up to two and a pack per transaction.
ALDI also introduced a package limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on the checkouts, and the chain's Facebook back pages.
Due to the fear of COVID-19, buyers were reported to have it stored in the event of a need for self-isolation of people.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for delivery at home to a pack on each order.
The changes came in line with the four-pack restrictions on each of Woolworth and Coal's last introduced transactions on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Quills, in a media release on March 8, said that with the ban of four packs in one place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery," and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictable."
According to a spokesman for Woolworth, last week's sales "significantly increased."
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number allowed last week to two packs.
To mitigate the shortage, Quilts ordered larger packets from suppliers and increased the delivery continuity, Woolworth ordered additional storage, while ADLI stocked for special early availability on planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Association of Australian Retailers, said retailers try to increase storage, but the ban on truck delivery times by the local council has made it difficult.
They are in addition to increasing production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after a storage discount, some stores will not be able to run on specific Wednesdays.
Dr. Gary Martymer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores fill up storage every night.
He said that toilet tissue paper is a big thing, due to which it has a small amount of storage, and, when sold, leaves a wide space of shelf empty, which gives a sense of acute shortage.
Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News, Coils and Woolworth's review [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitizers can go [buy], and if they're in quantity, maybe you can reduce the panic.
The tissue paper maker of a crepe-giving recyclable toilet said last Wednesday that they would be without storage.
According to the news.com.au report, Kimberly Clark, who makes the tissues of the Clint Eastwood, and Solaris who makes the sorbet, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a property buy-and-sell site, said some people selling properties in Melbourne offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction, when some auctions were held when buyers had time due to a long weekend on the occasion of World Workers' Day.
The eight-page instalments were included in the Thursday issue of the Daily Darwin, NT News, which meant cutting them down and using them as toilet tissue paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were actually reluctant to impose restrictions, about which they said they had no plans to introduce a ban on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that there is a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry items, handwashers and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, the purchase of the British supermarket was observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 — the coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 — is a global pandemic.
Although the epidemiological epidemiology refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to mention how dangerous certain cases are, the World Health Organization stressed the need for action by governments.
All countries can change the face of the pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and activate their people in response.
We are deeply concerned by the two dimensions of the disease due to its speed and severity, and the worrying extent of the carbohydrates against it.
According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
"In addition to the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the beginning to the global outbreak," he said in his remarks published on CNN in February.
"We've never seen a pandemic that's so far ahead of the coronavirus pandemic," Ghebreyesus said.
"We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he continued.
The new status of the pandemic came in January after the World Health Organization announced its decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The important thing is that it is leading to further destruction."
The Associated Press reported that the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 126,000 as of Thursday, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which causes severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and declared as a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and identified as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
In China, the mortality rate is 4%, while globally it rises from 13.04% in Algeria to 18.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include symptoms of pneumonia and severe difficulty in breathing.
The duration from the appearance of the disease to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment. The recommended precautions include handwashing, mouthwash, distance from other people while growing up, and self-monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect they are affected.
The authorities around the world support travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls, and the closure of facilities.
The pandemic has disrupted many global social economies, delayed religious, political, and cultural events, and led to widespread shortages of goods due to shopping malpractice.
Schools and universities in 193 countries closed either nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population.
Misconceptions about the virus spread online and there were cases of prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South East Asia, and people of color and ethnicity, where virus cases have increased.
Due to the low arrivals and the closure of large industries, the air density and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China, reported a collection of pneumonia cases for an unknown reason on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The majority of these cases are from the Hunan seafood wholesale market, and therefore it is believed that the virus comes from a breed of animal diseases.
The virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person who did not show any symptoms of the disease was a person who fell ill on December 1, 2019.
Two-thirds of the initial incidents reported in December 2019 were related to markets.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post in an unconfirmed report recommended that a 55-year-old man in Hubei province on November 17, 2019 may be the first-ever case - on February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although the number of cases in China is decreasing, the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea has increased.
It can also reduce the number of cases, especially in people with common symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of global cases, UK chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance measured that 60% of the UK's population would be affected by the pandemic before becoming an effective crowd.
According to the government protocol, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and their results have been confirmed to be positive.
As of March 23, no other country had tested 3% of its population, and many countries have adopted an official policy not to test only people with mild symptoms, such as those in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
In China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients were not detected until January 23, and this unregistered patient was the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate number (R0) of primary re-production for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people who are infected with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who don't have it, the duration from the appearance of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths in China are in people over the age of 60, and 75% of people with pre-existing diseases, including heart disease and diabetes, the official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic is usually based on deaths that have tested positive for COVID as per government protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 can be many more than that, as these deaths do not include people who die without a test - for example at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID-19 deaths by x4-5.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "we know [the number of reported deaths] is low," confirming reports of fewer deaths in the U.S. This type of mitigation reports are often found during the first nine deaths since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside Earth China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred on February 14 in France.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had occurred outside of mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories have reported deaths from each continent except the South Pacific. A number of joint measures are being used to determine deaths.
These numbers vary from region to region over time, and are affected by testing, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, time after the initial outbreak of the disease, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, Abbey has a global mortality and incidence rate of 6.0% as of April 10, 2020 (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The proportion of cases and deaths in China (from the onset of the disease to the onset of symptoms as on January 10, 2020) has fallen from 17.3% (from the onset of the disease to the onset of the disease as on February 10, 2020) to 0.7% (from the onset of the disease to the onset of the disease).
These numbers are not for a particular time period and are for a particular population from infection to the final solution of the case.
Many experts have tried to count that number for a particular population.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall mortality rate from the infection in this global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate corresponds to the results of the first various COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that this pandemic can be controlled.
The height and duration of the pandemic are different and uncertain depending on the location.
"Unexamined, multiple outbreaks generally grow like surface elevations and begin to come down later when the disease no longer hosts," said McKee Bonnie of Penn State University.
But it's impossible to say exactly when this will happen, and there's a reasonable plan at the moment."
Zong Nanshan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, stressed that "it could end by June" if all countries are encouraged to follow its advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus by the World Health Organization.
On March 17, Adam Charsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue to circulate for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)."
"I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus — completely eradicated — because it's easily transmissible — will turn into a seasonal disease, and will continue to come back every year," said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The death toll of the return will depend on the extent to which the creation of the population is reduced and its variability.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unpleasant and people infected can be without symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include a sore throat, bulging throat (bullying), the cessation of the ability to breathe, coughing, pain in the joints, sore throats, headaches, colds, ulcers, bleeding in the anus, diarrhea and acute respiratory ailment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that a person may suffer from diarrrhea or blue jaun.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms: difficulty in breathing, frequent chest pain or pressure, sudden headaches, difficulty in waking up, and numbness of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some of these infected people may be without symptoms, they may be treated as confirmed patients without medical symptoms, so the researchers recommend that people who have been in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to stay away from infection.
The proportion of unsymptomatic diseases in China ranges from a few numbers to 44 percent.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually covers one to 14 days; it usually lasts five days; for example, in a situation of uncertainty, the sense of smell in people with COVID-19<0x2B> was initially eliminated in 30% of people, which later decreased to 15% of people.
The extent to which this disease is transmitted is also very clear to the general public.
It is believed that the disease is initially caused by close connections and is caused by small droplets that are produced when in close contact with the anus, chin, or mouth; where the distance in close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that seedlings can grow from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) without dandruff.
Few people have advised that the virus can also be transmitted from small droplets that stay in the air for an extended period of time, which can cause respiratory droplets when exhaled, including during conversations, although the virus is usually not in the air.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby, or possibly enter the pavement while breathing.
Certain medical procedures, such as inhalation tubes and artificial mouth-to-mouth inhalation (CPR), can exhale respiratory moisture and thus spread it in the air.
It can also occur when someone touches the affected surface and then spreads it to their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it can also be removed from the face, the risk is very low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a body-expelled substance, which is highly contagious for three days before the onset of symptoms, although it may be spread before symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Since people can test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that the transmission of the disease is possible before the onset of effective symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the lab, where there are no symptoms of the disease in the past, but in some countries, there has been an unexplained transmission of symptoms during investigations into contacts.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can usually infect two to three people - the virus can survive for hours at different levels for days.
Specifically, the virus was detected on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature, with pets and other animals testing positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, as British authorities advise handwashing after contact with animals, as they do when contacting other levels that have been chewed by an infected person.
Severe tuberculosis symptoms coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, previously isolated from three people with pneumonia who are linked to a group of severe respiratory illnesses in the city of Wuhan.
All the properties of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding physical coronavirus--outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated with gorilla soap, which dissolves its protective molecule.
It is believed to be caused by animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is relative, relative to the beta-coronavirus (relative B) inherited from the two strains of the chimpanzee in the subfamily, the family of the beta-coronavirus.
At the overall genome level, it is 96% similar to the other bat coronavirus sample (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino acid was found in parts of the genome sequence in humans and pangolin viruses.
Comparing the full genome to the present day, it has been found that 92% of the genetic material is shared in the penguins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that penguins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Temporary diagnosis of infection with the virus can be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmation from infected fluids or ICT X-rays is ultimately carried out through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
In a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, it was reported that CT is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its reflective characteristics dominated other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening or as a first-of-its-kind test for COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is done on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are usually available from a few hours to a few days.
Usually, this test is done through an infi-root, although the infi-root can also be used in the throat - many laboratories and companies are also in the form of an antibody test.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to allow it to be widely used.
A serological test has been developed in the United States by SALEX, which has been approved for emergency use only in certified laboratories.
In the characteristic of reflecting on radiographs and computed tomography (CTs) of those who have symptoms of the disease, asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities, and absent overflows.
The Italian Radiology Society is building an international online database of image results of certified events.
Due to overlapping with other infections, such as adenoviruses, the identification of COVID-19 imaging without PCR approval is limited.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR, which showed that although the mirroring for infection is less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, despite the suggestion that it should be considered as a screening device in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based billboard neural networks were created to detect the viral imagery, both through radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of this disease include maintaining a holistic personal hygiene, keeping your hands hygienic, touching your eyes, nose or mouth without touching your hands, and putting your hands and feet in a trash can.
People who are already infected with this infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease are also recommended - many countries have restricted travel or prevented non-essential travel by other countries, or have banned travel to areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading to the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within society, and people in some communities do not know how or where they have been infected. Health care providers, who are concerned about being infected with the disease, are advised to take standard precautions to prevent contact and ophthalmology.
For this purpose, the government's use of the chancellor's data via mobile phones has raised concerns about privacy, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for this type of surveillance to be restricted.
As of April 7, 2020, if various mobile apps have implemented it or advised for voluntary use, more than a dozen groups are working on a privacy friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to get the user's location from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he or she has approached someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings circulating regarding the prevention of infection are not effective; for example, pouring water into the nose and snoring with a moisturizer is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many companies are working on one.
It is recommended to use hand sanitizer to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to wash their hands with soap for up to 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dry; before getting old; and when someone cleans the nose, take anesthesia, or take cheenic.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus is killed by gorilla soap when its protective circuit breaks.
The CDC further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in terms of volume, which is when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces should also be cleaned in a number of ways (stainless steel surfaces should be stopped in front of a disinfectant for a minute), consisting of 62-71 ethanol, 50-100 asopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% pyridine.
Other methods, such as benzalconium chloride and chromohexidary gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or certified COVID case appears at a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas i.e. offices, toilets, shared spaces, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by sick people, should be cleared of germs.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth with a twisted tongue or tissue while coughing and sneezing and immediately destroy such tissue.
The suggestion of wearing a surgical mask is for those who may be affected, because wearing a mask limits both the size and distance of the drops emitted by the affected person, when he speaks, takes a cheek, and performs anaesthesia.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus expert at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce people's chances of touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if washed without proper hand hygiene."
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing masks for healthy people only if their health is at high risk, as they are treating people who are diagnosed with COVID-19, although they recognize that wearing masks prevents people from touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask - China has specifically recommended that healthy people from the public wear a disposable medical mask, especially when it is likely to go near other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks using public transport means or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to wear masks in their homes and give them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks or going to public without their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when visiting public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone should wear a mask when entering the shops.
Israel has asked all residents to wear a face mask when going out in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, will also require passengers to wear masks in buses running between trains and cities from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while at home, it is also advised to make masks for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) involves acts of disease control aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These methods include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing practices while at home, avoiding incursions, not receiving greetings, and staying physically away from each other.
Many governments are implementing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The U.S. government agencies and health organizations quickly reduced the number of gatherings from 250 people (where there is no known case of COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people, which was later reduced to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Elderly people and people who are sick, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, obesity, obesity, high blood pressure, and other health complications, so that they could be "cleared" in the beginning of the 2020 transition period.
With the term social distancing, people began to feel that they should be completely isolated from the world, rather than being encouraged to communicate with other people in alternative ways.
They also recommend that they only have sex with their partner who has no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected to be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation, and many governments have mandated or recommended that the entire population living in an affected area should go into self-quarantine.
The strictest self-quarantine prescriptions have been issued for those in a serious risk group.
People who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and who have recently traveled to a country or region where there is widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible disclosure.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic are prevention, control, or pressure and mitigation.
The containment strategy is formulated in the early stages of the pandemic and aims to find and isolate the infected people, introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinate them so that the disease is not spread to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, the effort enters the phase of widespread mitigation: measures are taken to reduce its spread and the impact on the health care system and society are minimized.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects, both should be avoided at the same time.
More stringent measures need to be put in place to suppress the pandemic so that the pandemic can be eradicated by locking down at least 1 percent of the pandemic's basic spread, part of an effort to reduce the spread of the infectious disease, which is called adhesives to the pandemic's edge.
It reduces the concern for health services, which are being overtaken, and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment to be discovered.
Non-governmental measures that can manage the pandemic include precautionary measures such as hand-washing, wearing of face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures such as stricter measures such as stricter quarantines, stricter quarantines, stricter quarantines, stricter measures such as school closures and cancellations of mass gatherings; including community engagement to encourage people to take such measures.
Other countries have taken a number of different measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has conducted extensive screenings and local quarantines and issued warnings about the movement of the affected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to those affected who have self-quarantineed and those who have not done so have been fined spring.
Taiwan's production of face masks and authorized storage of medical supplies have increased, and similarities between the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (the spread of the epidemic is declining but not ending) and stress (the rise of the global pandemic) are major challenges.
Excessive mitigation policies can lead to a rise in health demand by up to two-thirds and mortality rates by up to half, but in turn can lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overrun.
Pressure can be preferred as a transfer, but it should continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is first) otherwise it will return to early recovery when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the global pandemic cause social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including experiments on existing drugs.
The use of anti-cold medications, drinking too much water and rest helps to alleviate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygenation, vaccinations in the veins and breathing aids may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Many of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "traditional and gurillo-picking" can bring relief to SARS-CoV-19 diseases.
The increase in the capacity and adaptation of health care providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key step in responding to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization's Regional European Union Office have issued guidelines for change of resources at various stages for hospitals and primary health centers, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test for COVID-19, when possible, to respond to arbitrary procedures, to isolate and isolate the number of COVID-19 positive patients, and through personnel training.
There are many theories as to where the first event (i.e., zero patient) would have originated.
The first case of Novel Coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei began to gradually increase.
Most of these incidents occur in the wholesale sea market in Hunan, where live animals are also sold, and one theory is that the virus comes from this type of animal; in other words, it comes from the breed of animal diseases.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central Wuhan hospital warned their patients about a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of them, including Dr. Lee Vinelag, were warned by the police to spread false rumours and another, I-Fen, was blamed by his superiors for spreading rumours.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public news release on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
By early January, Wuhan's health authorities had been informed of sufficient cases of unfamiliar pneumonia to order an investigation, doubling the number of cases in the early stages of the outbreak in nearly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, playing a key role in China's transition to the new year as Wuhan was the main interchange of transportation means and rail.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had already had symptoms of the disease.

The pandemic came at a time when China's New Year's eve is a major travel season.
Numerous events, which were attended by excessive influx, were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year's Eve celebrations, in which autonomous personal companies also closed their shops and tourist centers, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many festivals and tourist centers, including the Forbidden City and traditional dome fairs in Beijing, were closed to avoid crowds.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipal and regional officials extended the New Year's Eve festivities until February 10, directing most workplaces not to re-open until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to the contagious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, under which schools were closed until March and New Year's celebrations were canceled.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail sales in North America and the Middle East dropped 50-60%.
This reduced the number of pedestrians walking to shopping centers by 33-43% in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall operators have imposed additional measures, such as additional cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to test buyers' temperatures, and cancellation of events, according to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic peaked in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China had lost their jobs.
Nearly 300 million rural migrants in remote areas of China's provinces have either fled or fled to Hubei province, leaving more than 10 million Americans unemployed in March 2020 and seeking government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus disease could cause a loss of 47 million dollars in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Lockdown in India has left more than 90,000 workers unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment jobs and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany gave their workers a wage on a government-backed short-term work scheme called Corzerbet.
Germany's short-term compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
Globally, the arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely impacted by the pandemic, which has had a significant impact on the actions of individuals - both in terms of employment and autonomy.
Organizations of the Department of Fine Arts and Fine Arts attempted to maintain their mission (often through public collaboration) to provide access to society's cultural heritage, protect its employees and the public, and, as far as possible, help artists.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues and other cultural institutions across the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and events were cancelled or postponed.
One of the most recent and rapid failures of the disease is religious services, important events in the cathedral and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and cancellations of fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Happy Saturday in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian Lent season, was canceled.
Many pastors advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday worship; some churches began broadcasting church worship on radio, live TV or online, while others were worshiping sons in cars.
As Roman Catholic priests in Rome closed their churches and cathedrals, and St. Peter's Square was empty of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and circuses.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic and closed mosques, while Saudi Arabia closed the entry of foreign visitors and also closed the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic, since World War II, has caused significant disruption in the calendar of the world's sport.
Major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2019-20 UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA, the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be rescheduled from 2020 onwards, but will not be canceled until after the summer of 2021."
Due to this, many gamblers have moved online, and the new sign-ups of many online gambling sites have increased significantly. The entertainment industry has also been particularly affected, with many music groups postponing or cancelling their concerts.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many artists have found ways to work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming events, and pass it on to others, or continue to create web-based "family" so that fans can perform, spread it, and advertise their work.
Online, many memes based on the idea of coronavirus have spread as many turn to humor and procrastination in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Chinese and East Asians, Europe, the United States, and other countries where the epidemic has been exacerbated, have seen a lot of prejudice, xenophobia, fear and racism from outsiders.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion, and opposition, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific.
According to reports in February (when most of the cases were confined to China), Chinese people have been exposed to racist sentiments in various groups around the world, which deserve to be claimed in return for the virus.
There are also anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.
Many of the residents in Wuhan and Hubei have reported their differences on a regional basis.
For the Chinese, both on and offline, and those in areas affected by the virus have been supported.
After the outbreak and spread to other countries, Italy, the first country in Europe to experience the outbreak of COVID-19, could face suspicions and fears of aliens, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese nationals from entering their countries.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has become trending on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported incidents of racism-based abuse and insult.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," critics have called the term racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhar.
Students coming from northern India, which borders China, and studying in India's major cities, have experienced harassment related to the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, stated that China had destroyed nature and "this is the reason why God has avenged them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese ambassador to Calcutta, calling it "misguided" since the pandemic in China has fueled feelings of racism from non-Chinese settlers, foreigners called "foreign trash" which is "to settle."
Many newspapers have removed them to cover some or all of their coronavirus.
Many scientific content publishers made scientific articles about the spread available to everyone.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to the server before publication, such as bioRixiv.

The laboratory test for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes procedures that detect the presence and presence of viruses that produce antibodies as a result of the infection.
RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (serology) can also be used to detect and monitor populations.
Antibodies tests show how many people had the disease, including those with so few symptoms to report or no symptoms.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact rate of disease mortality and the level of immunity in a population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, as of Abhi Marge 2020, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a big difference in how many tests have been conducted between countries.
The death toll due to this change is highly disputed in the report, which is likely to be higher in some countries.
Tests on breath samples can be achieved in a variety of ways using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), including nasopharyngeal swab or bulk samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
The PT-PCR test, which is carried out in bulk of the throat, is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, when it begins to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears in the throat.
For those affected by the second week of testing, alternately sample material can be used from deep airways through a suction catheter or cough-up material (thook).
The first PCR tests will be developed using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the charity's location in Berlin in January 2020, which became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
The BGI Group in China was one of the first companies in the world to have its clinical divisions in 2019 from China's National Medical Product Administration (NMCA) to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) approved the emergency use of SARS-CoV-2 detection kits.
One out of three tests in the older version of the test ketone did not yield correct results due to poor chemical interactions, and less than 100 samples could be collected in a day throughout February 2020 due to disruptions to tests on the CDC in Atlanta.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to conduct tests.
The test, approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the authority of emergency use, was launched by US business laboratories in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 across the country.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available across the country by March 9, 2020.
Quantity limits have not been announced; sample collection and further processing should be in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 Test State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR was developed and developed.
The test was registered with the Federal Service for Health Services on February 11, 2020, according to a May Clinic report on March 12, 2020, it has prepared the test for detection of COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of 3.5 hours, i.e., in about 12 hours intervals of a 24-hour machine.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Holographic, LabCorp, and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid likewise obtained the EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, thanks to this method, positive results are achieved in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott is expected to increase the number of making machines to 50,000 tests per day, a test that uses monoclonal antibodies that are specifically limited to the nucleoside protein (N-protein) that can deliver up to 20 rapid test results of the novel coronavirus, with the hopes being developed in Taiwan.
The final words of the review, written in March 2020, are: "At the initial stage, the diagnosis of chest radiography is of no importance, but the presence of CT computed tomography is possible before symptoms appear."
The general characteristics of CT are two-way multi-layered grouted glass foaming, which includes the overlapping and overlapping of the rear section.
As the disease progresses, full domination, crazy smoothness and stability develops.
Wuhan, where it was the world's worst pandemic, in a study comparing PCR and CT, suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, has many characteristics similar to pneumonia and the stages of the disease.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The immune response to infections, including IgM and IgG, is to produce antibodies.
They can be used to detect infections in people who have had symptoms for 7 days, to determine their immunity, and for those who are under strict surveillance, to be tested at the Central Laboratory (CLT) or the Center for Safety Testing (PoCT).
In many clinical laboratories, high-producing automated systems will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will be stagnant at the rate of production for each system.
For CLT, a single sample of blood is usually used, although many samples can be used to capture the strength of the immune system.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by piercing on the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notifications to the agency and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is faster than traditional PCR for detection of RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection, and in early April, the UK found that none of the test kits purchased were suitable for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that suspects can stay at home, "Emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient," they will stop it, send it back to the patient for a diagnosis, and get the result after a medical examination. The NHS in the UK has announced that if these suspects end up at home, they will start a scheme to test the cases on an experimental basis.
Thanks to drive-thru centers, South Korea has conducted more rapid and more tests than any other country, with the National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians in Germany saying on March 2 that it has the capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day in normal settings and 10,700 tests will be conducted last week.
When it comes to health care, health insurance costs.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
The test drives were offered in several major cities as of March 19.
The number of tests conducted in Germany as of 26 March 2020 is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, a total of 483,295 samples will be tested by the week 12/2020, and in the current week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples have been tested positive for SARS-CoV (6%) in the 2-day trial.

Wuhan's laboratory methodology was immediately adopted by Hua-Yan laboratories located in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, Origami Assays has released open-source multi-element designs that can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients with just 93 attempts.
As of March, shortages and inadequate amounts of Regents have become a hindrance to mass testing in the EU and the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have scanned the prototype protocol, which limits the samples to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to produce RNA genomes or chromosomes for further testing.
Such a drive-through capability and benefited from both Grooup 42 and BGI (based on their "HUO-Yan" emergency detection devices) developed for large populations.
The laboratory, which was set up in 14 days, carried out thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to operate on such a large scale in addition to China.
Various testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German structure for low-income countries, who do not have the resources to make cuts.
The German synthesis, published on January 17, 2020, was not available until January 28, leading to concerns over the quality of testing kits in China and the United States in the early days of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide cuts despite recommendations and demands from health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the large supply of South Korea's testing led to a decrease in the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In recent years, the South Korean government has developed testing capabilities in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for strengthening testing programs to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing testing demand and halting hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and straining supply of wound-cleaning sebum and chemical interactions.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kits.
The cuts made by the CDC in the United States were "crazy," the government then removed office barriers that prevented private testing.Spain bought cuts from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained to him that the reason for the wrong results is to not properly use defects or cuts in collecting samples.
Spain's Ministry of Health said the wrong test kits would be removed and replaced with a test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy, with 80% of the state's purchases from China giving false results.
Atskara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the cuts that Turkey bought from China had "a very high rate of error" and that they were "not used."The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The test showed good results in the case of a positive result, in an attempt to identify people who had been quarantined and those who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients.
In the Italian town of Vo, where Italy's first COVID-19 death occurred, researchers from the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
About half of the people who were tested had no symptoms, and all of the detected cases were quarantined.
Due to the limited travel to specific human groups, the new infection cases have been completely eliminated.
Due to extensive contact with the infected, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic had far less impact on Singapore than on the developed countries of the world, where there were no strict restrictions such as forcibly shutting down restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay confined to their homes, but schools reopened on time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also overcome the pandemic through strict measures such as tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not more stringent lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have tested higher mortality rates have lower mortality rates, probably because they have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
The WHO has recommended that countries that do not have the ability to test and have national laboratories dealing with COVID-19 send their first five positive and 10 negative COVID-19 samples to WHO's 16 reference laboratories for verification testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below relates to a country's testing policy.
The country that tests only those who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive tests than the country where you test all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, will take all of them equally.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand health, the purpose of this process is to cleanse your hands from dirt, lubricants, germs, or other unnecessary substances.
On some "essential occasions," frequent hand washing with soap a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and diarrhea enter the mouth's pathways.
People may also suffer from respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common ulcers, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
In a day those five essential occasions when washing hands with soap are very important: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before and after eating and before and after preparing food, or after touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, handwashing can also be done with ash.
Before, during and after meals.
before and after the patient's illness.
Replace the diaper or after cleaning the child using the toilet.
After cleaning the nose with force, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the medical procedure to be in accordance with the principles of hygiene.
Hand washing or medical care before taking the medication can stop or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of medical hand washing is to cleanse the hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or spread the disease.
This is especially true for people who are in the food or medical field, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decrease in the mortality rate of children born at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving the habit of washing hands significantly improves height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can lead to a reduction in child mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce deaths due to these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the mortality rate from diarrhea incidence by one-third, and can be compared with the supply of clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap can reduce the mortality rate by up to 48%. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million children's deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, changing the habit of hand-washing before and after meals can save more lives than using a vaccine or medical intervention, half of the deaths due to diarrhea and a quarter of the deaths due to severe respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually part of other hygiene items, such as water, drainage and sanitation programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against diseases that are transmitted directly from the joints.
One small disadvantage of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin drying.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can cause skin irritation, which is commonly found in people with a medical condition.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a sign of over-compensation (OCD).
There are five delicate occasions in a day when it is very important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease through the mouth and mouth: after using the bathroom (piss or cook), after cleaning from the bottom of the baby (change of diaper), before feeding the baby, before and after eating and after preparing food. Before and after or after cooking meat, fish or chicken.
Other occasions when it is necessary to properly wash hands in order to avoid disease transmission include: before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or nosebleeding; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after handling the litter.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing is low.
According to a 2015 study in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap, the highest rate in Saudi Arabia is 97 per cent; the United States is among the least likely to have a miscarriage, 77 per cent; and China has the lowest rate of miscarriage, 23 per cent.
The mandatory "Health Protection Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a massive promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes worming twice a year as well as washing your hands with soap, brushing your teeth with fluoride every day.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of quickly removing germs has been improved by adding soap and detergents to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to disinfection and increase the resolution.
Water alone is insufficient for skin cleansing because fats and proteins, which are the components of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanliness, however, is with the help of proper flow of water.
In solid soap, due to reuse, bacteria may be present due to previous use.
A few researches that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid-polluted soaps say that it cannot be transferred because the bacteria go away with the foam itself.
The CDC still says that "liquid soap without hands control is a priority".
Antibacterial soaps have been greatly promoted in the health conscious public.
There is no evidence yet that the use of recommended pesticides creates antibiotic-resistant organic organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps have common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which are resistant to organic matter.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose antibiotic resistant, they won't be as effective as they've been said.
In addition to moisturizing substances and skin preservatives, more hygienic formulations may contain active benzoic acid as PH regulators (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), and skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts, etc.).
Hot water is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, to remove the natural oil, which absorbs the soil and bacteria, semi-heated, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water.
However, contrary to public belief, scientific studies say that semi-hot water is not effective for reducing germs by hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, hand-cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based hand-cleaning agents, disinfectants, or hand sanitizers) began gaining popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohols or ethanol that are mixed in a thickening agent, such as carbomer (multi-sacrificial compound of multi-acrylic acid) into a gel-shaped substance or in a moist substance such as glycerin, which is made into a liquid substance or for ease of use and to reduce the alcohol drying effect.
Adding oxide to dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with alcohol content of 60 to 95 percent are effective germs.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, varicella, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sanitizers containing 70% alcohol (reducing 3.5 logs, which is equivalent to 35 decibels) kill 99.97% of bacteria 30 seconds after use and 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for the norovirus or Norwalk, which is the most common cause of infectious disease of small intestine inflammation.
Brush the front and back of both hands and the middle and final parts of all fingers for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with sanitizer, especially when your hands are apparently contaminated.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and the ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizer can quickly dry out, unless creams and/or skin moisturizing items are added to the formula.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers that included creams, as compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents, reduces skin irritation and dryness.
In the case of various early illnesses or excessive sensitivity to alcohol or addictive substances to alcohol, there may be occasional allergy complaints.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, they tended to be less prone to inflammatory diseases.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents can't clean organic materials, they just clean them from germs.
That's why hand sanitizers are not more effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many germs, because germs live on hand.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizers are mostly dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically they have not been very effective.
In the recipes that have been used in recent days, unlike alcohol, overall antimicrobial function has been observed after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to the reaction in the skin, its efficiency has decreased.
In many low-income societies, people do not buy soap and instead use ash or clay.
Ashes and soil can be more effective than just water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is an antibacterial agent because it forms an alkaline solution after it is mixed with water.
WHO recommends ash or soil in the event of not being soapy.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the correct method of hand washing, in order to prevent the spread of the disease, consists of the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
A lot of water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not matter.
Rub hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle spaces of the fingers, and the bottom of the nail.
Soap removes germs quickly, and research has shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Wait for at least 20 seconds.
Mixing creates friction, which helps to remove germs quickly, and removes more germs by rubbing for a longer time.
Wash thoroughly with plenty of water.
Washing hands in the basin can get contaminated again.
Clean with a dry towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and damp hands can easily get contaminated again. Commonly leftovers include thumbs, wrists, spaces between the fingers and around the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-arid nails can be the site of polished germs.
Moisturizing lotions are usually recommended to protect the hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided, such as a hanging canister or lime-shaped vegetable with suitable holes, using ashes in developing countries from the inlet of water and/or if necessary.
The tippy-tap is a simple technique with a jaw hanging from a rope, and a lever moving from the feet that drips a little bit of water on a stick of hands and soap.
Efficient hand drying is part of the hand hygiene process, but it is debated as to what is the most effective way to dry in public hygiene rooms.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric drawers, which are often present in cleaners.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a research, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, the paper towel industry, which included paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet air dryers to offer hygiene grades.
After hand washing and hand drying with a hot air dryer, the bacterial rate on the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying from the jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in the rate of bacteria on the finger docks and 15% on the palms.
After hand washing and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers decreased by an average of 76 percent and on the palms of the hands by 77 percent.
The jet air dryer, which carries the air emission from the unit at the claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs from the hands and the unit, and can contaminate the other users of the cleaner and the cleaner environment at a distance of 2 meters.
Warm-air hand dryer can spread the germ to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study by TUV Product und Umwelt examined the different methods of hand drying.
The following changes have occurred in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different dryer manufacturers of hand dryers, and dryers have been compared to paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water, hand washing is an alternative.
Alcohol-based sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medically hand washing was made mandatory by Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis after discovering its effectiveness in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electrical appliances that provide the hospital staff with a feed-back so that they are reminded to wash their hands when they forget.
According to one study, their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically wash hands for at least 15 seconds, use soap and water or gel in a special amount to form foam and rub each part of the hand.
The fingers of the hands should be glued to each other.
If there is mail in the nails of the fingers, a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use the paper towel to close the water (and to open the back door if necessary).
This will not cause the hands to get contaminated again after applying to these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("irritants") and to prevent them from being transferred.
According to a report by the New England Journal of Medicine, the rate of hand washing is also unacceptably low in the medical environment, with a large number of doctors and nurses who routinely forget to wash their hands before patients touch them, thus becoming a means of transmitting germs.
According to a study, proper hand washing and other simple methods reduce the rate of urinary tract infections by up to 66%, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a paper showing the right way to wash your hands and shake hands in the health sector.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene by the agency can be viewed on their website for public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial appliances can test and verify hand hygiene, if such an action is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has outlined "five opportunities" for hand washing:
In the face of blood / body moisture
prior to the onset of the disease, and
After taking care of the patient, the additive chemical ("medicated or "antimicrobial" soap) in the soap gets the hand-washing agent.
There is a need for such a disinfection where the antibiotic resistant organisms are very high before or after surgery. For the operation to "crush" your hands, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching by hand, to wash with chlorhexidine or iodin, to clean with a brush, to clean with a brush, to clean with a brush, to wash your hands.
All the ornaments are removed.
In this process, the hands are washed from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6-2 minutes.
It is not necessary to take a long time (10 minutes).
When the water is poured on the middle of the arm, make sure that it does not go back to the hands.
When the hand washing is complete, the hands are dried with a germ-free cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after seeing the patient or to apply disinfectant to the hands.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has shown that the greatest benefits of hand hygiene came from the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased to 35%, there was little additional benefit.
In the context of the transfer of bacterial infectious disease in the diet, the use of plain soap showed three times more effect than the use of antibacterial soap. Alcohol-based solution and antibacterial soap compared to hand friction every 30 seconds.
However, H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores are more effective than alcohol-based soap and water to remove them by hand. If hand hygiene is improved in hygiene places, it will be necessary to train the staff for hand washing and hand washing.
Further research is needed to find out how these measures are more effective in different health settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be a means of achieving low cost, good health, and even good nutrition.
However, due to the lack of constant supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities at people's homes, schools and workplaces, it is a big challenge to adapt to the global handwashing habit of everyone.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa it is very rare to have a hand washing faucet near a private or public toilet, although there are many low-cost ways to make hand washing places.
However, the low hand washing rate may also be due to habit-forming rather than lack of soap and water.
Hand-washing with soap and soap can influence decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of hand-washing, and cause far-reaching changes in the behavior of the population.
Monitoring and testing are necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that working in a particular community in LMICs was more effective, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One way to advertise handwashing in schools is by taking "three-star approach" to other hygiene practices from UNICEF.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can reach the second and then the third star.
Creating hand-washing sites can be part of the promotional series of hand-washing, which aims to reduce illnesses and deaths in children.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a series of publicity warnings aimed at changing attitudes. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged handwashing emojis.
Some research has found that overall hand washing is less costly by ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, according to one review, promoting hand washing with soap is less costly than managing water and its drainage.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in unsafe conditions, such as mothers who have just given birth or hospitalized wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two first-hand hypnotists.
At that time, most people still believed that the cause of the infection was odor.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1980 promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of the infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 sparked awareness in many countries that soap-washing was essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung outside the public toilets, in the toilets of office buildings, and at the airport in Germany.
The phrase "Washing one's hands of" means that one should declare not to take responsibility for anything or to say anything.
The saying relates to the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to hang Jesus on the cross, but it later became an acronym in the English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to keep washing her hands in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, which reveals the cell of conscience for the crime of killing her husband.
It has also been shown that people wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or considering an immoral act, and handwashing is of great importance.
Furthermore, those who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to participate in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions also recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, i.e. the use of soapy water for hand washing, is characteristic of many religions: such as Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Judaism, Tula in Judaism, Natilat Yadhim, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vudu in Islam. Religions suggest hand washing in accordance with hygiene.
Washing hands after using toilets is a must in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Risks in the workplace for COVID-19.
Controlling the hazards in workplaces for COVID-19 means implementing occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of risks in workplaces depends on the nature of the workplace and the type of work, the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and in workers who may be unsafe for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers, suggesting basic measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, hygiene, and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing habits, and a clean environment.
The middle-disclosure risk is for people who are in contact with people who are not known to be infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transitions and international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, working environments in a densely populated population, and more number of retail spaces.
In addition to the basic safety measures to prevent infection for this node, high-performance air filters for air traffic control, scanning protection, and personal protective equipment are available if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers the appearance of health care and dead-house workers in front of a person with or suspected of COVID-19 to be an increased risk, a very high exposure risk if workers perform an air-sol-producing procedure or collect or handle samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
These workers will have to take appropriate measures to control the risk, such as air circulation, negative pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment that is in line with the nature of the job.
There are many possible effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
Workers may be absent due to the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
Trade procedures may vary, both in terms of demand for goods and in terms of acquisition of those goods (such as purchases at low altitudes, or delivery or drive-through facilities).
Finally, there may be geographically significant disruptions in the handling of goods from areas severely affected by COVID-19, and a plan to be prepared for and respond to infectious diseases may be used to guide protective actions.
Plans identify risk levels associated with various workplaces and job tasks, including sources of disclosure, risk factors arising from the home and community setting, and risk factors for individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the methods of containment and emergency plans for the situation arising out of the outbreak, which are necessary to deal with these threats.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or regional proposals.
Reducing the transfer between staff in response to an epidemic, protecting those who are at risk due to bad health complications, and minimizing adverse impacts in connection with business activities and supplies.
The community in which the business is located affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The risk management classification framework is very practical in occupational safety and health, so that the group risks are effectively controlled.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are controls, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately personal protective equipment.
The set-up is to isolate employees from work-related hazards, without relying on their behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution for the application.
Administrative control refers to a change in the policy and procedure of the work, which requires action from the worker or owner.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and management control, but can help prevent some appearance.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the hazards to workers, installed properly, if applicable (e.g., the salinity picking device), worn continuously and properly, maintained and replaced, whichever is needed, if properly removed, cleaned and stored, or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are in minimal professional contact with the public and other peers.
The main measures recommended for prevention of infection in all workplaces include frequent and thorough handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, ventilation and other hygiene practices, including coughing and sneezing, mouthwash and other hygiene procedures, providing tissues and litter, talking on the phone or in case of need.
Recognition and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a worrying step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay at home until the symptoms of fever, fever, or any other symptoms are gone at least 24 hours without the use of family medicines to reduce fever or other symptoms.
According to the OSHA, the middle-disclosure risk is jobs that require close or constant contact from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19 at a distance of six feet (1.8 meters), but may be caused by community transmission around the business or by transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on a large scale, or because the individual has a recent international travel.
These include those who are in touch with the public, such as in schools, the working environment in the metropolitan area and in large numbers of retail outlets, COVID-19 trainings, COVID-19 trainings, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person, in-person and face-to-face meetings, in-person or face-to-person meetings.
The use of the respirator in this group of workers at risk is rare.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, it means proper control to protect workers and other passengers, to keep the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, to allocate one member of the staff to the patient, and to offer a face mask to the sick person, or to tell the patient to cover his mouth and hand with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching body moisture or potentially contaminated surfaces, the ship's crew should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in bags made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the risk of exposure to the disease includes postponement of medical travel in case of emergencies, and if the ship is isolated and has fever or any symptoms.
For schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends short-term closures if an infected person has entered a school building, even if they have not spread the virus, to be cleaned or disinfected.
When there is a small to medium-sized transmission of the virus, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or cancelling meals in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the desks, hygiene and avoiding unnecessary visits, and limiting the time of arrival and departure of children.
When there is a substantial amount of migration to the local community, the long-term closure of schools, in addition to social distancing strategies, is considered less of an immediate health risk for law enforcement staff who are performing their daily activities, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers, who have to contact people with COVID-19 for certain or suspected reasons, are recommended to follow the same guidelines for emergency technics, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during panic, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning sprays or wipes before re-use, and follow the standard implementation procedures for the use and disposal of used PPE and containment and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, some health centers and dead-end workers are at risk of being exposed to more or too much exposure.
High-risk jobs include health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk when workers take aerosol-producing action, or collect or manage samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the process of making aerosols, insertion of ducts, cough-related procedures, examination of ducts of the throat, certain dental procedures and examinations, or collection of unpleasant specimens.
High-risk job openings in the morgue include workers who produce dead bodies of people who were known or suspected to have died of COVID-19; these risk groups include additional set-up controls, including separate rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when the procedure for making aerosols is followed.
Special negative-pressure air circulation devices may be appropriate in some health centers and dead cells.
The samples should be touched under the safety measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in specific waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, the OSHA recommends respiratory devices for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from a known patient or a suspected SARS-CoV-2 person, and those who perform paid aerosol procedures.
In light of a comprehensive and written safety respiratory program in the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering device should be used for respiratory or better, including appropriate testing, training and medical testing.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve worker's comfort.The WHO does not recommend full coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not a disease transmitted from the body's moisture.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks in place of the entry screen for staff.
People who are collecting respiratory samples, taking care of or transferring COVID-19 patients without an aerosol maker procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or shields, cows, and gloves for the face.
If the aerosol maker procedure is performed, replace the surgical mask with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, allowing only those who are directly caring for COVID-19 patients to enter the room, the use of PPE is essential for specific tasks, the use of PPE without the supervision of the patient and the monitoring of many patients with the same disease, the use of the same respirator, the use of PPE without the discharge of the patient.

<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> [COVID-19]: Preparing for the future.
Post date/time: March 14, 2020, 00:24UTC
L.A.C.C.: There are no rules
We are facing a lot of difficulties this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that humans are interconnected and we are responsible for each other.
We don't have a precedent for this kind of challenge, but we know very well that our best response is to build a global cohesion, co-operation, and community that runs in the spirit of the institution.
The feelings of friendship and attention we've seen in all of our peers email, phone calls, and chats are all a testament to how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud that you're all my car.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to get back to Wikipedia, and how strong it is for this critical resource to be available online.
Your work has made it possible, whether you're with the Sites or our peers who pay or our community stays safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
It is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from next week on how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn first expressed, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered what would be the most appropriate response to what we are facing, and how to keep the organization on its feet at the moment.
We wanted to end the stress for a long time and promote our mission.
If you want to dial.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily working hours will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until the order is renewed.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work as usual, the mission can put you to use.
However, nothing can be said about the world at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a bargain selfie, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't track your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
There is no need to say that, but we are saying it.
There is no need for a sick day or PTO - just tell your manager and help recreate your team's calendar and schedule, ensuring that all aspects of the work are complete.
(If you get a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, notify Bryan within T&C Ops, can help with T&C support, and make sure the administration pays appropriate attention to your situation.)
Full payment will be made to those who work for hours.
We have said this before, and we are repeating our responsibilities to our contractors and hourly staff.
Each person will be paid according to the hours they meet during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people work in the world around them to make a change in their mental state.
What we can do is incredibly profitable, especially in times like these.
This is all for your personal safety.
All we have to do is talk to your manager, it will give us an idea of what to expect from you and then fix things accordingly.
Any work is considered necessary.
There are some things we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (other than others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We examine recent goals with all sectors and change our focus to support what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will only focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down at this time will not hurt us later.
We don't plan to "complete it" once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines, which is currently unrealistic.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and where appropriate we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
In order to adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to set up our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to expand our 2019-2020 plan, which takes a lot of time to create a budget where workers are allowed to change their work preferences, and see their loved ones in a situation where they can accommodate those in need who want to work for less time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the ongoing planning work and pressure in the entire organization.
We will introduce our plan to the board next week and get confirmation as soon as the delegation and teams are notified of the next step.
Thank you for leading the team.
Office Status, Appearance and Cleaning
Last week, we heard that one of our SF-based friends may be affected by COVID-19.
However, despite extreme caution, we have staffed the San Francisco office for an anti-virus operation to clean up all surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant solution to clean the arms of each level of the bromide and the staircase through which we have access.
The building is using the products of its own Discovery Channel that take care of the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be completely ready as soon as we decide to return.
Our DC Office is located in Vwork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with all DC Office staff members and with us.
By now last week, our DC office went to a remote location in accordance with the San Francisco-based Joint Directive.
As many of us know, we live in the UK, and we also live in the UK.
These discussions are ongoing and may be delayed.
This is my first time working remotely.
We know that this can be a bit of an adjustment and we want to give you some advice.
The duration of the meetings can be extended for more than one or two hours.
If long seats are required, consider how to divide them on different days.
Make the meeting clear as to each agenda, and send the relevant content first.
Make the video the default, using facilities such as Google Docs and Zoom for direct collaboration and communication.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, one should monitor the discussion for questions and follow the list of speakers, and one should help take a note (or make a note with mutual assistance).
If you need a relaxing ten-headset, send an email to technical support.
Use your money to pay for Snakes.
Join the <0x23>RemoteChannel in Slack to talk about the shared work with colleagues:
The HR Operations team is considering webinar-based aerodynamics guidance to help the distributed workforce across the entire foundation.
Last week, we asked all social recipients to cancel Wikimedia's privileged public celebrations, such as AIDS, until the World Health Organization announced the end of the pandemic.
They should be aware that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions may make it possible to complete their accepted cooperation activities and that there will be no additional penalties for modifications or delays in these objectives.
Next week we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and topical social conferences.
The general feeling of the entire global community is sad about the disruption, but they are satisfied with their own communities, wikimedia, etc., with their own clear ability to focus.
Growing up, CRT is working on creating a web page on Meta Wiki to give the community the opportunity to track and monitor their interactions with them.
Stay in touch with COVID-19-related matters.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the latest information, answer your questions and spend some time communicating with each other.
We are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email and other essential information about COVID-19 on the Office wiki.
CRT This page will stop all updates and other information in one place.
We are working to establish regular contacts with members of staff who are currently living in countries that are heavily affected.
If you have a trip, a celebration, an important workout, a coverage challenge, or anything else that you need help with, don't hesitate to work with the CRT and get notifications.
We are here to provide you with the support and support you need.
If you have a secret or sensitive matter, please email Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as discarding our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition at this point that our work and responsibilities will need to be delayed in a way that we have never seen before.
These are the steps that we understand it is important to help each other so that we can continue to work, to support our movement that it needs, and to serve the world on which it relies.
When the time comes, our work will be there waiting for us.
From now on, it is time to help each other and take the opportunity to do important work that will come in a few weeks, but possibly in a few months.
We all need you to do this, and that's why you all need to take care of yourself and your family so that you are ready for the best when the need arises.
Now, please, don't shake your hands and don't shave your face!

B angiotensin - enzyme 2 convertible (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to the level of angiotensin II and makes it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease by increasing the number of igs (1-7).
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of enzyme that contains methylene, which is found on endothelial levels and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the enterminal peptides m2 domain and a cterminal collagen renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I olfactory protein, with its enzyme active domain emitting on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The domain outside the ACE2 cells is chloridized from the transmembrane domain by a second enzyme called scheduling, and as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream that eventually exits through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organelles: ACE2 is primarily linked to lung type II fatty cells, small intestinal insufficiencies, arterial and uterine indoctyl cells, and arthritic smooth muscle cells.
The effect of ACE2 RNA is also found in the brain's outer lining, body contour, lower extremity from the little finger, in the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as the opposite balance of ACE.
ACE inhibits angiotensin I hormone in the blood vessels of angiotensin II.
In return, the ACE2 carboxyl terminal amino acid separates the phenylalanine from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysates the vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Tyr-Vyr-H-I-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-P-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-
ACE2 can also separate a number of other peptides, including [des-arginine 9] -bridekine, acetone, neurotinine, dinorphine A, and homeopathy.
ACE2 also controls the transport of natural amino acids to the membranes of SLC6A19 and is involved in brain disorders.
As a protein transistor, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the removal of zoonosis restriction on the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2's spike S1 protein cells leads to the ingestion of cellular neural material and the transfer of both viruses and enzymes into cells.
This process of intervention also requires the oleate of Sprotein by the representative serene proteins TMPRSS2, which is being denied as a potential treatment under current investigation. This has led some people to conclude that a lack of ACE2 levels in the cells may make it easier to combat the disease.
However, a number of professional societies and organizations have advised not to continue with the general ACEA inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia B in patients treated with ACE inhibition, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, has also decreased.
ACE inhibitors are also linked to a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less powerful than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human implantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a modern treatment for severe lung injury, and it appeared that it would improve hemodynamics and oxygen supply with a lipopolysaccharide mildew severe respiratory distress symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the action begins in 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour effect.
A number of results suggest that rhACE2 may be an improved drug for people with intolerance to the classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases where the circulation of angiotensin II is increased - a higher level of rhACE2 imaging has been diagnosed during clinical trials to treat acute respiratory distress.
The B'COVID-19 app is a mobile application that helps communicate during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying people ("relations") who have been in contact with an infected person.
A number of such applications have been made or proposed in several areas and jurisdictions in collaboration with the government.
A number of application frameworks have been developed to find the connection.
Privacy concerns were raised, especially about the system that allows the app's users to locate the location.
The low-interference alternative involves the use of Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to another mobile phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will collaborate to integrate these types of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to find out if they were in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. The app called TraceTogether is being used in Singapore.
The app was developed by a local IT community, released as an independent source and will be referred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" which can detect the proximity of potential victims and provide immediate response to health check-ups.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-finding app is in the next phase of development and will be available for release within a week - with plans to launch the same type of application ("Stop Covid") in Ireland and France as well.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering the development of applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol - Russia intends to introduce the Geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, to ensure that people do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has put a number of potential practical difficulties in the app-based systems, including false positive results and the possibility of low effectiveness, in the event that the application is limited to a small segment of the population.
Removing concerns about the spread of the false or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to their App Store, limiting them to only "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also made similar moves.
Privacy experts have expressed their concerns about the innumerable restrictions on surveillance on the coronavirus app, especially on whether surveillance arrangements set up to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be revoked after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance arrangements.
These institutions have announced eight conditions on government schemes:
The monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and monitoring should be extended for a specific period of time:
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
The protection of data and anonymity shall be protected and shall be disclosed on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance must be avoided by making excessive discrimination and non-critical;
The data must be disclosed to a third party under the Data Sharing Act;
Protective measures must be taken against abuses and citizens have the right to respond to abuses;
All "relevant partners" will require a purposeful participation, including public health experts and non-profit groups; the German Kiosk Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporter without Borders (RSF) also released monitoring lists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to solve the problem of constant monitoring by eliminating the monitoring method, from its operating system device, when it is not needed.
Some countries used a network-based location monitoring system instead of the app, eliminating both the need to download the application and the ability to avoid monitoring.
A network-based monitoring system was adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, including access to the gross data of the Opportunity Palace, are likely to have major privacy issues.
However, not all connected systems with central servers require access to personal opportunity palace data; a number of privacy protection systems have been developed that only use central servers for reporting to each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using an excellent application, the system collects monitoring information from a variety of sources, including monitoring data and card-to-card exchanges in a mobile device, and collects all of them and generates notices via text messages to potentially affected people.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the information of the Opportunity Palace publicly available to inform potential contacts, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws when the MERS epidemic broke out in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries such as Germany have also considered both central and privacy protection systems.
Details were not released until April 6, 2020.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth's weakened energy (BLE) that allow the user to access the palace from other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an integrated effort consisting of both central and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. In decentralized protocols: Decentralized Privacy Protection Location Monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FCT) and Other Event Contact Numbers, CEN, Mobile Privacy Protocol.
These protocols do not go through any identifiable personal data device and are compatible with all devices.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab is developing a secure pathway, a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The letter is based on research conducted by "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in a Pandemic" released in March 2020. A second attempt by Engma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, was originally set up in MIT Media Lab itself.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the foundations of the Global TCN Alliance were laid down by groups that had the same vision for the purpose and who had the same broadly invasive protocols to reduce the spread of Shiraz so that surveillance and alerting apps could be enabled globally as a mutually beneficial step towards mass adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had freed the BlueTrace application, which was used by its government.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform-controlled companies, Google and Apple, announced a move to track contacts that, according to their claim, would protect privacy, based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and security privacy encryption.
He also published the specifications of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three phases:
The implementation of these protocols will enable the governments to issue official privacy protection applications for the detection of coronavirus.
Google and Apple intend to solve this persistent monitoring problem through direct integration with iOS and Android, first by distributing the system through operating system updates, and later by removing it in the same way when the threat is eliminated.
B's change of medication (also known as change of medication, re-profile, work, or treatment) is the change or use of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease, rather than the medical condition of another disease for which it was originally developed.
It is an online scientific research that is currently underway to investigate effective and safe treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of healthy plasma, with SARS-CoV-2 containing about 66 viable drug proteins, each of which has multiple sites of synthesis.
The analysis of these synthesis sites provides an appropriate plan for developing effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
SARS-CoV-2's most aggressive target proteins are papyrus-like, as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helix, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate, proteins.
Hussein A.

On April 2, Germany announced it would purchase the drug from Japan for its reserves, and use it through the military in university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has overtaken the Trump administration over the purchase of the drug - which may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already matured.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/retinavir (cliente), which is a mixture of antiviral lopinavir and retinavir, has concluded that it "has not seen any benefit".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from being replicated by binding to proteins.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to switch medicines to find a compound that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which are being criticized in the scientific community for turning resources into regenerative medicines, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lupinavir/Retnavir in the international coordination test.
Remdesivir was developed by Glade Science for the prevention of Ebola virus disease and for the treatment of Marburg virus diseases, and its subsequent Glade Science immediately discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity against a number of foeo, femo, paramixo and corona-viruses in vitro.
An issue with antiviral treatment is the proliferation of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. A number of such clinical trials, including those administered by two Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with low-grade and another for people with serious illness, are included.
For serious COVID-19 patients hospitalized, there are three clinical trials involving vitamin C in the vein; two relievers controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italian).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, a number of efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, which would make the vaccine available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five candidates for the vaccine are in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was reported in December 2019.
In 2020, there was a major outbreak outside the world, leading to considerable investment and research activities in the development of a vaccine.
Many companies are using advertised loonies to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEP's imperative steps to develop the vaccine are rapid, providing the capacity, deployment, and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include a number of major platform targets:
Nucleic Acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Manufacturers and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: ear sinus biology, adenovirus type 5 vectors)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (according to the Melken Institute), and 37 others announced but little public information is available about them (assuming they are in the planning phase or are now in the design phase).
Phase I-II tests are preliminary safety and immunization tests, usually uncomplicated, controlled by the harmless substance of the drug, and occur on multiple sites, while determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring the side effects on most doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active preparation (certified as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet detectable in humans (still in "pre-medical" research).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that could boost an immune response by genetically altering viral proteins.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, which will be assembled with Hilot Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits in addition to the disease that they want to avoid.
In Australia, 4,170 medical check-ups are underway for another randomized trial.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or effective in the preparation phase.
Preliminary research to test the efficacy of vaccines using specific animal samples for COVID-19, such as ACE2-donkey mice, other laboratory animals and non-human high-grade creatures, identify the need for bioprotection level 3 measures to deal with the virus directly, and international coordination to ensure quality protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS has been found to be safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and production of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When the MERS was discovered, it was thought that existing SARS research would be a useful model in the treatment of the MERS-CoV disease and the preparation of vaccines.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed Phase I clinical trials on humans and the other three had been released, all of which were vectorized viral vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS-MMERS-GAMVac), and one
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and its vaccines are already available.
Various posts on social media showed patents pointing to the existing patents of genetic sequences and vaccines and another tree of coronaviruses such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include swelling, pain in the thighs, diarrhea, inflammation in the throat, loss of sensation of snoring, and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days from the appearance to the onset of symptoms, but can last from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are of a minor nature, minor viral pneumonia and organ failure go on.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 Mumak and areas, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered - mainly from close contact with people, often in the form of mouth-to-mouth drops when talking, coughing or sneezing.
Although similar droplets come out when exhaling, they often fall on the ground or on the floor, instead, they can spread disease over a long distance.
After chewing the affected surface, people can also get the disease by chewing their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
The virus can survive up to 72 hours on surfaces.
It is the most contagious disease within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it can also be spread before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the periodic reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and who are in good health.
There is a disagreement with the proposal to wear a mask for the general public, some officials are against its use, some advise its use, and some say it is necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the World Health Organization (WHO).
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or have symptoms such as colds, fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, frequent chest pain or pressure, mental illness, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention.
Symptoms of the disease can also be seen in the upper part of the respiratory tract, such as a sore throat, nose swelling or sore throat.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
At first, there were only a few cases of chest pain and stiffness in China.
In rare cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, excessive organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days, but may be two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will do so within 11.5 days of being infected.
The extent of these symptoms is not fully known, but early evidence suggests that they may be contagious.
The proportion of people infected with the disease is currently unknown and is being studied, where the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stays are without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission began counting cases without symptoms in its daily cases from April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infected patients were given no information at the time of the test on that day.
The viral load can be high in both the touque and the bulge.
Speaking out loud brings out more drops than normal conversation.
A study in Singapore found that unwanted dandruff can go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) in droplets.
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioresol transmission may be possible and that viral RNA samples have been positive in those who collect air in the halls outside of people's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can Aerosolize the respiratory tract and, as a result, spread in the air.
Now that the risk is considered low, the virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in people; and if it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear, the risk is reduced.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it's not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be viable for up to four hours a day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and 99% on copper.
However, it varies in terms of humidity and temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products inactivate the virus's greasy protective layer, as well as cleansing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
The second solution, Hiace benzconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, wholesale samples were taken within an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, and the sixth patient had the highest viral load in the second day's test.
The appearance of symptoms of severe respiratory distress is coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) acute nodule respiratory disease, first detected in three people in Wuhan with pneumonia with severe respiratory illnesses.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the respective coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which teares its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
They are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because viruses access these host cells through the enzyme-altering enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most commonly found in type II diaphragm cells.
The virus uses a certain level of sugar to bind to ACE2, called a "cell" (pipolymer), and enters the host cell.
12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, have had severe heart injuries and are frequently diagnosed with severe disease.
Symptoms of heart disease are higher due to inflammation and diseases that occur throughout the body, but severe heart attack can also be linked to ACE2 connectors.
2ACEs are more visible in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Patients in the intensive care unit affected by COVID-19 saw higher incidence of arterial blood clotting (31%) and thyrombobolism (25%) and may be associated with a poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a reversal for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract cervical cells, severe patients with COVID-19 have more inflammation symptoms than usual that affect the body.
In particular, sickening SM-CSF-secreting T-cells were found to be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6 cells in patients with COVID-19 and associated with severe lung diseases.
Interference of lymphatic cells was also reported at the time of the post-mortem.
The WHO has published several methods of testing the disease.
The standard method of experiments is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in time.
Tests are usually done on samples of breath moisture obtained from the created infi-root; however, samples of nose-root or spleen can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and results are of immediate importance.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate a variant of the coronavirus and published a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infectious diseases caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (which indicate active infectious disease and whether or not someone has been infected in the past) were in the preparation stages, but are not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment of the test showed accuracy of only 60% to 70%.
The FDA approved the first test center for use at the end of the month in the United States on March 21, 2020; the Zongan Hospital at Wuhan University issued diagnostic guidelines keeping in view the medical characteristics and pandemic risk to detect the epidemic.
In early infectious disease, double-sided multi-house, ground-glass opacities are common, inappropriate and later fragmented blurring.
As the disease worsens, complete dominance, creasing (the thickness of the earbuds is variable, such as a sprained ankle) and stability can appear.
Some statistics on the microbial glands and pathophysiology of COVID-19 are available.
The main results on the post-mortem are:
Microscopic: inflammation of the lung membrane, inflammation of the scalp heart, stabilization of the lungs and inflammation of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Lightened pneumonia: a lung swelling, excessive formation of pneumocytes, large abnormal pneumocytes, with the formation of cavity swelling and multi-alkaline giant sized cells.
Severe pneumonia: Decreased lung loss (DAD) with low lung sweating.
D.A. fear is caused by the appearance of symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARDS) and a severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Pneumonia: The organization of the ejection in the Olivoler cavities and pulmonary insufficiency
Blood: blood clotting spread in the veins (DIC); white and red blood reaction.
Precautions to reduce the chances of disease include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water, washing hands for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good hygiene of the respiratory system, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and if the tissue is not available, the use of the inside of the cranium.
Proper hygiene use is encouraged for the hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth to cover the face in the crowd to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms, with social distancing strategies aimed at closing schools and offices, lifting travel restrictions and cancelling large public gatherings to reduce contact with a large group of affected people.
The distance guide also includes people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
Since the vaccine is not expected until 2021, an important point in tackling COVID-19 is to reduce the highest level of the epidemic, called "floating."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dirty, before eating and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but only when soap and water are not readily available. in areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO formulates two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity is produced from ethanol and isopropanol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial varicose veins; it is "not an active substance for bacterial varicose veins."
Glycerol is poured as a paste.
People are organized with supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, and support for other important affected organs.
The CDC has recommended that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracurricular membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems, but its benefits are still under consideration.
It has been suggested to improve personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and better dietary immunity.
Supportive treatment can be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the epidemic, with WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., physicians and psychiatrists have compiled a free resource, the IBCC, to seek treatment suggestions from various agencies.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical practitioners suggested paracetamol (mistayaminophen) as an important drug in place of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of spreading the virus, especially in a medical environment where medical procedures such as forklifts or hand ventilation are performed.
For medical staff caring for people affected by COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in the Airborne Infection Room (AIIR) in addition to general precautions, contact precautions and precautions for airborne germs.
The recommended equipment is: PPE goons, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves.
The N95 respirator has been approved for industrial environment, but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used only under emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but they do not guarantee the effect of use against any particular unauthorized biological agent.
When the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield or a home-made mask, as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 often don't get so bad that they need mechanical infusions or replacements, but some percentage of patients need them.
Active study is being conducted on the type of respiratory support in hospitalized people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19, with some evidence that high-flow nasal cannula or inhalation cannula can be avoided with the pressure of bilateral positive ventilation.
It is not known which of the two will benefit the same severely ill people.
Some doctors prefer unpleasant mechanical rinsing when available because this method limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe illness is more common in older adults (especially those who are over 60 years old and those who are over 80 years old).
There is no per-bed surplus in developed countries, which limits the ability to handle an increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in the health system who need to be hospitalized.
According to one study, 5% in China were admitted to intensive care unit, 2.3% needed mechanized ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people infected with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care units.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as COVID-19 increases severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-control mode and high PEEP ventilators capable of delivering more oxygen and ventilators need to minimize the risk of damage to the lungs and air in the chest.
There will be no more PPE available on older ventilators.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical experimental stage.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it may take some time until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
The FDA has allowed artificially cured individuals' plasma to be used experimentally when a person's life is at serious or immediate risk.
It did not go through medical studies showing itself to be safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to stop the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app can detect "close contact" using monitoring numbers and therefore tell the potential risk of infection.
Each user can view the status of three other users as well.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local medical officials, including mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, tracking mobile phones, and use of big data on artificial intelligence to locate victims and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who should have the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to quarantine and protect those who are in contact with the affected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom compiled data from mobile phone space with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect the quarantine breakers.
The Italian Regional Health Administration said it had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people were walking around."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon with 42,000 candidates over the weekend.
Estonia's President Christy Cajulaid also voiced international support for a creative solution to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, the side effects of treatment, or the fear of the pandemic itself.
"Excessive social distancing, isolation, health anxiety, stress and economic distress are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being," the BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying.
The disease can take a milder turn with or without any symptoms, which is similar to other common respiratory diseases such as fever.
Normally, patients recover in two weeks, while patients with severe or serious illness recover in three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may also be at greater risk from COVID-19 based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data from COVID-19 is not available.
In people who are severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly turn into severe respiratory disease (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, body mold, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, especially in 6% of COVID-19 patients, was found to increase the duration of blood clotting, while normal non-functioning kidneys were found in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people affected by COVID-19 showed an increase in the amount of liver enzymes (tranaminosis).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in the hospital.
However, the time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the average duration from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full range was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8% in men, while the mortality rate was 1.7% in women.
Post-mortem medical examination of the lungs to the presence of air in the lungs was found to cause damage to the small tissues with the presence of fibromyalgia.
Changes related to the disease of living virus cells have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs is similar to the respiratory distress symptoms (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8 percent of deaths were observed due to troponin or movement of the heart.
According to the U.S. March figures, 89 percent of hospitalized patients already had mild illnesses, and the availability of medical resources and the region's socioeconomics could also have an impact on mortality rates.
Rates of mortality vary due to regional variations, but this can also be due to difficulties in the procedure.
The low mortality rate of common patients can lead to an overdose.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of pre-existing diseases means that the current mortality rate is low.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and the need for intensive care or mortality rate was 2.4 times higher than non-smokers.
The administration of the Hong Kong Hospital observed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung tests identified organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of severe care symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known if it had long-term immunity in people recovering from past pandemics.
Immunity is likely to be seen based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have also been cases in which positive outcomes of the coronavirus have re-appeared after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worsening due to prolonged contagious disease rather than re-contagious disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an infectious disease from animals.
Its origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first case of symptoms appeared on December 1, 2019.
The WHO's official publication reported on December 8, 2019, as the first date for the onset of the disease.
A number of steps are usually taken to determine the cause of death.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the onset of the epidemic, and the demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and assigned U07.2 to laboratory-confirmed medical or epidemiological deaths from COVID-19.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global mortality and incidence ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the Mortality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths in confirmed cases, and the Pandemic Mortality Rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of deaths in infected people (confirmed and unconfirmed).
These figures do not cover a particular time period and cover a specific population from disease to case resolution.
Although not all infected people exhibit antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
A small village with a population of 4,600 in the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, the Castegliani di Ada, with 80 (1.7%) people already dead.
In Gangglat, the disease spread due to festivals of Catholic Christians, and spread to younger people, causing the mortality rate to be relatively low, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been categorized in this way.
Moreover, Germany's health system has not been defeated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured by blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed as COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of the pandemic are different in men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk among men is after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this sexual difference is not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological variations, lower consumption of tobacco in women and men, and the incidence of other diseases compared to women in men, such as high blood pressure at an early age, can lead to an increase in mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 percent of the infected were men, and 72 percent of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not been able to locate gender-related statistics for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in a variety of ways.
Most of the medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at higher risk of being infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO President Tetdros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained CO from Corona, VI from the virus, D from the disease, and 19 from the day the first event appeared: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal type, or group of people, keeping in mind international recommendations to prevent stigma The virus that causes COVID-19 is the manifestation of symptoms of severe respiratory disease called coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and varicose veins are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
During the initial outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as the transitory names of the virus and the virus, according to a 2015 directive against using a place name in the name of disease and virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are testing medical equipment such as nozzle inserts and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the seller was not delivered at the required time, a local craftsman produced a copy of it and made the required 100 valve overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misconceptions about the onset of disease, duration, prevention, treatment and other initiatives emerged and quickly spread over the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral development in pigs, butterflies and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved for the treatment of the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry examiners.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "synthetic experiments" to assess the effects of treatment from four of the most effective existing antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same means to enter ACE2 human cells.
Three new vaccines are being developed.
The aim of the research is to develop a vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, can create immediate immunity in the human body against the new disease of COVID-19.
Another strategy, the sub-injection vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that sensitizes some of the sub-components of the virus in the immune system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research center is the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nuclear-acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccines, the novel way of developing vaccines).
The experimental vaccine developed from these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was conducted on four volunteers in Seattle on March 16, 2020.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code that was copied from the virus that spreads the disease, suggesting that the antibody-dependent enhancer is a potential challenge in the preparation of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active medical experiments are underway.
Seven trials are testing a drug that is already approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research consists of re-recommended antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir reported in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, there has been a dynamic review process for candidates for the development and use of COVID-19 vaccines. A number of existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are under investigation, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, along with lopinavir/rotonevir and lopinavir.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence of efficacy from remdesivir.
Medical improvements were observed in patients treated with lesser use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy, and chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are still waiting for the results of the survey.
The medical administrations of Korea and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, even though the Wuhan Institute for Virology recommends one gram of daily dose, there are reminders that double doses of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for doctors who are engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 patients to use chloroquine and hydrochloroquine at their discretion.
Preliminary data suggest that higher amounts of robo-viruses are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitaxaxand has been suggested for further veto studies after showing low concentrations in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the transmembrane proteins necessary for entry into SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have major inhibitions in studies with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical class from accepting this treatment without further study.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence to suggest that hydroxychloroquine is a characteristic of the anti-cytokine stream. After completing a brief study, Tocilizumab was added to the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China.
Italy is undergoing phase 2 randomized testing at the national level after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
The combined serum ferritin blood test, which identifies the cystokine stream, aims to counteract such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, for the treatment of steroid refractive cytokine release disease, a different cause - CART cell therapy - the FDA approved the antiretroviral receptor receptor 6 competitor based on past-type studies.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment against CRS.
Clean and concentrated antibodies developed by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 are being researched as a passive vaccine against transmission to those who need it.
This strategy was tested with unconfirmed results for SARS.
Viral neutralization is a predictive mechanism that can lead to inactive antibody treatments defending against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible depending on the antibody.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of assisted monoclonal antibody, are being worked on.
The production of phytoestrogens, which are a liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contain specific antibodies to the virus, can be prepared for early use.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenling, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, was infected after raising awareness about the spread of the virus and died of COVID-19.
