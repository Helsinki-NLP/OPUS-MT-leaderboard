It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is derived from the image sensor format of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually, to some degree, confusingly, 36mm by 24mm in height.
The desired ratio of this form (divided by the bar to get the lowest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS national format) are the same or almost the same as this aspect ratio.

"Science has now indicated that this huge carbon economy is changing the status quo of our planet, which has been supporting human civilization for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in the society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In the United States, there is some kind of objection to the quality of the water that is being objected to by the parties.
Why do transport systems produce such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just disabled? Or is there a more urgent process?
The study of the movement of separate drivers and the movement of vehicles between two points and one of them interacting with the other is called the movement of vehicles.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study the right side of the vehicle because the behavior of the driver cannot be estimated to be 100% accurate.
Fortunately, the use of drivers was fairly good; therefore, the volume of the vehicle was reasonably stable and numerically calculated at the fingertips.
In order to accurately represent traffic, there are three main characteristics: (1) straightness, (2) density, and (3) acceleration.

Members of the working group sometimes work to protect the relationship for their frail physical group.
They are sometimes more independent than regular members of the group because their groups are logged separately from time to time, which is not understood by their local management.
The original "Invisible Team" (Larsen & LaFast, 1989, p109) is a unique element of the virtual team.
"The ""Invisible Team"" is the management team in which all members submit their reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."""
Why would an organization want to solve a time-consuming process when setting up a training organization? One of the objectives of practicing organizational knowledge concepts is innovation.
