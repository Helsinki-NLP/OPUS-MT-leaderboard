A black box in your car.
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the degraded highway system, many people are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits cleanly on your car’s dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and transmits that information to the authorities, has become a controversial attempt by Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the outdated system to finance major U.S. roads.
In general, boring work such as highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and lively alliances.
Having a description of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive - and then using this information to prepare a tax bill - have joined Libertarian environmental groups to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party is amazing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned with raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move into a system in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road in the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is really a must-have for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not we choose to say it," says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, who plans to begin tracking every mile that motorists in California decide by the year 2025.
We are going to change the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund is almost bankrupt, which is financed by paying taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
The car now runs more miles than ever in a gallon of gas.
Federal taxes have not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians refrain from increasing even a penny in taxes.
"Gas tax is absolutely not sustainable," says Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
“In the long run it will serve as the most rational option,” he says.
Wanx calls it mileage-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, as it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars drive, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A.P.A.) also considers the black box the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers at the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"It's not just doing what's going into a blind well," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been backed by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in their 2011 report, graced the Congress with a move towards per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, representing individuals who have to walk too many miles to go to work or to the city every day, the House's leadership put an end to that proposal.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most enthusiastic Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor each of their steps.
"Anxiety about the Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem,"" says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation."
It’s not what people wanted.
As the trial proceeded, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device.”
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which must be disseminated in order to keep a record of every person’s daily arrivals.
Nevada is one of the many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is running every day, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The discovery of this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device that it is testing was good for highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a certain time interval.
“If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they’ll be more willing to adopt this method,” said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some major errors in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also less expensive and less interventional ways to do so.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without a GPS.
Or again any device can choose not to take, but rather choose to pay the fee determined by the average miles to be determined by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meters fees, provide "pay as per your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
“Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it due to the benefits it receives,” the city planning document mentions.
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all of the discussion on payments per mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of insolvent highway trust funds by increasing gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual fee may be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work," said the Commission's legislative and public affairs director, Randy Rentsheller.
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
According to the police, he died of drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of concealing the deceased's belongings.
The police have submitted the final report of the death to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Darya.
His family members had accused him of murdering his friends as his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that her phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman said that the phone was given to her by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also resides in Padashahi Garden and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail went to Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid took off his clothes and put everything on the edge, while Ruhail went on the other side to smoke a cigarette.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he only had his clothes on.
Ruhail searched for Zahid, but he could not be found.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and kept them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that he was drowning.
The police told the court that Zahid died of drowning and the post-mortem has also been confirmed.
The accused has been taken into custody under Section 404 of the IPC for concealing the facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly intelligent way.
This was revealed by his family friend Martel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
It is here that Francesca, whose relationship was being told about her relationship with Balrusconi, appears to be purely a relationship.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-bunga girl Marthele Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
When Polanco was asked about what would happen if the two got married on Italian Radio 2, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place at the private chapel in the former prime minister's house.
No one else can say anything.
However, she did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
The couple got married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, she was engaged to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman who was 50 years younger than her.
Berlusconi's loneliness was the basis behind his decision to avoid the kirkari.
In the low-lying areas, rain continued incessantly between the sun's eye and Michauli.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire plaint.
The minimum temperature in Srinagar was 4.8 degrees Celsius, minus -0.2 degrees Celsius in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
Meanwhile, the strategically important Srinagar-Leh national highway has been closed for traffic due to rains and snowfall.
There was heavy snowfall on the Jodhpur road.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the western disturbance, the snowfall started in the highlands and lowlands of the plaintiffs early in the morning and continued till late in the evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People were forced to stay at home to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was disrupted in many areas.
The maximum temperature in Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
Meanwhile, the night temperature in Jammu has increased due to heavy rains.
Jammu recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the western disturbance has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lott, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather is likely to remain dry in the plaint from November 1 to November 1.
Asaram, who is lodged in jail on charges of sexual harassment, was again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In his media coverage, Asaram is being portrayed as a children's blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop reporting on Asaram, saying it had seen every word reported in the media and did not see any reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed the case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying that they had more options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram's demand to ban media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group operator of the mall deducted the TDS and paid to the concerned financial institutions but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, the TDS kept depositing the rupee with it.
The team, which arrived from Mumbai on October 17, had taken action in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
The investigation revealed that the trader had deducted the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the team of TDS had launched an income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, raids and surveys were carried out on the group of the mall operator.
Aggrieved by the action, the businessman has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that he is not ready to pay TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them.
The officials investigating the matter have made it clear that in case of non-payment, the recovery will be done by sealing the account.
With Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
As a result, the sales of fake and low-end products are on the rise.
Chemicals are used to make sweets brighter, colorful and sweeter, which is dangerous for health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake cannabis and chemical sweets.
The department seized Rs 70,000 from Mawa and Rs 5,000 from Quetta Colony in Madhya Pradesh.
With the demand for sweets in the market, there has been an increase in demand for low-fat maize from Madhya Pradesh.
The department has received information about bringing the debris from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The consignment of Mave is being transported from the transport garage to Nagpur.
The police seized the vehicle, which was valued at Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not endanger anyone.
The department treated it as an undeclared property and destroyed it.
The department raided Jitendra Caters in Quetta Colony and recovered a sum of Rs 5,000 from him.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to make it glow and last longer.
The samples will be sent to the laboratory.
Joint commissioner of the department SS Deshmukh said that the campaign to capture chemically fortified sweets and spicy and fake maize would continue.
In the next few days, the department has been informed about the expedition and expedition.
These sweets can also be poisonous.
The department asked the sweet traders to make sweets from good milk, maize.
The department has appealed to the people to be wary of fake sweets and maws.
He was received by 42 senior BJP leaders at the airport.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar for a consecration visit by the BJP.
The yatra is being organised by the BJP to offer condolences to the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
A total of seven blasts took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen militants involved in the blasts was to stage a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were killed and an atmosphere of terror was created in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Leaders of the party have been on a visit to his village since Thursday.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will flow together in the Ganga in Patna.
It is part of this journey.
The film stars Narendra Modi in the lead role.
He will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday.
During the visit, he will also provide a cheque of five rupees to the kin of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial aid.
India will take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
To stay in the series after being washed out for two consecutive ODIs due to rain, India had to win Nagpur ODIs in any recent time and its batsmen gave it a record win by performing explosively, making the team equal to 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has scored more than 350 runs twice and once again it will be the batsmen's responsibility to cross the line.
The Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the bigger target is also proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have great expectations for the team.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got an opening pair that is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he made a brilliant partnership in the opening, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli's performance at number three so far is considered to be the future of Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have called him even better than Sachin Tendulkar.
Virat, who will turn 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India has won 16.
Chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the finest finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings lifeline can work for him in Bangalore ODIs.
As far as Australia is concerned, his batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
There is also a demand for him to be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voggs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make an impact in the opening.
The lack of Mitchell Johnson in the bowling could be a huge blow for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home for the preparations for the Ashes series.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said Pakistan was working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the pretence of peace.
Referring to reports by intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here, Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists in its training camps set up around 2000.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has been in turmoil after separatists tried to destabilise the situation in Kashmir.
Referring to the separatists' visit to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, LeT, Hizb chief Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be airlifted in 2014.
Pakistan is firmly committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killings of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Describing the demand to abolish the privileges of the Army in the state in such a situation as lethal, the BJP leader said it was anti-people to do such things till there was a lasting peace in the state.
They are the anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements of leaders, army and security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. vigilance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence informant, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond about their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr. Snowden Segura in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to speak about his testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr. Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: “Although the outcome of my efforts is credibly positive, my government treats disagreements as parties-changes, and offers no defense that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of hooliganism.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abdicate criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include the theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit online: “Mr. Snowden has been willing to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained after the NSA claimed that it had hacked Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who chairs the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. said that if Mr. Snowden had the opportunity to hear as a witness “without completely ruining relations with the United States and putting them in danger,” it should still be taken.
Mr. Straw Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on the Twitter feed.
He was on a trip to Russia with two German journalists.
According to former NSA contractor lawyers, Snowden is not able to return to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had "failed a horrific and persistent campaign" and was forced to leave his home.
However, he said the world is happy and overwhelmed by widespread responses "to his work of political expression."
World citizens, including the United States, as well as higher authorities, have weighed in on the revelations of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines Carry - Charges on Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store luggage on-board for passengers on its aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire box.
New Carry - On duty is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 would have to wait if passengers waited to pay until they were at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be earned to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
The airline began charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid charges are filling in as much as they can carry-on baggage which is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means this compartment often has less space.
Fee is one way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the place of the overhead bin.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay for it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a uniform bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said that the Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers are aware of the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry - on fees, won't start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airlines prefer them.
They argue that it costs money to handle the baggage, and travelers who want the service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as an indication that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of the time, though, the carry-on bag charges are not even touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first launched Carry-On Fee three years ago, and partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
One such fee, along with the other airline, is Hungary's Wizz Air, which tracks add-on fees, airline advisor J. Sorensen said.
He said Spirit's Carry-On Fee brings in $50 million a year, which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines, recently flew in Spirit and surprised passengers who had to face unusual baggage fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was intuitive," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he said it hit the rickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that the traveler who will take soda, or juice, can keep the entire box, and this free coffee will only be given for one time.
This will keep the water away.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but the passengers complained seven months after they withdrew and followed after no other major airlines were there.
Frontier's move to charge a fee on Carry-On if Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is its latest attempt to operate customers towards its own website.
The airline pays the online travel vendor Orbitz such as $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
This is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many often started giving half a flight mile to customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by up to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seats in advance for single travelers when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republicans are trying to decide Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
NSA Accused of "Internal Error" Instead of Hackers for Crashing Websites
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website had been shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiencies, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
"The NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight, due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-determined update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved this evening.
This claim is not true that this hurdle, distributed denial of service, came about due to [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was shut down for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still inaccessible.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network had "not even reached an agreement."
No classified information is in jeopardy, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a large amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, which was never named "No such agency", has become a subject of much debate and bitter criticism among the general public over the past months due to the influx of foreign and domestic espionage programs - the secret of the collectively dismantled NSA and the secret NSA files by former contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to this growing controversy about the agency, there were speculations after tonight's incident that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
Beautiful expressions were presented in conformity with the plot of 'Another Dronacharya' showing harmony between the Dwapar era and the circumstances of today.
In today's context, it was shown in which chains a guru is bound and forced to walk the wrong path.
The play was launched jointly by Prabhudayal Valmiki, the chief guest at the Auditorium of St Joseph Inter College, Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh, vice-chairmen of the Cantonment Council.
The play depicts the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and one Professor Arvind.
Directed by Anil Sharma, the play features Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Ranshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, etc.
The lighting of the play was designed by young painter Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were conferred on the literary and cultural contributions of the participants.
Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, head of the Urdu department of Charan Singh Viv, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorist Jitendra C Raj were also present on the occasion.
Among those who contributed to the success of the event were secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi and others.
Bombardier's profits fall as delivery of aircraft, orders fall
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and less than that on contract issues as pressured by aircraft orders and deliveries.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or introduce an update on issues the aircraft will complete its ambitious program of moving into commercial service from next September.
About a month and a half after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has just been flown three times, questioning whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell below the forecast and the stock has sent for more than 8 percent sliding at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst stock with the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating for "field performance" from "math" on Thursday, limiting the stock to up over the next one or two quarters.
"While weak aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSseries as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut through the low end of the Boeing and Airbus-dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the results of the flight test to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as per the pucca order for CSeries are up to 177 medium.
With 15 customers and operators of 403 total orders and commitments available.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time the first jets were put into commercial use.
Officials reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was running as per schedule.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than anticipated," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding it was also determined by land testing and software updates during the aircraft's interruption.
Every manufacturer creates a schedule in a different way.
We had decided to make a first flight and an updated period and said what we have done.
That will all be through the flight program.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts believe customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier said it evaluated the Admissions Service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our view that the service at the entrance will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year earlier, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenues of 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said that 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago.
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train maker, the division, had a nearly 11 percent increase in revenue for $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backloged at $32.6 billion approximately as of September 30, up modestly from December 31.
Some of the larger contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
New guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter, executives said.
Bombardier's shares, including Google Inc.'s chief financial officer Patrick Pichett Board, also fell by 8.5 percent in mid-morning trade on Thursday at C$4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly gains on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
You don't lie to anyone, and you don't think about stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we start to go against the rules by putting the ideal aside.
Researchers at Harvard University and Utah's David Eccles School of Business have given many interesting facts.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values when there is no stress at work in the morning, but honesty is reduced by fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point is higher on the left or higher on the right.
Participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
The experiment showed that people who were tested between 8 am and 12 am did not make a mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting with people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles on the watch.
This has enabled researchers to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
The study was published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the miscreants fled away.
The family members of the deceased have been admitted to a hospital in serious condition.

Cocaine addicted lawyer who gave secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big jailed
The 42-year-old Bashart Ditta reported to the infamous criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people might find out about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The defence’s top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, as he feared people would know about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
After compromising on his cocaine addiction, 42-year-old Brashat Ditta used to provide sensitive confidential information to the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash", and praised by criminals as "Top Brief," was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
Authorities had spotted the 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine in a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation after Ditta's hair, his wallet, and cocaine particles were found in his credit card, revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of Category A drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, she attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and its associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into the Heroin and Cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Mercedes, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons in it, who were sent to jail after being seized of heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash, during several raids by the police.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to criminals because she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was facing failure in Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing justice after a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted about having cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad timing began when police discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011, while investigating Scarborough.
The two spies chased the suspect and spotted him entering Ditta's house and holding more than 60 per cent purity of drugs under the lawyer's bin in a black golf glove.
Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta after he was placed on drugs, who went out for dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that drugs were kept there and there were nine conversations between them.
The court heard that it had found a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial when evidence of a class A narcotic drug was found on Ditta's hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine, saying he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client and that his discussion was a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to remove many credit cards, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, she said she used to run an office from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients used to call her home for legal matters.
After being told by the main persons who were arrested what the detectives knew about them, the court heard that Ditta used to call the heads of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier submitted the case.
Annie White on behalf of the prosecution stated: "The criminal lawyer should be best aware of not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, connecting too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the general narcotics dealer, but about the dealer who is providing narcotics to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal without any doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his limit of lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but humiliating.
He drew a lot closer to certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed his freedom to compromise.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent of Lancashire Police Lee Halstead said: “At the time Mr. Ditta began receiving drugs from organized criminals, he transformed himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal.”
Due to his cocaine addiction, he became overly compromised and much more vulnerable to the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain critical information related to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has cheated with this belief and has tried to escape in the shadow of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire investigated Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the US, to be Muhammad Ali's dinner guest, and to be the inspiration for her work.
Kenya's press outraged over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying “it’s a frightening place, and it’s legitimate to ask: What’s to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in tomorrow?”
"This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - one of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio stations and news website CapitalFM.
He said the new media tribunal would "always remain biased, as it is part of the government" and said that banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to the MPs," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government "strict control over the media," while The Standard said Kenya's democracy and freedom of speech were "seriously shaken" and described the bill as "brutal."
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an Islamic gunman attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of the troops sent to the site of the attack, showing them looting the mall with intent, causing authorities to be outraged by the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had sent summons to two journalists and a media worker for questioning, although the summons were withdrawn after the media raised a ruckus.
Under the new bill, media companies could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and one million Kenyan shillings, and the additional risk of being "removed from the list" or not being recognized by the official press.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the infringer if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single penalty is enough to shake the foundation of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects on what is described as Kenya's "living blogospheric."
By shutting down the media, politicians know that they can do their will.
The nation’s journalist Mutuma Mathew writes describing Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life “no one will ever know.”
"They will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and gatherings when politicians are left behind,"" he wrote."
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored nearly 532,000 shillings per month, the tax-free bodybuilder's salary, considered one of the world's highest.
World's richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's wife's birthday is on November 1 but as the clocks rang twelve on the night of October 30, the entire Jodhpur was echoed by Nita Ambani's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was completely created with the performance of AR Rahman's team.
At 8 pm, Rahman presented his signature song at the musical knight.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage for a dance performance.
Nita Ambani arrives in Jodhpur with 32 charters for her birthday celebrations.
The charter was held in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur due to reduced parking space at the Jodhpur airport.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW and Juggernaut were invited.
The city's sanitation system, street lights have completely failed, Sood said.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He demanded that Panchkula should be completely abolished.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors but they do not have the power to get the work done.
As a result, the councillors of the city have become a dummy and the officers are working according to their own terms.
Sood said the municipal corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being deposited in banks as FDs and interest is being charged.
But no steps are being taken to invest the money in the development of the city.
V.K. Sood said that the problem of doping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of doping grounds in Sector 23, people living in Ghaggar cross-sectors have been forced to live a hellish life for the past several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the doping ground in village Jhuriwala for the past several years, but people in Barwala area are already getting two-fourths due to the serious fly problem.
He said the health and education system in the villages had deteriorated.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in the rural areas.
U.N. sets new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations is soon to begin work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
In order to replace the MDD, which ended in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the "Sustainable Development Goals" just before the Sustainable Development Summit that began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "raise above national interests."
"I am very happy that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the Universal Sustainable Development Goals," he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do my best to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to meet our long-term objectives of sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns escalate as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambique's founding president Samora staring down at them, thousands gathered in central Maputo to call for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, CEO of an investment company.
Terrified of the future of his country, he changed his corporate dress from a T-shirt printed in Portuguese "We Seek Security" and joined the crowd at the Capital Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years before a peace deal was reached.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-fledged conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign investors and locals.
The bets are high for the fast-growing economy, and some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni, could bring investments of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the major political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict by launching an attack on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Ray Namo fort, on October 17
The attack on the former rebels and the escalation of the attacks led to government forces attacking Renmo bases and trying to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Mazang, a spokesman for Ray Namo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the clash, accusing him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Zibuzhan has called for disrespecting concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whatever it is, his armies are still trying to prove that he can enforce his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mahang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled by Ray Namo but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT that the agreement is not being awarded by Free Limo.
"Our vision is to come back to the negotiating table, but seriously," Mr. Mahanangai said.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease the strain of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men fighting together (Jibuzhan and Dhaka)," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambican expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor are they willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by the government to win concessions and economic loot.
Ray Namo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Ray Namo member with the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mazang, who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy, says Mr. Jibuzhanko.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to quit the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mahang said.
It is not clear what kind of capacity Ray Namo has, but it has been a major hit-and-run tour of disruptive police stations and vehicles on the north-south highway.
Most of the clashes take place in Sofa La province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with the host Bira port that relies on exporting coal to miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, Rio suspended its use for nearly a week following a threat to attack the Ray Namo line.
When asked whether Ray Namo would be able to repeat this threat or not, Mr. Mahangavinit was almost certain.
Ray Namo "Things weren't going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," said Mr. Majhang.
The government of instability further exacerbated the frustrations, called Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent flooding of kidnappings.
"People are the government and the president, the people responsible for the country's future, and think he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace then, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "myths and legends as models for a way of life author."
Thor's stories could have shown "there is no counter to all subtle tricks in brutal power," while the Arturian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
To teach many of the myths even "exceptionally far away from the wild and in some cases it would not be appropriate to teach it even in porn and schools," Cross-Lee Holland advocated a "precautionary selection" of one of the appropriate actions of age.
"I think it's amazing, in America, myth and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I've been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called the writers and teachers "more comprehensible" and it is "a new twist" for children, with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon as well as penguin books of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said: “You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between writing an adult writer for a child and writing an adult writer for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything has to be simplified or come to a happy end, because but it is a spontaneous feeling of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than told revealed through a story.
The old base is not showing.
CHANDIGARH: Head constable Om Prakash retired after serving in the police department for 32 years.

He provided better services during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in the U.S.: nearly a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fay, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling jokes directly to people sitting in the crowd in the way they interacted.
Fey's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, to the New York Comedy Fossil.
The festival, composed and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute Caroline Hirsch, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared in Carolines, and became a huge success, to a level where they became too big to play at the club," says Hirsch.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Mayer, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" that included Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as comedies coming from smaller networks like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll, the joyous "The League" from the deep-cable sitcom (FXX) with the "Ronchi Fantasy-Football Theme") reached the prime spot, and now has his own comedy-centric sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Satterday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate (Anthony Jesslinick, a satirical, ethnic-focused W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the celebration will be, an interview with David Steinberg's Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but he has become a nominee television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the DNA of Larry's comedy of all the works," Steinberg said.
They were telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down the street between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would be here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 a barrel
A report of concerns about more supplies, such as Friday's fall in oil prices, is offsetting where the power-hungry manufacturing sector in China is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery in electronic trading on the US crude New York Mercantile Exchange was down 14 cents in Europe at $96.24 per barrel until late in the morning.
The contract fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestive surge in activity of strong demand has revealed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing arrived on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a two-decade low of 7.8 percent in the third quarter last year.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents on the ICE exchange in London from $108.58 a barrel, a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's suspension and sports policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked changes requiring a judge's order for the New York Police Department's pause and play program and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & Judge Shira Schindeler has said that the judgment will be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city had ruled in August in violation of the Constitution in the manner it did to stop people and exclude their program of interrogation.
The city's police department has appealed its findings and its remedial orders, including its policy and the decision to allocate a surveillance to help change the training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard the pleas on Tuesday.
The appellate court has said that since it compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid bias in a series of media interviews and misrepresented the US judge's code of conduct by the public, it should be removed from the judge's case, to criticise the court of statements in public.
The judge had ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and sports program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including policies, training and economic reforms in supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test the body-wearing cameras in some campuses where the most closures occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police pause.
An oral argument on the appeal of the Municipality is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and sporting tactics have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and play policy has been around for decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 has been recorded to a free Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration preventing dramatic growth.
A case was filed in 2004 by four men from all minorities and became a class action case.
Proponents of the NYPD's pause and change in sports program have said that improper behavior will end up molding a more reliable and effective police force and other police department's policy can influence the use of..
Opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but will solve a wider problem of crime, wasting money and a police force under pressure after not shrinking by thousands of officials over the past decade.
The judge noted that the pause and termination had not been put for the sport, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were informed about various disciplines including tent pitching, flag poles.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
By participating in all religions prayer, all the participants are spreading the spirit of unity.
Vipin Kumar, head of the camp, is giving special support to the state education commissioner.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Coulson, former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to verify a so-called secret information about his romance while he was Charles Clarke's home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby's voicemail and "keep an eye on" the male, but Colson also called and dropped his voicemail.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is currently the editor of the NOTW, is not known to be standing outside people's homes and keeping an eye on them, but rather to put articles in front of people, to see how people react to them," said Mr. Addis.
He said that the NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one included the editor himself.
He knew the other way around, he certainly knew the other way around.
What about the first one?
Do you know anything about phone hacking?
He said, "No, I know, I know."
The rumor about Clark's romances was first introduced by the AOTW's feature desk when a sexually aroused source in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
From Mulcair to home in August 2006, the tape of voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Polby's phone.
The investigators also found entries in the computer of the private investigator on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "projects".
During the period during which he was being examined, Ms. Polby's grandparents used to call anonymously and ask for information about him.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watched the arrival of Ms. Polby.
On June 18, 2005, through a voicemail to him, Colson told him: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, about which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles."
Coulson's involvement in the case is in the parson with other important persons, such as former home secretary David Blankett, he said.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had a conversation with Mr. Blinket about the romantic relationship with a married woman, while he was looking at the case of co-respondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to enter into a contract with others to hack their phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking the phone.
NSA's disclosures about state surveillance have fueled corporate fears.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter landed at the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, was to take a picture of the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of lissing antennas and signaled an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. "does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies' trade secrets and increase U.S. companies' international competitiveness or bottom line."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who is a whistleblower, began to tell American surveillance the treasures of his secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if the director will keep his word.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras, and our cloud providers Google and Yahoo and others expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful individuals in Europe can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also targeting potential.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy of German companies, the U.S. has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all documentation, however, there is no evidence to date that the U.S. knew the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of the EU’s internet capabilities. And it should make efforts to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gently open them again...
Hasso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said "it's no way."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he wouldn’t have died 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal, cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about U.S. technological sophistication and spying access have proven to be a shock to some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come across a year ago – that is – how my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically within that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and should therefore be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage takes place.
It has always happened.
"It's been a topic for many years, and through fundamentally current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
US commercial and industrial levels spy on us, and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defence system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it is unwise to record messages for a long time whether it is taking a USB stick from home in business, or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member of car maker Audi, says it's a one-year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to the risks on foreign tours.
The prepaid mobile phone was later discarded.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, this number of companies is at the forefront of the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of its own companies.
According to France The Washington Post, in February, the name of the US national intelligence was named in a second tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to economic espionage, "French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: “Services know well that all countries spy on their allies even if they join in non-terrorist combat.”
US commercial and industrial levels spy on us, and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one is stupid.
Georgia's teenaged man killed in accident believes his son was murdered
A Georgian teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a resting mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, family lawyers said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators at the Londs County Sheriff’s office concluded Johnson died in a “unfortunate accident,” but the 17-year-old’s family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Crump, who presents Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that he "absolutely believes his son was murdered."
They don't believe in the way the sheriff told them about death at all.
"They believe this is beyond the logic of physical laws and common sense," Krump said.
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mueller said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My goal is to bring out the truth.
"I am of the view that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporter that initial autopsies indicated Johnson's death was a result of a "state-of-the-art respiratory failure."
According to Murray, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death."
"There are so many questions that should be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some indication of how he died.
CDC issues Allergy Guidelines for Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling children's food allergies in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle them in case of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep the stock of epinephrine to cope with potentially deadly aphrodisiacs - the auto-injector of the epinephrine brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep the stock of epinephrine in excess.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pissing in my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Intersex Kids Parents Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Gender Undefined’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for babies born with vagus genitals.
Newborns will no longer be designated male or female in a conventional way.
According to the new law, parents are not required to declare sex for such children, which allows them to declare sex ‘unspecified’ or ‘unspecified’ on the child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who may make hasty decisions regarding gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I will continue to be an injured, stained bandage made by doctors.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children born every year is a boy or a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which come under investigation of sexual development disorders, is a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitalia (ovarian or testicular), or abnormally developed penis.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender-determination cannot occur, it is better to use the best information available to specify the gender and observe the psychological and physical development of the child before performing surgery, if such a diagnosis occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-identification cases, said Germany’s new law “appears to be a good thing.”
Intersex children create moral dilemmas.
"Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that's not the case with most children," he said.
You can specify the gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a penis will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
In a report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described differently than transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender, but to their biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor female, but is either a combination of the two or neither of the two is clearly defined.
These traits can manifest themselves as secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
There are now special camps for non-conforming gendered boys.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to mark a male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to hold an "unspecified" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passport will also have a third specification in the form of X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, gender-related issues in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed petitions to withdraw "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposes Germany’s legislation, saying, “While the world is going to a stage where gender itself is the choice, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see the babies being assigned a gender at the time of birth.
He said on the website about raising, "Raising without additional restrictions is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and security.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the beautiful Greek deity who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the penis as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now that many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are realizing that gender-identification is a complex task, and can sometimes be mistaken by physicians who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Drescher says “in the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a “psychiatric emergency.”
When these babies were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hapkins University, who considered the penis to be plausible.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - are determined by interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a male or as a female.
But in a case of the year 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had been accidentally penis during the circaxation to tie the child up and remove the testicles and raise her like a girl.
"Money presented that case as a successful case of transfer, but it did not happen," Drescher said.
At the age of 15, the child changed back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, individuals undergoing these penis surgeries began to come out "not happy with the results."
A similar case was with the 36-year-old author of Montana, Jim Bruce, who was born with an X.Y. male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
The doctors didn't clearly understand that his penis was short, or his clitoris was large, but they were sure he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So in the year 1976, shortly after she was born, Bruce's outer organs and testicles were removed by surgery and raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," she told ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, she was about to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and something went wrong, she demanded medical records.
This revealed to him the terrible truth.
I was tied up at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone supplements and removing his breasts.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people to generalize their perception of intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project.
But, Annie Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expressed concern that Germany’s law “invites chippys and stigma.”
“Many activists feel that Germany’s law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and specify the child as “undefined,” she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, it is better to specify a male or female gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex,” he said.
Germany's law relates to specifying the time of birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborn babies at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "strengthenify both parents and children."
Baratzi's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen receptor was defective, female traits developed in Katy.
He has a vagina in his body but no uterus or ovaries.
Katie, now 29, is married and is a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents not to make hasty decisions on their own," Baratz said.
It provides them with proper understanding and time by some test before they write ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a sweet baby and have fun with it.
We do not need to have surgery in a hurry which cannot be returned.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees them from the ambiguity that motivates parents because they don't believe they're doing well," he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex he or she is more comfortable with -- and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar, organised a legal awareness camp under the chairmanship of Sub-Judge Sandeep Kaur at Ramnagar Middle School, Dalher.
In which students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and Sarpanch spoke on the issue and made the people aware.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Report: Considering the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as Vice President for the 2012 ticket.
The most notable explosion in Revelation is the massively anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Hellemann, Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "widespread group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to learn what dumping Biden could do in the fall hopes of Obama's re-election.
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the efforts of the chief executives in the campaign and the White House, for the name of the former White House staff chief, to find out what impact the shift from former Secretary Clinton to Vice President has on the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret both within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close presidential advisers – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlarod and David Palauffe – knew the change was under consideration.
The "double down" claim that Dale tried to change Biden, despite his personal harmonies, before finally making a decision when he was informed that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's condition.
In an interview with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said keeping an eye on the whole scene, and one of them, it was," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember when the presidency was in danger, and we were in a situation like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dale described the research as "a cautionary tale," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out how much dividend the claim would pay when polled.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focused groups like money unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, Halaki, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss was aware of a possible altercation.
While Dale said he "didn't think the president was aware of the potential change," the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" sure: Will not answer whether the political inquiry reached Obama's desk? Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama wasn't aware of the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Do you like the Glow-in-the-Dark Ice Cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first globe-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has made great use of sea animals to develop the best breakfast.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists used chemical glitter to re-glaze proteins.
Ice cream will increase the pH of the protein by reacting with the tongue and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream shines with the heat of the mouth, that is, the more you lick, the more it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the Lick Me My Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: “It’s an incredible thing at the beginning of production I’ll get about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms up, the protein will raise the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing for the last few months and it feels perfect to share on Halloween as it gives amazing glowing effects
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the brightness of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, the taste of Iska is very good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its apnoea abnormal taste, including beer, cheese, meat, and gold leaf.
But his next creation is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It's impossible to do this naturally because of the ice crystals that make up the refraction over ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utilitarian quality of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market in the Rani Bagh market was dotted with customers.
People had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
The same was seen in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Similar sightings were also seen at the shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver jewellery and coins.
Due to this, there was a traffic jam in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, those who left the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play for the dress-up neighborhood.
Today, I've become more than a fan.
I haven't even signed up to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and probably won't be this year either.
But statistics show that there is a black sheep when halloween arrives.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually spending $158 million this time celebrating Halloween, $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and costumes and decorations.
One of the things that I've always wanted to do is look at the Halloween costumes.
According to the NRF, the total cost of clothing is estimated to be $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion.
This year, everyone is angry about the sex inanimate objects.
Women don't have to be prostitutes, because they're also sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
I hope for the men a lot of zombies, and thanks to the moving dead, the space will create our Instagram feeds for the men this year.
According to Google, the most-searched costumes will be zombies, Batman, robbers and spiders.
I don't think there's anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed up as dogs and, surprisingly, we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million on pet clothing.
That's the irony that a lot of hotdogs have with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairy Bars, Lollipop, Milk Dudes, Twishers, and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are going to take part in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we're going to buy what we're joking about for 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners' Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween is candycorns, but they will also sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion individual lumps of maize.
This is a mystery. So far to solve
There is nothing more fundamental than the Halloween ghost house.
They are the best names, like "The Terror Behind the Wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chikh-o-Chikh" and "House of Shock."
In fact, according to American power, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million royalties. And those awesome pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the guy who likes you and comments nice face.
Finally, let's talk about the kayak.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not living with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-o's slow-moving lantern on his front porch was probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for additional loans, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin on the phone Tim and Susan Matisses in Napa, Caliph., and above.
It was decided to issue a postage stamp containing Sachin's photo during the pre-match presentation before the start of the match.
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
Apart from this, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be handled by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure, which will include articles related to Tendulkar and statements about him by people from the business, sports and journalistic world.
The limited number brochure and coins will be distributed to members of MCA and BCCI, the association said.
He said 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 caps will be distributed every day with Sachin's photos.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
It has racing seats in the interior and a six-point harness belt, as well as an intercom system.
Its options include - upgraded brakes, service packages that provide access to the vehicle collection between baller works mechanics, logistics support, and events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers coming into the bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure and a path that can lead to world-class events.
We are very pleased to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format provides a new way to experience different Rally modes in the UK and abroad, and prepares the competitor for the rigor and truth of the Rally Rad.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be a really fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenger will offer training and testing days in the month of February as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area has not come true.
The firecrackers have been trapped in the Mazda after the High Court order.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary firecracker market built at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licences to do business in the transport area.
The commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
The deputy commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs 10 lakh for lack of proper management.
The High Court, in its order, has strongly reprimanded the administrative officials of Amritsar for what task such an administration has failed to solve even a single problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not find a suitable place in the city.
Thereafter, appropriate security arrangements were made and firecracker traders were asked to issue licences for the business in the market at Nhayagarh.
Though the firecrackers were happy after the order, the police on Friday discarded their happiness.
A team of the Astha license branch of the police reached the firecracker market and sold the farm by installing counters there.
It was impossible to fulfill the conditions that were then told to him in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Incharge of Aslaha Licensing Branch Anoop Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licences were not issued to firecrackers.
There is only one day left for Diwali.
Due to this, the firecrackers are inconvenienced.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecrackers Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will file a claim against the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecrackers marched from Bhangarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, the temporary fireworks market at Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost puppy at the mouth of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after arriving in a small road collision
He was spotted by a dog walker trapped in a mine three days later.
Firefighters lowered the front portion of the cliff from the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After Papi somehow got stuck on the mouth of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground, the firefighters were called to give him a lucky life.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after being hit by a road accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappy Mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and he has praised the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, he had searched for his lost dog like crazy, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 p.m., a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, on a mountain in a mine at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and dropped Ruby by a rope to save her and used a belly tube to bring her down from the rock.
Expert technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front of the cliff, 50 feet above and below.
He did not make a single move during the defence, she remained a stone.
But now he is good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has escaped fortunately."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work"
At first I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to have him back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What they have done is indeed a great thing.
We admired them, and they were all great.
Mr. Elderson from Kigali also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did a great job.
I don't know how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn't hit her when she was 18
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Starr said he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with senior rocker, and he hit me when I was 18.
“This thing got old, and he treats me well,” he said.
The 70-year-old Jaeger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly refuses to ever hit Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perry, probably, is saying about him in the misconception of another person."
Perry was one of the singers to come as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prisma" reached the top this week.
George Carrigan: The European Union's decision to abolish the death penalty
Another day, another story of fear of freedom.
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport controls on Barwick and the barbed wire boundary on Hadrian's walls indicate stories.
True, the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it did not describe it in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as needed.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, there will be an affordable discount for persistent non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what Brussels really wants from Scotland.
Therefore, then, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long is frozen. First I heard the unfounded news of "freedom means passport control" almost 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting point was lost in recounting this interesting old story.
Why should we expect independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why is London's Yoke being sold to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the crisis in Europe, the project has officially died.
Throughout the EU, teams dedicated to opposing the EU or closing the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - which was founded only this year - suddenly came out and garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively excluding the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis proved radical.
Along with the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that the project Europe has gone too far due to the constraints imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not play much of a role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favour of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public spending – which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity morbidity beyond the current budget and monetary problems.
To provide concessions to French and German energy firms on consumer spending - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United Nations.
This is the paralysing cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even with all the pay freezes in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be spared from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, a sense of insurgency is raging among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians saw the EU as a measure to keep Germany under control, and Paris as a measure to provide the world with the same billing as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to slump.
Result: Marianne Lee Paine's right-wing anti-EU National Front has won by pushing the ruling socialist to the third spot in the recent by-elections.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it's a timely warning to the British Labour that they can't go by assuming that the disintegration for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Lee Paine doing with his newfound fame in the middle of the French white working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, anti-money laundering faction in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the EU's opposition parties perform well in these elections, such a faction could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: the confluence of anti-EU and anti-money laundering sentiment in Europe will soon end the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will return to a form of "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that will be backed by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its retaining economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of raising close ties with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific signals that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to remain (necessarily) the territory of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while walking the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland has been - notably - the most successful anti-capitalist political campaign in Europe, which won an astonishing majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dem Coalition to oppose (and implement) cuts proposed by Labour's Chancellor Alastair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature adolescence: Growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at a younger age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at an early age.
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheriz, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist on children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter starts developing breasts and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Caplowitz made it clear that these early physiological changes are common among American girls, reflecting the new trends.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – that generally it does not reflect rapid progress toward full puberty,” says Caplowitz.
Direct signs of development such as breast sprouts, genital and eye hair and physical odor are visible in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstrual cycle).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, the first rajodarshan takes at least two to three years,” explains Caplowitz, who is also the author of “Premature puberty in girls: the necessary guide to dealing with this common problem.”
This is the most accurate test time for the development of puberty.
There is debate about what the onset of puberty is, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two call it "child-adult."
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by a pediatrician.
In case of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may be required to examine the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments for delaying premature menstruation and other outcomes are: premature ageing of osteoporosis, which can lead to undeveloped growth and stagnation as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, “pressing youth can exacerbate behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel isolated from their peers.”
The second big problem can be understood: parents simply don't want their younger daughter to have menstrual cramps.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene,” Caplowitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, “It was a shock.”
Although there were signs of this and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from her school frightened and upset that she had first started menstruating among her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexually oriented messages in the media can be charged.
Boys - just like girls - are getting premature puberty.
Caplovitz sets out the rules that the main cause of this is an outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001, which combines body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get puberty before their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of puberty as a whole is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians present at the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Gorayab Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean negotiating before the expected time," advised Caplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond appropriately.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Jet manufacturers' big orders from controversy for seat width at stake.
This month's Dubai Airshow has become a hotbed of controversy among leading aircraft makers for the widening of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy class seat on long-haul aircraft, not always given by airlines but the location efficiency of which is claimed to be key by Latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus expects such an industry standard to be at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide at the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by airlines, says its chief rival Boeing
The controversy comes after the aircraft makers were hesitant to sell a larger version of the long-range twin engine of the Aircraft, one of the possible orders filed after the 17-21 incident.
How has the previous section of the aircraft been designed - especially if the seat is equal to 9 or 10? The designs of the mini jumbo jets are being designed keeping in mind the demand for more capacity?
Boeing says it has created a "777 X" that will accommodate 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in the economic department.
Airbus says it will take 350 people to the 18-inch 9-seat equivalent seat, leaving the A350 with an A350.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X expected to dominate over 100 orders in Dubai Airshow, this is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the Vigilance War has been the beginning of anything, showing this to Fincenro, will you accept it all three together in a restaurant?
Airbus sales chief John Leahy said, "Boeing is also offering long-haul flights from regional turbochargers to narrow-seaters."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to the U.S. Department of Health data, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 jumbo ne modern long-haul ki ko tha, and the century's an average 40-49-year-old American male ke me weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waist of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals are sticking to a 1950s seat concept when the new name "Jet Set" had an average circumference narrower.
Airbus said it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent inch in the width of the seat to improve the quality of sleep.
Boeing has disputed Airbus's seat measurement data, saying it does not depend on manufacturers' decision on how airlines balance between fares and facilities.
Also, research suggests that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin.
“This really shows flexibility to airlines and what they believe they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Kraver, a Boeing cabin expert.
"They don't want to tell us what they're worth."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it’s about the elbow room, but for suppliers it’s increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
At least $700 billion worth of trade is projected to be behind the controversy, with aircraft order competition enough in the coming decades to tip the scales of American and European exports.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, the question of whether the seat layout is really a fight between the new jets was raised.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that their new twin-engine design had a 20 per cent performance per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er.
Boeing's performance claims depend on the 10 with the 777 X One compared to the original 9 with the 777 design.
10 equals with profit in unit cost has now been used comparison.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe’s Airbus Passenger Facility, said: “Boeing’s doing this to capture more seats, to make their aircraft more competitive with our products.”
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the current 777 S suggests that many passengers are in favor of a denser layout, which can go along with cheap fares at the same time.
"The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of the offer 777," said Meri Karby, a cabin interior expert, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Jet sellers from all over the world also take precautionary measures to check on this layouts competition.
More relaxed, all builders are also offering low-cost airlines and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10-equal A350 but says it has not been sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on wide-ranging cabin seats on some of its jets for the need for more cabin facilities.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it could distract from the 777 X sales wave.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccines Can End the Joy of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which may take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weal Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs were positive.
"We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine could eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is far more potent than these existing methods," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been designed to transmit genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the nicotine from rising inside the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the vaccinated mice, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the rat who was not vaccinated "feeled good," the researchers say, was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they contained antibodies.
It had to be given at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as it will make the liver cell a factory of antibodies.
If the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction, said Professor Crystal.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they will not get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the postmortem, the actual cause of death of the tiger could not be ascertained.
The forest department has been responding to the death of the tiger in the first instance.
The body of a tiger was found near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Canal on Thursday night.
All the parts of the body of the tiger were safe and there were no marks of wound or injury etc. on him.
The post-mortem examination of the body was conducted by CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore in the presence of Forest Conservation Officer Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kahaksha Nasim, SDO GS Karki.
According to sources, the inner body of the tiger is said to have been damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
The departmental officials were responding to the attack.
However, the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for a topological examination to confirm the poisoning.
"""The tiger's death can be termed as a natural death,"" forest guard Vivek Pandey said."
No signs of poison etc. were found from the body of the tiger.
However, a search is on in the area and a probe is being sent to confirm the poisoning.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by the obsession.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody will be examined by the State Corps Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the policy on sea leases at the request of his political guru Eddie Obaid, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obaid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the probe into whether Mr. Obaid had approached several State Ministers for violation of the circulars of the leasing policy, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid, without tender, were renewed after the expiry of their time in August 2005.
After evidence by Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, the allegation that Mr. Tripody knew Mr. Obaid's hidden interests is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for the introduction of a public tender for the leases.
The tenants were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprises for leases, which Obaid earned $25 million annually, were renewed from the tenders without the leases.
Shri Tripody, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the public tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripody had requested for a change in the government lease policy
A transcript presented in a phone call ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripody and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries of Mr. Obaid after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripody. “Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case,?”
"No," Mr. Trump answered.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets fired into Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed.
The official did not say what was the motive, but at least one motive was required.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian Missile SA-125.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can undergo an "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on the 457 visa, as it aims to expand a drastic action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457 unskilled positions in Australia from being used to fill or deliver to family and friends in a disguised manner.
Condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McQuaie said today it could anger Australia's neighbours.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and that "the Australians are getting jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safer labour market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some in the area saw the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he met with officials about people smuggling, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsor or the relative or personal companion of the relevant person."
Businesses may need to keep counting the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a smaller number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of suspected heart attack after he boarded a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's troubled nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, his adult cousin, who was on the same ship, was tied to a rope.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island hospital where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland’s benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building the high-speed link between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating Scottish Transportation, directed HS2 Ltd to consider further improving rail capacity and travel timings for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: “Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.”
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be much greater.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capability of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be connected due to HS2 and well.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
"High-speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in terms of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government, so that we can explore options for bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all, and fulfilling the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the British government ministers next year and taking decisions together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will remain in force in Australia
Due to the slowdown in equipment regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left options open to U.S. airlines to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during the crucial stages of flight, provided those devices remain in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this during many flights right now, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and access their e-books at the time of landing.
Australian airlines are considering the decision, according to which U.S. airlines will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective at critical stages of flight in Australia.
"Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulation regulating the utilization of electrical appliances in the aircraft," the authority said, "This issue falls under the regulations, which require aircraft service operations companies to ensure that the safety arrangements are always fully in place, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about extending the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment systems, is ready to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical appliances, because we really feel it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes."
Qantas said it will follow the current rules.
"According to our current policy, electrical appliances cannot be used during flight and landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it," it said.
FAA decisions apply to U.S. airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travellers and we will definitely consider the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each US airline service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruption from mobile devices, as well as modify their rulesbooks, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and provide brief descriptions to passengers.
"Following verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, lightweight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the aircraft.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment under the seat or in upper compartments while flying and landing safely.
Silver of punbrokers due to difficulty felt by middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga, at the Ponshop at Bendmeyer Shopping Centre in Singapore, is taking cash with her gold bangle, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it," said Smt. Amirthalinga.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is on the rise - with ValueMax where they are doing their transactions, becoming the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry mortgages aren't the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga, $1,300 Singapore Dollars - but are also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Generally, Ponbrokers in Singapore charge an interest of 17 percent per annum, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pun brokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of pay, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to Ponshops due to the increasing cost of living by families and the difficulty of increasing domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth following the global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.

It said Asia has the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly this week from a tech slowdown.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slowdown and a decline in consumer demand.
“The decisive point is that with rising prices, [people] from the middle to lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way,” said Song Seng Won, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items held in the city-state's 200-point outlets are gold.
People are saying, "The price of gold looks good, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain, and we'll take it back next month."
Egimeni, Thailand's largest Ponshop operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the business of mortgages that the operator of the outlet in Bendimir, Valemax, and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, in Malaysia where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, says Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valemax.
The company will fund it using 60 per cent of the $66 million it received this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While there has been criticism of some discount lenders due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that mortgages not only get cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers mortgage items they already have, and capitalizing on personal assets does not increase domestic debt," she says.
The social acceptance of Ponbroking for short-term and secure financial assistance is on the rise.
It is not that pony brokers are used only by financially weak people.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, they pledge gold bars or Rolex watches to get up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all sections of the society.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements," says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.

A $325 million rescue package for TAJI's health
The federal government has insisted that strict conditions are also attached to the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's sickening health system, which will ensure that the state government cannot waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis due to the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and systemic limitations.
The decision to fund the four-year period was made in consultation with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilke.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges being faced by the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving past accumulated cases.
It also includes funds for the introduction of walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lancaster, better post-hospital care, training of medical experts, mental health services and personal electronic health records system in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best ways I’ve been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and each month report where additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission shall be constituted to ensure that the service is rendered by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkey said $325 million would not mean much unless “real reforms are made to take Tasmania’s public health system to a more sustainable level.”
Yet, he lauded the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.”
“I hope that the federal aid package will prove very helpful towards isolating the state re public health system from the crisis-affected list,” said Mr. Wilkey.
According to the state government, these additional alternate procedures will largely reverse the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement "is a band-aid solution."
"We are here because the Labour State government has taken $430 million in its health system," he told ABCTV.
You can't take the state government's nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth's $300 million as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.

CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose entry fee in the garden due to the dirt in the garden.
At the same time, the departments have been given a 15-day ultimatum to fix the situation.
The Vice-Chancellor conducted a surprise inspection of the Seeds and Fields and Director Research with the Department of Horticulture at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including directors in these departments, to be out of their seats.
After reprimanding him, he warned of salary cuts if found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, in-charge of media at the university, said a pass of Rs 30 will be required for a walk a month.
At a fee of Rs 1 per day, people can go for a walk in the garden.
The system will work: Files related to various tasks before the Vice-Chancellor will be accessed under one system.
Every employee shall not have the right to enter the VC’s office with his/her file.
The officers concerned will reach out to their final Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons.
On Thursday, the monitoring group said Syria had destroyed chemical weapons and critical equipment to make toxic gas war materials, while a fierce conflict erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
On Thursday, the Syrian movement said nearly 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the last date of November 1.
The Hague-based organization designated Damascus to destroy or "ineffective" all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to destroy machinery used to fill war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, primarily, is a significant milestone in this ambitious development aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons in Damascus by the middle of the year 2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections that exist.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
Britain's position, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported, came as clashes erupted in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which details the death toll through a network of protests in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government said 29,954 President Bashar al-Assad's military members, 18,678 fighters fighting for the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead were 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's army fought the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaida groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything explicitly.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in a very short time frame, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team "is satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen - all of Syria's declared significant production and mixing/filling equipment - destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said they had completed the first phase of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by the Dumascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said the two centers were "abandoned and ... chemical weapons products stored there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected," according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira, was one of the two centres where the Inspector of OPCW was not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the executive committee of the OPCW next month.
"I salute the persistence and courage displayed by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission that this organization has ever undertaken,"" said Ahmet Uzumku, Director General of the Monitoring Group in a statement issued by OPCW."
The three-year civil war is primarily a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the apartheid sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said a powerful explosion occurred at the Air Defense Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered the forged registry, forged seals, laptops and photo copies of the forged registry from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the arrested persons were Rajeev Agarwal alias Binttu of Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused along with the registrar office clerk and record keeper Balbir Singh used to collect documents from the records of the vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and prepare forged registry on them.
Then the book of Revelation was revealed, and the book of Revelation was revealed.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land on forged papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they took loans on these forged papers.
After that, the real owner of the land was left to the shocks of the police and the administration.
The accused, who had prepared the forged registry, kept a special eye on the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to take care of the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to create and sell a fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused told that they have prepared about 150 forged registers so far.
According to the police, a case of cheating and theft has already been registered against Rajeev, the leader of the gang.
Blasphemy charges against the perpetrator of the bombing in Bali
The relatives and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombings have expressed their anger over the sentence to be given to the perpetrator of the bombing, saying Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia for almost 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building an explosive device used in the bombing.
If granted parole, he could be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounding many others.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have also demanded that the person infamous as the master person making the bomb be the "destroyer" of the death penalty.
The decision revived the traumatic memories of the woman in Perth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his hopes, he said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other horrific terrorists.
"She should have been placed in front of the firing squad," Ms. Courtin told the AAP."
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the name of the club was removed after the explosion of a bomb loaded into a van parked outside The Sari Club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar just 20 seconds before the explosive-laden bagpack was detonated by suicide bombers.
He went into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and died three times while on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jemmaah Islamiyah terror group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhallas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, 20 years of imprisonment is not enough.
Patek, Bali is the last person to receive punishment from the bombers.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"She did not surrender," says Ms. Courtin.
Even to this day, it's not really the pain of hurting so many people mentally.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Courtin said.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cannot make calls from cell phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - from entering the gate to landing - but not speaking to their cellphones - under the highly-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travellers should not expect these changes immediately.
Speaking at a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
In a statement, the FAA said: "Based on the state of the plan, we can approve the extended use of electronic devices very quickly."
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to not turn on the aircraft until it reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and is permitted by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again at the time of landing, and not turn on the aircraft until it is fully landed.
"""Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic disruptions can allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxiing,"" the FAA said."
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work closely with airline companies to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we're bored feeling like "Hall Monitors."
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting the internet at altitudes less than 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversations with friends, an online Scrabble-like game, the famous incident involving actor Alec Baldwin when he was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the gate in 2011, and American Airlines had him off the plane when he refused to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be collected as their bounce will cause another person to get hurt in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority for phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is a national transport safety expert for CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not only because they can potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers if they're in the air," Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to investigate the issue, last month recommended that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increasing pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Claire McCasquill, D-Mo, have said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming even more difficult to enforce because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when reports of disruptions in navigation and communication equipment were received by passengers carrying FM radios and high-tech gadgets at the time.
New airlines rely more on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruise heights to passengers for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huarta said most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a nominal transmission when the page is turned on.
But transmissions are dominant when the device downloads or sends data.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favour reducing restrictions on the use of the device by travelers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airlines and flew them to test the problems, but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said he believes the disruption to the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
The committee members, however, recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to switch off the device when the aircraft landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common sense facility for those travelling in the latest round of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said: "We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a traveler who travels with pleasure is not incompatible with safety and security.
Learning from the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police have tightened their belts for quick response during Diwali celebrations and during emergency situations in view of security.
A total of 1,800 constables, including vehicles and pedestrians, will patrol all the main places, crowded markets and other places in the city to ensure smooth running of the traffic system, prevention of incidents of rushing, teaching lessons to the people.
The police personnel will be accompanied by PCR, traffic unit and women police personnel.
At hotels, guest houses and other places in the city including PG, police personnel and commandos will also conduct a vigilance check on duty.
The SHO has been directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the matter.
Besides, the DSP has been entrusted with the task of conducting investigations at markets, malls and other places, including the VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the higher officials have also fixed the duty of additional police personnel under police control to facilitate the people.
The police have asked the fire department and the PGI directors, principal directors and DHS, besides the staff of other dispensaries besides the Sector 16 GMSH and Sector 32 GMCH management, to maintain a high alert in case of emergency.
In order to teach a lesson to the people, departmental officials have now put others, including women police personnel, on duty by naming 'anti-gunda staff' under the leadership of the NGO.
The policemen of the anti-gunda staff team will be standing at crowded places, including markets, in plain clothes and arresting the mob.
On Diwali, all the SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the interior of the city.
Police personnel will also be stationed at 38 Naka points on the city borders.
The bird was released back into the forest by air transport to protect it from the North Sea rig.
The bird found dehydrated on the North Sea oil rig has been air transported back to the forest from the coast.
The bird, called the Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by a helicopter before the Scottish SPCA restored it to its Aloe rescue centre.
"This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea," said centre manager Colin Seddon.
It looks like the bird was tired and took shelter on the oil rig.
He further stated that: “It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.”
The water train was healthy and fit before it left.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring the business together and determine what changes the UK's employment and prosperity makers would like to see in our relationship with the EU.
For this, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of the UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the idea of 1,000 business leaders representing UK business sizes, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export outside of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than indulge in a long-term and vicious process of reforming the EU’s mysterious institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas, ranging from monopoly regulation to product legislation, most business leaders believed that control of these crucial qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could have been seen very easily, with businessmen saying that the price of Brussels’ regulation is much higher than the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading sector – even the giant businessmen who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally, and most explicitly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part of the UK clearly wants to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This finding, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are pushing towards a "meaningful change" that would give the UK back its lost power.
It has a very high price – the issue of a treaty change for the UK and a better deal, in the referendum, changed 16 percent of the vote in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: The survey reveals that UK businessmen support his plan to negotiate on the terms of the UK's membership to the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate making a meaningful change to make the current power balance in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly imperative as the eurozone, the contiguous economy and the fiscal union move forward.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey results show that for business people this means a new focus on business and a fundamental shift in Brussels’ regulatory functioning.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom described the pipeline as the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today there has been a historic event: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is for Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant an end to "forever" the geopolitical risks gambling with transit countries.
After the completion of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
In 2011, two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sex offences before being charged against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord.
But in his statement before the commission, it said it had "never reported a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation," the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Gym Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children living with him in the year 1991.
Mr. Hare, an advocate who assisted the Commission, said he was aware of the first case but did not know about the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's statement before the Commission that "YMCA has been examined externally and they have found YMCA at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Quality Audit of the Department of Education and Community in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who has been associated with YMCA since the age of 21, admitted that the management "including myself" failed because of the Lord's appointment, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations relating to reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the breach was evidence of the Lord spending time alone with the children, making them babysitting privately, letting them sit on their lap, telling them that he loves them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and had called for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that YMCA Caringbah Child Care Manager Jackie Barnat, who supervised the Lord, was "very intimidating and hard to get most of the time."
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
Rather, his friendship with the Lord misled his decision to inform him.
Mr. Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NASW Board that, from the "Jonathan Lord incident," the text for the organization was "about not informing."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to get the employees to sign the confidentiality agreement was taken by YMCA's Child Services Manager Liam Whiteley soon after the allegations surfaced.
He said the aim was to avoid the mixing of evidence, but it was not "excited" and properly executed.
Stephen Smallbone, a special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said YMCA N.S.W. was not a safe organization when Jonathan Lord was on the job between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, inspection, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The case has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes a return is unlikely.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a representative of the Middle East group's peacekeepers.
Asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's post, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, sure, but that's unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to showcase the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fentan Kirkland.
Not even gone to school yet and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his palut Shetland pony, Tafi, completed three stages with great ease and won the top prize – overtaking his 30 adult competitors.
At the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Rudrey, near Cardiff, the inseparable pair - the Sk itself - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, she sliced her flat hat at an elongated angle and rounded her two-year-old Toffee with a ring.
The decision makers praised Fentan for his natural ability to control, which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fentan was given the toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has practiced with this pony from Shetland every day since then.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fentan and Toffee are a wonderful couple."
They faced a challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and Rosett.
This was the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
What's more, he felt so amazing that he wanted to take pictures with her.
This little boy from the village of Nantiglu near Ab Well, South Wales, is walking on the footprints of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.

He was running on sand all over the Rangoon, and even though he looked so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fentan is a madman of animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has raised two chickens that he takes care of.
The way he's started, he'll be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I'm sure he'll do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fentan’s age is only three years, but he comes to control his pony.”
They are very good couples.
The decision makers gave the scores given the manner in which Fentan and Toffee performed and the manner in which they performed in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between the pony and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm pretty sure that Fentan's cute clothes helped her, she really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper "Renovation" will be the basis of the argument
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write fake news about the state-owned company.
The regulator said that the New Express now has to undergo a "complete reform."
The order of "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Zoomlion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was chaotic," the regulator said in a statement.
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter."
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, recommended the New Express to investigate those responsible for it, and the New Express's leadership team to be immediately revised."
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles in the New Express alleging financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen came on state television and admitted to writing and publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a homepage apology, saying it failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, a lot of high-profile suspects have admitted to TV-sharing defects.
Experts say that from time to time forceful confessions are made, despite a law in the latter part of this year prohibiting authorities from forcing a person to blame himself.

Bitta gave this information to the gathering after the Chief Spokespersons of the Hindu Justice Bench Pravin Dong and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma invited them to Hanuman Chalisa's lecture.
He lauded the efforts of the Shri Hindu Justice Bench to connect children with the Sanatan culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to impart worldly education to children, including religious education.
U.S.-Mexico drug mine finds its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the same length as six football pitches, connecting Tijuana, a warehouse near Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said it had already been shut down before a drug passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
The three men, about whom officials said they were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in jail and life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered since the Central Mexico marijuana crop, which enables drug mafia groups to challenge how quickly they deliver the product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found about 700 yards of track-equipped track stretching from a house in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat filed his nomination papers for the Assembly seat.
A total of seven candidates, including one and two independent candidates of the National People's Party (NPP), along with the BJP and the Congress, filed their nominations on Thursday.
On the seventh day of filing of nominations for the second phase of polling on November 19 after the Election Commission notification was issued, BJP candidate Rajsharan Bhagat submitted his nomination to the Returning Officer along with his founder Naresh Nanded.
Indian National Congress (INC) candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat along with his founder Ajay Kumar filed his nomination before the Returning Officer.
BJP candidate for 13-Kunkuri Assembly constituency Rohit Kumar Sai, independent candidate for his founder Mohanram and Kunkuri Assembly Dr Phulchand Kujur, along with his ten founders Smt. Apollina Khalkho, Sukdeo Nam Nampa, Ruben Kerketta, Sukhdev Jig, Hemant Kujur, Shaniram Bhag.
BJP candidate Shivshankar Pankra submitted his first nomination along with founder Tulsi Ram Kaushik and founder Rajendra Agarwal the second nomination.
The councillors accused Dukpa of coming to the ceremony without an invitation.
Dukpa said he has been invited by the food controller.
Aggrieved by the controversy, GTA members left the function.
Eight families were provided with food.
Mayor Amar Singh Rai, Deputy Mayor Suk Bahadur BK and other municipal councillors were present on the occasion.
British police send extradition notice to Assange
The British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for whom he would have to be present at the police station, as well as saying that he himself would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences, as well as his options under British law expired when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm fears he will be extradited to the U.S., asking the South American country for political asylum, requesting asylum at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had sent "a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange requiring him to be present at the police station on the date and time we chose."
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the issue of a police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face potential espionage charges.
A fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph with hot drinks between the legs
On the driver, a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) has been imposed for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by placing hot drinks between the legs.
Tiptree, Essex's 35-year-old Andrew Howie was spotted running his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink on their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrates Court, Howie has admitted the charge of negligent driving.
Seven points were added to his license, as a result of which he was banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Taxes on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status
The Department of Finance has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who had introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 Budget for housing valued at more than 2 million pounds, and for individuals who prefer to own a house in a company rather than an individual.
In tax year 2012/13, the stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which is already higher than the combined sum of North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties have a fair tax rate, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated council tax system.
"But this move may have silenced some foreign investors in buying properties in London and made them reluctant to sell to current owners," he added.
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market, extending from Fulham to Wimbledon, according to the price in the affluent south-west of London, has risen a record 11.8 per cent last year.
Central London's prices continued to rise by 5.6 per cent each year, but seemed to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market," according to Seville's research, as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) were witnessing a surge.
Scientists have highlighted further on the subject what is the relationship between the movements of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs tend to move their tail more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while restless dogs tend to move their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
"In humans, it's all well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions," said Georgia Velartigra, neuroscientist professor at the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that in dogs, like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral tail shaking by other dogs, the researchers tracked animals watching other dogs’ movies.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Vellartigra explained: “We introduced dogs with dogs’ movies – in the realistic version or in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues that confuse, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right.”
And when they saw that they were in the right place, they were in the wrong place, and they were in the wrong place.
But when they saw the tail shifting in direction, mainly turning to the left (again with a dog’s eye), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellratigara, he does not feel that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned this from their experience on what movements they should be concerned about and not on.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tail on one side it relates to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
The researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right portion is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he pointed out: “Unlike the Italian study – when the robot dog’s tail was moved to the left rather than the right, dogs were more likely to approach it rather than be restless.”
He said the difference was because dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in films.
He explained that the study of how dogs react to real dogs could help in this.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be obtained - and dogs in this case are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems likely that it will not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
A rock bank called Arctic Monkeys has postponed the gig in Glasgow after suffering from the constipation of its lead singer.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But the illness of his lead singer Alex Turner forced him to reschedul the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were obliged to postpone the gig in a similar manner at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight after seeking medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will have to postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro as well on Friday, November 1.
"The investigation found Alex Turner to have arthritis, and they are not sadly capable of performing."
The show will now take place at LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and the show will take place at Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience to all ticket holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service at the box office where you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
The Cardinals, the Catholic Church has the highest rank of clergymen, have a position just below the pope, and are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will represent the first group of his people, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it falls into the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held before the ceremony to promote the new cardinals, known as the pope-session.
"Pope Francis has decided to make his decision to hold a pope-council in February in advance, to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
In general, the Pope announces the number of cardinal electors less than 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals over the age of 80 at his will, he said.
Valero said next year's pope's meeting will be important as it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is some kind of prejudice towards Europe, especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, too, nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of South America has Roman Catholics, but their numbers are very low in the Cardinals.
The Cardinals Council - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose work is to find ways to improve the church - will also be the first cardinals to be elected after it has been formed.
Before that, the pope made all the decisions on his own.
"Just now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help himself," Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we’re not the first in this situation – it’s completely new.
Valero said that generally the Pope gives the post of cardinal to bishops of large places, but Francis was "completely going to be surprised - so we don't know whose names they will announce."
GM calls back pickup trucks in U.S. to correct seatback
According to a report by U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday, General Motors has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a shortage of hand-held seatbacks in its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sira pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a shortcoming in the front seat rotating system.
As a result of the seatback, the Union failed to comply with the Auto Safety Standards regarding the Head Restoration.
According to an information posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, "If the vehicle gets stuck behind, it is possible that the head restant may not be able to properly protect the driver, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began to be shipped in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, represents the most important wagon launch for the top U.S. automaker.
The GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The NSTMA could not review the notification letter due to a 16-day government shutdown that had hampered the growth in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year were up 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the stock of GM rose 1.4 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.
The disillusionment of Obama's voters
I voted for Obama twice for change.
He says Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's obstruction policy
Obamacare website's troubles, can't give an excuse for drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign recalls what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading some very sad books.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during my second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
It's called "The Courage to Win," and it's a commemoration of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I can relax at night and go to bed with my patients, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved unilateral, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of that time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A group of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82 percent approval rating when Obama became president in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh reality, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a tragic memory of lost opportunities.
It really changed after my first time voting.
To put it simply, I couldn’t imagine any of it.
I owe Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has stalled many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigrant reforms, public alternatives to healthcare, closing down bases on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times in which I have taken my stand for the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republican opposition policy is not a response to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary U.S. citizens nor can it respond to the prosecution of those exposing the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot explain the murder of Anwar El Awlaki, a US citizen without trial, nor the public funds and spending limits that fall during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media "have been the most aggressive ever since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, this cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into law by the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know if that was what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance could defy the political campaign that brought it forward.
Clearly, the elected office is not a predictable route, as opposition political parties and random events such as the Newtown Massacre will shape our public discussion.
Yet the many examples I have given above seem to be largely self-selected by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes that we’ve been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become much harder to return to 2008 through that book.
When I look back, I am reminded of their lost memories.
This week was reading a portion of the book, describing how Clinton did not suffer a huge loss because of Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
"I want my mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are that of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that PM Tony Abbott's interest in ancestral leave plan is a conflict of interest
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday scheme is a struggle because his daughters can get pregnant, and take advantage of it.
Maharathy of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the $6 million carbon tax bill payment, has claimed while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether carbon and mining taxes will be reduced.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have conflicts of interest, and that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"He may have an important interest conflict in the matter of the granted paternity leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after the fall again.
Mr. Palmer called for the restoration of the counting of votes to speed up the process.
Tony Autt's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after we vote?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which we can fill in our details on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6:30 pm.
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
That's because if a person doesn't like it, they can erase it.
In today's time, using a pencil seems completely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and taking his new work "very seriously."
Public office is for public service.
"We don't need any other award other than the award of history that we can serve the community at this critical time," he said.
As a result, the complainants had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anger over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
The fast-growing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that the criminals have gone unnoticed, he said.
They are not afraid of the police and the administration.
Referring to the recent incidents at different places, he said the safety of the common man can be easily assessed when the advocate society is not safe.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, receiving this information from two experts from the case, another sign that the global investigations by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market are moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, with $5.3 trillion in exchanges each day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the case appears to be a recurrence of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank had received a request for information from regulators this month.
"Our investigation in this case is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS had sent records of emails and instant messages received from the former trader to the UK regulator, Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from its current position of European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramachandani, head of European spot trading in the city, had gone on leave last week, while the former senior Currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts in the case said that Mr. Usher's instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after it was reported by the Swiss regulator, Finma, that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in many Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority Veco, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating bankers' allegations of misconduct in order to make their currency market fluctuations favorable.
Those familiar with the case said that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been closely examining instant messages and emails equivalent to years of searching for clues to any misconduct.
News about the probe has caused a stir among traders in the region, who have been among the leading individuals making the most profit in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as low volatility in the currency has reduced the opportunities for bookmakers.
Some bankers tried to suppress the issue by saying it was impossible to manipulate a very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks despite the extremely large scale of forex buying-selling means that "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced the removal of the trader from its Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London this week, a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe the trader acted alone, and has been controlled," said Credit Suisse.
Students studying other courses, including technical and management courses, will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice-Chancellor of the university has written to the Governor for permission to conduct elections.
As the admission process for the university started, the demand for holding of the students' union elections was raised.
He had also launched a signature campaign for the selection of his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
About two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, will be selected this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will have the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar said that permission has been sought from the Governor to conduct elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced soon.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college managements do not want a student union election on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity among students, elections cannot be held.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the elections.

After Diwali, the district administration will ask for permission to hold elections in colleges.
There is also a lack of clarity in the college's view on student union elections.
On Dhanteras, people have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from utensils in the capital.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30 per cent from the previous year
In Shimla, jewellery shops were crowded.
From the lower market to the malls, pottery shops were also seen crowded.
Although prices of such items have skyrocketed this year, people have still not shown any hesitation in making purchases on Shubh Muhurat.
On Friday, the auspicious time for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and 1:56 am to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
At the time of the said three muhurats, more crowd of people in suburbs including Shimla came in for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Bazaar, people did not find a place to stand.
The same thing happened in every small store.
In such a situation, shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as the Triodashi Dhanteras of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, is a sign of Shubh Deepawali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of the separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act, which requires citizens to buy or pay health insurance before the year 2014, that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while the other judges, Scalia, Thomas, Elito and Kennedy, disagreed.
The court also upheld the remaining 2,700 pages of the Act, saying that the condition of the Healthcare Act that states increase Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was moved by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NSOs) to block the legislation.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including projected nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that without money we cannot do our work.
Wealth is one of the greatest needs for life, but it is not in our interest to assume it all.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the auspicious occasion of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshipped by Kuber, the god of wealth and Yamaraj, the god of death.
Money plays an important role in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
We have a bad attitude towards money.
There is nothing more valuable than the wealth which has benefited humanity, but the wealth which has caused egoism has no meaning.
We should spend our money with a holy purpose and only with a holy purpose.
It is the duty of every individual to make money for the maintenance of the family.
Part of it must also be a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to accumulate uncounted wealth or to earn yen-can-type wealth destroys our conscience, our personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in the mind.
A portion of the money you give can also become the basis of someone’s life.
There are so many people in our society that we should all think about them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the lives of men.
All men desire wealth and success, and according to their malevolence, they also get wealth and success.
The same wealth is sustainable with respect.
No matter how rich a criminal may become, he cannot consume it properly or serve anyone else.
If you have money, don't bother with it.
The true wealth is the one who creates a way to flow into the hands of the innumerable.
There can be no better use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing is that money is not just money.
It was also in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Make sure you are the owner of this property.
A sub-inspector was killed and four others were critically injured in a collision between a truck and a police jeep in Agra this morning.
A speeding jeep of the Tajganj police station was rammed into a truck near the Tora police post in the early hours of this morning.
Four constables were critically injured in the accident, while Sub-Inspector Register Singh died on the spot.

The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed a day earlier that the PMT of 2012 was fake.
The STF has found fault with the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
Out of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
After the STF's disclosure, the Department of Medical Education has started brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to meet the list of all these suspected students with the STF.
A list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
The department officials said that since it has been a year since the students enrolled in 2012, it is necessary to seek legal advice in this regard.
The medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything as the matter is confined to the STF investigation.
Vyapam Director Tarun Pithore said if the STF submits the list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions will be cancelled immediately.
Dr Nirbhay Srivastava, Director of Medical Education, said that the students have not refused to cancel their admissions if they are found to be fake admissions.
According to STF officials, the fake students involved in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
Vyapam had revoked the eligibility of 345 suspected students in the PMT examination held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Department of Medical Education has cancelled 84 admissions so far.

If the new government continues its policy of stopping sale of kerosene through rations after the general elections, half a dozen states will not get kerosene at these shops.
The states where kerosene is to be sold are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, the sale of kerosene is also being stopped in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, a decision will be taken to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first is that electricity connections are being made in rural areas at a fast pace.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made elaborate preparations in this regard.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been stopped since October, 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been significantly reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh litres to one lakh litres.
Haryana's kerosene quota has been cut by about 40 per cent and Uttarakhand's 70 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there has been no report of shortage of kerosene from these states.
The ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene is being used for adulteration.
Currently, the price of PDS kerosene and diesel is Rs 37.
This encourages those who are addicted to it.
In states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Oil companies are currently losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore in 2013-14
The accused used to open investors' accounts and forgery in the name of buying and selling shares by citing a trading firm.
This is probably the first time that such a scam has been reported in the state.
The police have so far not been able to trace the gang leader but seven people, including the accused, have been detained by the police in the state.
The gang operated a fake commodity market named MetaTrader 5.
The company's agents used to take cash from investors and make fake IDs on a fake software.
This led to the arrest of the investors who had purchased the shares.
It was up to him to find out which share was purchased at what price.
In fact, no shares were bought and no transactions were made because no demat accounts were opened by the investors and the shares were falsely displayed on the fake software.
The police suspect that hundreds of people have come to the spot.
Each investor was given an investment of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the name of giving a profit.
While Amit Soni, the main accused in the case, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, six of his accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dupree, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company conduct share trading to its investors.
The investor's demat account is then opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but the company called MetaTrader 5 was neither associated with any exchange nor engaged in stock trading.
The company bought a server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been fooled in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight Indore-based merchants have come forward to lodge a complaint with the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their money was not transferred to the account.
In this regard, he started seeking profit from the company's shareholders.
Investors are even saying that the price of their purchased shares was always lower on the fake ID given to them.
This price was fixed by the accused at his own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents used to advise people to join this company by luring people to make more profits.
After that, he had to deposit Rs 5 lakh each.
On the day of the Test, the players of this team keep creating new records and now even in ODIs, their rutba is gradually increasing.
One of the best examples of this was seen on Thursday when a good-looking New Zealand team won the title after being crushed by Bangladesh to take an unassailable lead in the ODI series.
Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI of the three-match series to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win against New Zealand in ODIs.
Earlier, New Zealand had lost the series 0-4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's target of 248, New Zealand lost the wickets at regular intervals in front of Ghazi (34/3) and Mortaza (43/3), leading the team to 207 in 46.4 overs.
For New Zealand, Ross Taylor top-scored with 45 while Corey Anderson scored 37.
Kyle Mills scored an unbeaten 27 while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but none of the team's batsmen managed to convert a good start into a big innings which led to the team's loss.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite Tamim Iqbal's half-century.
Anderson and James Neesham scalped eight wickets each.
Anderson scalped four wickets for 40 runs while Neesham scalped four wickets for 53 runs.
Tamim became the highest run-scorer for Bangladesh in ODIs.
Tamim, who surpassed Shakib Al Hasan, has scored 3,702 runs in 124 matches.

The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is making crores of rupees a day at the Gate City Circle office building.
In such a situation, all employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
There is an atmosphere of fear amongst the staff working after cement falls from the roofs of this building.
The building, built in 1913 by the British, had the office of the first municipal corporation.
The building was handed over to the Electricity Board in 1995.
In the name of its repair, the department is doing a colourful dyeing.

NEW DELHI: BJP`s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday attacked the Congress at a poll rally in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital.
"""Sometimes there was a coalition government in many states and at the Centre, sometimes the Congress, sometimes the Communists, sometimes the BJP."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What the team did.
If there is a comparative result, then the country will not have the question of whether the BJP should come to power or not.
Wherever the BJP government is formed, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
The country is witnessing low inflation in the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had to eat twice.
But when the Congress or the government with its support was formed, the poor man was not fortunate to have enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even respond to the media.
The election belongs to the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
"""Today, questions are being asked to Modi, when the people will bless the BJP in 2014, he will present his work to the people every year,"" Modi said."
In a democracy, there should be no rulers in Delhi, there should be sevaks.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Friends of the Congress keep leaving the balloons on the day they arrive.
Friends of Congress, we have already given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people take the test.
A lawsuit has been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei in the case of a Nortle patent.
A group of thousands of former Nortel patentees has filed several patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it overtook in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The association, called Rockstar, which had bought Nortail patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The lawsuit said the patents also include technology that combines words searched on the Internet with words from consistent advertising, which is a key part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely contested by Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortle Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
"Despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suit in the auction, Google has violated, and continues to violate," the prosecution said.
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google as it claims that the violation of patents by Google is unwarranted.
Egypt's first president to be elected independently
Mohamed Morsi has taken his oath of office, but his victory day hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi, 16 months ago, promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first independently elected president to replace ousted Hosni Mubarak.
On its formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the first independently elected Islamic president of the Arab world, and the fifth president of Egypt after the removal of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath on his chair before 18 judges with black robes on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are aspiring for a better future, the new Egypt and the second Republic," Morsi said during a ceremonial ceremony shown in live broadcasts on national television.
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an unlawfully declared organization since its inception, and which has been targeted by previous governments, the 60-year-old Morsi, a U.S.-trained engineer of the party, said that "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building and came to Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, which was different from the president's pomp, and traffic was stopped for a while so that his motor convoy could leave the normally busy road that connects the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Morsi’s personal reputation as a non-Karishmai “empty tyre” of the Brotherhood rose sharply after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for the 2011 revolution against the dictatorial mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took the oath of office in front of judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber and said, "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
Morsi then moved to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
The military band played the national tune and was officially welcomed, while they stood in the pose of caution.
Field Marshal Husain Tantawi, the military ruler, was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there were welcomed with the slogan "The army and the people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as the fortress of secular education, the University of Cairo later became the fortress of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took the symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the site of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and took the oath to withdraw the presidential powers snatched from his position by the military council from the leader who was ousted last year.
But by customarily agreeing to take official oath before the court instead of taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases U.S. espionage has exceeded the limit.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.

"""I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process."
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to gain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill restricting surveillance activities by the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in the public that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The move was welcomed by six US companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also set up data centers in these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by four votes to 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapes under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, knowingly collecting and using unauthorized data would be considered a crime and would be punishable with imprisonment for ten years.
The bill will become law after both the Houses of Representatives and the Senate pass it.
"""The NSA's phone recording programme is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country,"" said Diane Festin, chairman and senator of the committee."
But more transparency has to be brought in.
Not only this, the privacy of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill.
In a letter to the senators, the companies said, We welcome the proposal of lawmakers to stop NSA from recording large-scale phone calls.
It is worth noting that the former CIA employee removed the veil from documents issued by Edward Snowden from the NSA's conduct.
The international community has been outraged after the NSA's telephonic monitoring of the talks between the heads of state of 35 countries, including Germany and France, was revealed.

The travel company expects its full-year underlying profit to be between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared to the previous forecast it reported between $305 million and $315 million.
If the target is achieved as per the current guidance, it will increase the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/12 by 12-17%.
Graham Turner, managing director, said the flight center has made a profit of 8 per cent in the first half, and has made a good start in its second half, especially in non-commercial travel to Australia and the UK.

Shares of the flight center rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
A recent media report said that the NSA used data from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post made the disclosure based on documents gathered from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named Muscular, which it ran in conjunction with its British counter Part-GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data from the giant fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013, saying that more than 18 crore documents were collected within three days of the start of the program.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
The program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunication provider helped the NSA gain access to the information, the Washington Post said.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for the NSA to operate outside the US, as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
NSA chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, this has never happened."
The NSA has always collected all the information within the ambit of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for espionage by the German Chancellor.

Schools devote more attention to maths, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least a play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporaneous British story after 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English Literature and Language course will be completed.
From 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of inspiration to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release new courses for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects in which revolutionary change will take place.
It will also change the next year in other major subjects.
In a separate step, the exam regulators will demonstrate the changes in the structure of GCSE with offical, new grading system, and less curriculum.
Speaking in the heat, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to improve our examination system to restore people's confidence," adding that "the GCSE will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies have found that English schools devote less time in mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours less per week during the session than in most countries.
Australian schools offer students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said broader math GCSE - combined with the subjects in the league table - was likely to encourage additional teaching to be provided in schools.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The apex court said it cannot tell the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said he was being called Dracula in the case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but they are not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many other treatments that can be used.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels that are particularly troubling him.
These people are damaging their image and reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Pawan Bansal, who is surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, put the opposition in a place where he said he had not seen a woman in 15 years.
After that, everyone was surprised to find out where the woman's story came from.
Perhaps Bansal's point was towards the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter on the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to get a complaint from a woman behind him during the last parliamentary elections, which was not successful.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had questioned him in connection with the railway bribery case.
If they had been made witnesses in the case, would they have been made only after the full investigation?
Bansal said he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam he was talking about.
If they are guilty of such a sin, they will be punished.
Though the Nigam was not the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the Opposition to speak up, he said.
He said as far as the development works are concerned, the opposition would be given a list of development works for 15 years.
The way Chandigarh is evolving or going to be, these people cannot even think there.
The two exchanged greetings at the Cabinet meeting.
At the conclusion of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for his response to the attack on Narendra Modi at Chintan camp.
He also said that there was no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be tackled.
The Chief Minister had the same feeling on his face that he took Singh’s speech in a positive way.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the Chintan camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be sacked from the cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, there is likely to be renewed consideration in the matter of putting the workers in government posts after the emergence of opinion in the Chintan camp.
State JD(U) president Vashishtha Narayan Singh had said that the appointment of workers in the 20-point committees would be announced soon.
They also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is learnt that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now inspect the list at his own level.
They will also check whether the opinion of the MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be extensively revamped to accommodate old and committed workers.
The MLAs and MPs have alleged that they were not consulted in making the list of nominations.
The names of those who came from other parties have been included in the list, while many important activists who have been active since the days of the Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One of such personalities also comes by the name of Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, a teacher at a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third of five siblings.
The five children of the family are Ramnikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to quit school only after high school.
Dhirubhai had started providing financial assistance to the house at a young age.
At this time, they used to set up shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he arrived in Aden, Yemen on a ship called Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramanikalal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no trouble getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to Watanabe.
In 1955, he tried to reach Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket.
And that's where their business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name was not only famous in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At that time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of the Sultanate.
Like his father, the names of these two brothers are also among the international businessmen.
Who doesn’t know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Killing mosquitoes is going to be expensive to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filaria.
The state government is going to triple the tax on repellents, mats, liquids used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal to increase the tax will be put before the cabinet soon.
The government, which is struggling with the financial crisis these days, is exploring all possible ways to increase earnings.
A resource committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister Mohammad Azam Khan to improve the financial health of the government.
According to sources, in the recent meeting of the resource committee, the committee rejected a number of proposals for tax enhancement, which would have a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given its nod to the proposal to increase tax on mosquito repellents, quails, mats and liquids.
It is proposed to triple the tax on them.
At present, there are four per cent VAT and one per cent additional tax on them.
Currently, it has an additional tax of 12.50 per cent and an additional tax of 1.50 per cent.
The government is expected to generate additional revenue of around Rs 14 crore.
To increase tax revenue, the Commerce Tax Department has been in favour of raising the tax on the Tendu leaf from 5 per cent to 14 per cent, but the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The committee believes that Tendu leaf is used to make beedi which people from the lower strata drink.
Similarly, the committee has not given the green light to increase the tax on transmission wire, etc. on electronic goods, saying it could have an impact on the general public.
The committee also rejected the proposal to impose a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: Police have reportedly removed the security cover of former minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security had been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hasan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the 2002 election on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was in his cabinet as Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said, "I have been wearing a security cover since 1996.
I live in a place called the Tower of Terror.
A CRPF security team was deployed at my house under the supervision of a sub-inspector.
I have bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Veerwar.
When the security team was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted by Kashmir IGP Abdul Gani Mir, he denied the information and said it was a sensitive matter.
I will personally examine how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been removed.
"""There is no such thing in my knowledge,"" state Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said."
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir in the next couple of days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Rather, contrary to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was prime minister, there came a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002)
Laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity at Kevadia in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Earlier there were no advertisements on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While records of DAVP show that UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements by Sardar Patel
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said the BJP's prime ministerial candidate does not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA did not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this happened due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is significantly less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tewari was asked about the difference, he said, It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the cost of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication to the people who oppose it trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in a rally in Patna on Sunday.
A week after the blast, security has been beefed up at all places in view of Narendra Modi's visit to Patna again.

Police will be looking into the persons who will attend the meetings.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will keep an eye on security.
Modi's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised over the BJP's 'Kalsh Yatra', which was carried out in Patna, where people were killed in the blast.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP is trying to destabilise the state.
Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Well is delivering free healthcare to rural areas of Cameroon
Welle and his team see hundreds of patients on almost every weekend.
West African countries don’t have too many doctors; there’s only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Please vote here or by mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Well is one of CNN's top 10 heroes in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in the other top 10 to make CNN the hero of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to the hospital in a state of alertness and fainting, which was not adequately facilitated to help him.
Jamel Well was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital, Yünde, in 1981.
Initially, he had only a broken arm, but an infection spread to his brain, and he produced hemorrhoids, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon," says Georges Well.
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well continued to surround his father with overcrowded clinics and hospitals and receive whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," Well said.
You leave home at 5 a.m. in the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait until they die.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Well's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If compared, there is one physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many of the residents of Cameroon will not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly two-thirds of healthcare spending in the country is from the private sector.
“Their only problem is poverty,” says Well.
And being poor, they can’t enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Well resolved to resolve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He also became a physician himself, and began working as a vascular surgeon at the Center Hospital in Uyonde.
And they launched the non-profit organization Escovium, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they sit in the van with up to 30 people, tie medical supplies to the roof, and move to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they actually get the honor of being heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations that the community can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is really a reason to celebrate, and the well – with its big smile and endless energy – is filled with joy and happiness.
The next morning, his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
“We’re meeting 500 people in each trip,” Well said.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people may get baggage, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in the school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out at the school building, town hall, or home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, making room for the next person.
The group’s generators light up the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work up early on Sunday mornings.
It's a waist-breaking momentum, but the village musicians generally help keep the crowd motivated.
"They've been playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work," Well said.
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, which includes Cameroon’s physicians and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that he will be able to go back to work due to receiving free hernia surgery.
The man said, "It will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in a hospital, Well also works in a private medical clinic around the Yonne at night.
He pointed out that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is done from private donations.
“I don’t know when they sleep,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Well’s group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity they will never get in their own country.
"We have been able to gain experimental experience in surgery that helps us catch tools for Dr. Well or clear blood stains," said O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S. you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students typically spend their own money to arrive in Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But once they reach the junction, they come and go, and pay well for the instructions.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling their promise to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
"I'm very happy when I do this job," says Well.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

"Congress has become so arrogant that it doesn't answer media questions."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment that he controls where he delivers his speeches and doesn't talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate it face-to-face.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014, we will submit a report to the people every year," Modi said.

Obama's health care proposal has been withdrawn.
Amidst the shower of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his often repeated misleading promise that “if you like your health plan, you can continue it.”
With millions receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that “a lot of people who have health insurance, and that’s useful, can continue it.”
Addressing what he calls a "news blow" about the cancellation, Obama has graced U.S. citizens who receive this information to buy new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much money or even a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaper than the proposed one.
"You'll get a better deal," he said.
It should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, you deserve better."
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market has been "unfortunate" since October.
"I'm just as disappointed and angry as everyone else," he said.
I want to gain your trust again.
Sebelius said this sentence in anger from a fellow sitting behind him at a House hearing yesterday after a sharp scuffle with the Republicans, which was caught by a mic. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily relinquished government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which it is now selling to millions of Americans.

As a result, there has been a decline in cases of violation of the Code of Conduct.
Since the election code of conduct came into force on October 4, 313 cases have been registered against various political parties till October 21.
As many as 31 cases were registered between October 22 and October 27.
With the enactment of the election code of conduct, cases of violations of the same had also started to come up.
There were a lot of complaints in the early days, but it was getting slower.
It is being told that in the early days, there were more complaints against political parties due to lack of complete knowledge about the code of conduct.
There are fewer complaints coming from the Election Commission due to the awareness of political parties and taking lessons from the case registered.
Many parties were campaigning like before due to lack of information, but when action was taken against them, they put a stop to it.
Political parties are following this with information about the election code of conduct.
It also reduces the number of violations.
A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government by the ADA, which is going to be sealed soon.
In this historic city surrounded by the Ganges-Yamuna on three sides, there is no such plot left on which the ADA can make a big residential plan.
In such a situation, he has now decided to plan housing from Jhunsi to the east, Fafamau to the north and Naini to the south.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of district magistrate Rajshekhar to give a comprehensive overview of the plan.
The ADA has come up with the idea of incorporating 200 revenue villages in Phulpur, Soraon and Karchhana.
The Chaka and Brave Block will come to an end once the ADA comes to the forefront.
At the same time, half of the area of the Kaurihar block will also be merged with the ADA.
According to ADA secretary Amarnath Upadhyay, a proposal has been sent to the government in this regard.
The ADA seeks to take the extent of these Gram Panchayats to its jurisdiction for planning, on which work will commence soon.
If this happens, the prices of the buildings in the city will come down.
Apart from this, the availability of housing will also be easy for the common people.
Soon, residential palaces will be erected in this new area on the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

Asaram, who is lodged in the Central Jail here under judicial custody for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl student, will be sent to a Diwali jail this time.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused in the rape case of a girl from Surat.
Meanwhile, his son Narayan Sai is running away from the police.
And that is why now an arrest warrant has also been issued against him by Gujarat Police.
It is also being reported from Ahmedabad that the trustees of Asaram have also started to lean towards Asaram gradually.
Apart from this, action is also being taken on the ashrams of Asaram, which are illegally or on government land.
We have already told you that Asaram owns more than 400 ashrams.
One of them is in New Jersey, USA.
Asaram and his son are facing various charges.
But even then, many of his heroes are not finished.
Asaram is not only in India but also in the US.
Here in India, Asaram may be in jail and devotees are getting away from him, but not in the US at all.
In New Jersey, devotees are still visiting the ashram as they have been visiting the ashram.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage has "improperly gone too far"
John Kerry has unwittingly indicated that the U.S.'s protective attitude to his surveillance program is softened by acknowledging that sometimes its espionage "improperly goes too far".
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty with Barack Obama of being on an "automatic pilot" in the form of insurrectionary disclosures towards informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.
This secretion has given the U.S. government diplomatic groundbreaking in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no question that the President, me, and others in the government were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because looking back, the difficult years of World War II, and the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11, had the potential.
He has become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has exceeded its limits, but has insisted that no one's rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has inappropriately gone too far."
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is currently conducting an in-depth review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was striving for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He further explained that: “We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, committed to killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We’ve actually saved the plane from crashing, building collapses, and killing people because we’ve been able to learn about other people’s plans in advance.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about the so-called U.S. espionage, and would try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of his involvement in counter-terrorism organisations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It's really important for U.S. national security interests that European countries be with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts," Murphy, the first-ever elected Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, told Washington.
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have brought bitterness in relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely true, and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden indicate that the NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of spying on allied countries and said it was normal for both sides to do so.
Amidst the uproar, Murphy said his office is organising a Congress visit, which is likely to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other lawmakers participating will be released in the coming days.
He said work is still being done on the yatra schedule.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that some "unpractical relationships" would have to be discarded.
European leaders will have to be honest with their people, as well as their spying programs used for years.
“Although we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, this weekend, Mr. Carrie is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address resentment about U.S. surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt, and Iran.
A new policy of board change has begun in the municipalities.
The Trinamool recently switched over to the Board of Councillors of the Congress-led Sanithia Municipality in Virbhum district.
The change came as most of the Congress councillors, including the chairman of the municipality, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress but some CPI(M), CPI(M) and the Forward Bloc councillors have also taken over the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy considers it a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Sanitiya Municipal Chairman Virender Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, had joined the Trinamool Congress.
Some of the TMC councillors, including the CPI(M), have also held the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the TMC and as per the numbers force, the Sanithia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the TMC.
Rai also claimed that all agreed with the development plan of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including Congress, CPI, CPI and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
Ahead of the November 22 elections, the Trinamool Congress is expected to take over the civic body following a change in the Congress councillors in the municipality.
Earlier, the Congress-ruled municipal boards in Haldia and Nadia were the example of the TMC taking over.
When the Trinamool is in control of the municipal board in the districts due to the change of party, those who join the party are given a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break up with other parties and join the leaders in the Trinamool.
He said those who broke away from any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
He claimed that the confidence of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI(M) says the lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated and threatened.
Fearing the terror of the Trinamool Congress, people are joining it.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen as a blow to democracy by the CPI(M).
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification for changing the vote in the matter of power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing the taxi driver of attacking her.
On June 15, the Phuket provincial court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false accusations against the Thai police, alleging that on Sunday morning a local taxi driver along with two other persons tried to stop him.
But CCTV footage later revealed that she had safely returned to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket admitted to fabricating the story after the police interrogated Bamfort for two days.
He was kept in the local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family is "extremely concerned" about taking care of their daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
"This has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope he will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamfod has appealed against the order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 baht.
Meanwhile, the report in Australia said that she was vacationing at Krabi's vacation spot in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to remain in adult prison.
However, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand could also seek impeachment in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
