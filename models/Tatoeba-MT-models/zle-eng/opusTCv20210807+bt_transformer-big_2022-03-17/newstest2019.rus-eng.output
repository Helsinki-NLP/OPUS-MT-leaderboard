Named the number of preparing to send to the Donbass recruits from Ukraine
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andriy Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to “at least somehow complete the units.”
“The reluctance of citizens of Ukraine to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing of units,” said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the joint forces operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure will lead to the strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DNR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian special services.
The US authorities forced Mask to leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of the Tesla company founded by him at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $ 20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain in a senior position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $ 20 million and leave the post of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It is specified that the agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mask of misleading shareholders with a statement about the availability of sufficient funds to buy back the shares of this company and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
We are talking about the publication of the businessman in Twitter, where he announced his desire to buy back Tesla shares at $420 apiece, but never did it.
After the tweet, the company's shares rose by almost 11%.
The head of the British foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the EU to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of enslaving member states.
The diplomat made this statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As noted by the Daily Mail, thus Hunt commented on the difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity,” the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only aggravate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that Brexit negotiations had come to a standstill.
She commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
It is expected that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom will take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The issue of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems in the Telegram messenger after the update, released on September 28.
The phone number of the user can be found by his username
The complaints concern gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Representatives of the messenger reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift language.
Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user upon receipt of the relevant court decision.
The audience of Telegram after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk settled their dispute over the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, within the framework of the reached agreements, Mask will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million.
A similar amount will be charged to Tesla.
The money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur, included in the list of the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX space corporation, the neurotech company Neuralink and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The price of $420 was allegedly set “because of the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana,” Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the co-director of the security department of the Commission Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way,” the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Mask, complaining about the financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs claimed that the posts of the businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman’s tweets were misleading, because of which sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy papers at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Also, other plaintiffs noted that the careless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Mask accused the head of the research company Citron Research of stock market fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face removal from the company’s management and even prison.
This, in particular, told CNBC the former chairman of the Commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is “a good guy who can’t run a car company.”

Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, head of the Department for External Church Relations (DOC) of the Moscow Patriarchate, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church schism and its political subtext
According to him, now, when “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage”, renaming the church is like in fascist Germany “Jews put on a yellow six-pointed star”.
"This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this purpose," a representative of the ROC said on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.”
The UOC called on the exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: sold-out, Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
About this Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said, summing up the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Grand Prix of Russia in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso and appreciated the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with automakers should be in the foreseeable future just the creation of the Russian car "Formula 1", which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I do not think that in such a time it is possible.
“I think it’s more realistic in the next 10 years.”
From 2012 to 2014 in Formula 1 under the Russian license was the team "Marusya".
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the Formula 1 World Championship.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sports, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let’s hope that such a team will appear.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, including because such infrastructure appeared in Sochi.
Tomorrow, Sochi Autodrom is waiting for a sell-out.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the stands were almost filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of the Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product, which will give even greater attractiveness to Sochi.
Not bypassed Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian fans of motorsport - the return of Daniel Kvyat in Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniil and wish him success in the next season," the deputy prime minister told Izvestia.
He is a very hopeful driver.
Next year, for the first time in the history of the peloton "Formula 1" will be able to take part in two major Russian pilots.
Although the fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the “Royal race” is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Grand Prix of Russia.
Let's hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

Shortly after winning the Nobel Prize in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, Parisian newspapers wrote: “For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions.”

By the way, in my opinion, this very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all about this.

US President Donald Trump noted a successful joke about his successes on the frontline of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have improved relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that the team of Barack Obama so launched relations with the DPRK that could not even call the country's leadership - there simply did not take off the phone.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “beautiful letters,” Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, “was cruel” to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders “fell in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, as well as closes military test sites.
All these are the merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.

At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Nice urged to oust the “Moscow language Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of his native language Larisa Nice called to oust from Ukraine "Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language."
To do this, she offers a Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
His thoughts on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" Nice shared with the Ukrainian edition of the Observer.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians “will recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier Russian language was widely used on television and radio, but there was practically no Russian language left in the public space.
At the same time, according to Nice, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only “the expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level.”
Earlier, she shared her experience in maintaining the “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a court with a network of Watsons bookstores, the cashier of one of which spoke to her in Russian.
Unable to achieve her, Nice threw a change at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians “language schizophrenia”, calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nice said that the name “Rus” was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
The writer’s anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she scandalized and left, slamming the door.
They had a conversation with a man, and it bore fruit.
Defender of “Ural” Denis Kulakov about the victory over “Arsenal” (2: 1) in the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.
"Dennis, what do you think made you win?"
"It seems to me that we wanted to win more," Kulakov said on the Ural's official website.
“Such a difficult game turned out, in the break we had a serious male conversation, and this bore fruit: we scored two goals and did not miss.
“You missed a few games because of the damage you sustained at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?”
“If it’s been 90 minutes, it’s okay.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe there's a little bit of power at the end to keep things from happening.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
“What about the atmosphere on the team?”
“It’s no secret that after victories and recovery is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans.”
"Did you miss the game while you weren't on the field?"
“There is such a thing, a little missed, because really, the unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting back on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

We urge citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of voting," the Interior Ministry spokesman said.
In a referendum on Sunday, citizens are asked one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum aims to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek province.
The foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which is the border between the two countries, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".

The accusation for the Dagestan deputy became news
The Soviet district court of Makhachkala detained for two months a deputy of the People’s Assembly of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, a suspect in participation in a criminal community that formalized a disability for bribes.
"Kommersant" became aware of the details of the investigation materials that shed light on how, according to the version of the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the operational-search activities conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
Earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other heads and employees of territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise under his authority, opened a criminal case under Art. 210 (creation of a criminal community with the use of official position and participation in it), Art. 290 (receiving a bribe by an organized group), Art. 292 (official forgery) and Art. 159 (fraud in a particularly large amount) of the Russian Federation.

The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestani officials, but for two months at a time, since Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appears in his case.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, the investigation has much more time to charge - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Alexander Vucic said that he does not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes can occur on the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make every effort in order to preserve peace, the newspaper reports.
We add that according to Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes “Tape.ru”.
A day earlier it became known that the Serbian President brought the army of the state in full combat readiness because of the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory adjacent to the lake that supplies water to the Gazivode hydroelectric power station.
It is specified that the specified hydroelectric power station is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time belongs to the Serbian power system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was almost absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we are almost accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more muted,” said the Senator in an interview published on Sunday “Russian newspaper”.
He explained that in previous years, Russia was sometimes “designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of the group of Western countries, which expressed itself quite unanimously on this matter.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's topic in a negative way was practically absent."
“If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not absolutely accurate,” said the politician, noting that Russia “no longer was a kind of wall, which is trained strikes with a tennis ball.”
The head of the profile committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, “will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three.”
“I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point,” Kosachev admitted, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia’s involvement manages to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," he added.
This is due to the fact that there is an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time.
“I don’t want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a movement backward, it will be a movement forward,” he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
“I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different,” he said.
According to him, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration.”
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus has declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the Minister of foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Muallem.
According to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawing militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case of the Kurds’ desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good, until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create by October 15 a demilitarized zone along the contact line of the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry leads Chelsea youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating the transition to Moscow “Spartak”.
As reported by RT with reference to Mirror, the former captain of England John Terry led the youth team of Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player who played for a long time in the London club, will lead the team is not older than 23 years.

First Vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for the “espionage” Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for the fact that he still could not be released from prison.
She said this in a video address to the political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, these days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris held an action, the participants of which declared a hunger protest demanding the release of prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, go hungry, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us “more evil, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil.”
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago, he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
“It was like I was hit with a hammer on the bottom of my skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
Put him in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon there, I couldn't stand it, I fell all the time.
They began to do tests, it turned out that things are bad, the artery does not allow blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, and they urgently performed an operation.
And during the operation, doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst,” Kikabidze said in the program “Once”.
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi residents even came to say goodbye to the idol at the door of his house.
But the wife of the actor did not allow to bury a living actor, she sincerely believed that she could cope with the disease and for more than a year did not depart from the bed of her beloved spouse.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there, like a rock,” the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time refutes the rumors about his illness, then about the untimely death, which now and then appear on the Web.
The creators of the website "Peacemaker" brought in the section "Purgation" of the Minister of foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Szijjarto.
The reason was “an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”
In addition, the Minister of foreign Affairs of the neighboring country was accused of “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as in participation in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violation of the legislation of Ukraine by citizens of Ukraine.
Note that before Siyarto in the "Purgatory" pleased the Viceroy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onufry.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian Local Church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Transcarpathia, the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the amount of the “golden parachute” of the Voronezh Deputy Governor
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On state positions".
At the same time, the real amount of the “golden parachute” released from the post of acting official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, Agibalov’s salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, the press service stressed, the amount of a lump sum amounted to minus income tax 223 892 rubles, not 1 million rubles, which was written by the media.
The official received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
His seniority in public office is more than nine years.
Appointment to him of this pension and lump sum payment is made immediately after dismissal from office, explained to the Agency “RIA Novosti” in the government of the region.
At the same time, Aguibalov’s payment of additional payments to the pension was suspended when appointed to the state position, and the amount of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
Alexander Gusev, the acting governor of the region who won the election, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was dismissed due to the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public positions in the region were terminated.
On September 29, the Telegram channel Nezygar published documents from which it followed that Agibalov, who resigned from the post of vice-governor, was paid a severance payment in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days after that he again received a similar position without the prefix "vrio".

Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents to masturbation provokes harmful information that they find on the Internet.
To combat this is at the level of educational institutions and family, added the Deputy.
Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow speaking":
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done, explaining the harm, because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the ability to officially enter into sexual contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by “hypocrisy”, the silence of “sexual age problems” and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are faced with masturbation.
The deputy believes that to practice lessons about the dangers of masturbation is primarily in schools of “hyperurbanized” regions.
“If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we simply will not be understood, to put it mildly,” he said.

AfG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to get seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country became a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most clearly evidenced by recent polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the rating of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it should be noted that the AdH created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall standings continues to be held by the ruling CSU/CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48% of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7% lower than last year.
We should add that the Social Democrats are followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s course, but at first only dealt with economic issues, including the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country's complete exit from the European Union.
Amid the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD’s political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the “Alternative for Germany” won seats in the European Parliament.
Published a video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine a “nation of fools”
Host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted live that he considers his compatriots “a nation of fools.”
They believe in television and don’t read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as much as 201 publications.

Canadians have created a car in the event of an apocalypse - the magazine behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions said it was already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Armored vehicle of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche is being mastered by car companies.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armored vehicle of the Apocalypse Senator APC.
In his spare time, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who without much comfort, but in complete safety are placed in an all-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or else the design can not be called, since the level of its reservation corresponds to the standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of armored vehicles of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that passengers are not harmed even by the blast wave from the projectile that exploded next to the car, the cabin of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For a safe view, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of circular vision cameras with night vision function, as well as an observation armored tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
The front of the car of the Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armored vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower endurance turbodiesel engine of 6.7 liters, the full power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of an armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There is no chance of getting stuck at all in the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
You can see the armored vehicle of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will be held in October.
The term of death of the universe
The universe will continue to exist for about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To such conclusions, experts came by observing with the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model of CDM (Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the accounting of data from the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: “Do you want the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, after which Russian citizens receive the right to an old-age pension, not to increase?”
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the most simple and legally capacious.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of “Fair Russia” Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (its wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who is friend and who is enemy.”

Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: "Admiral" has created us big problems
The head coach of "Ak Bars" Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the results of the match of the regular championship of the KHL against the "Admiral" (4: 2).
“It was a difficult game, a difficult one.
The enemy fought with dignity and caused us great problems.
I’m glad we played well in the majority.
I already said that once the goals will come, the main thing is that we work on it.
And that we won is also very important.”
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this particular series?"
“We have a program that he works on.
Therefore, there was such a decision,” the club’s press service quoted Bilyaletdinov as saying.

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbin's mistakes crumbled like from the horn of abundance
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness to referee the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of Spartak - Dynamo, neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI did not draw serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rude receptions were showered as if from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder fills with the help of his hands in his penalty area, Akhmat defender Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idov, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate game by the hand of the defender in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, sees the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three slept, and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was violated.
This was the case when judging by concepts supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown you the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams are fined for such violations, as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
It depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He wasn't given.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point is the double standards that the judge looks at, who is playing.
Here played on Saturday, “Locomotive” and “Akhmat” has serious claims to the work of Turbin, because the team was injured.
Matt Damon played accused of rape Judge Kavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of the program Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In the course of a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a hearing in the Senate on charges of rape.
A candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court earlier drew attention for his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but said that he had never been drunk until he was unconscious.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanaugh claimed that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that,” said Judge Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh was previously elected as the Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They're not alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old caton de tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be euthanized due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a dog of the Chihuahua breed named Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), who was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States thought about the naval blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
The United States may begin a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The US authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of energy.
About the possibility of a sea blockade the day before said the head of the U.S. interior Ministry Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior performs not police, but civilian functions, including implementing a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zink said that thanks to the naval forces, the United States controls the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be due to Washington’s desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke said.

There is a club in Russia that I follow.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0: 1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I’ve been watching recently and it was interesting to look at it from the side.
I can’t say I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again want to apologize for the decision,” said Terry.
Recall that “Rostov” with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and “Spartak” is located on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on October 7 on the road will play with "Yenisei", and the wards of Valery Karpin a day earlier will take "Orenburg".
The expensive violin was handed over to the pawnshop for a pittance
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawn shop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawn shop worker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that this is an old and expensive tool, and turned to an expert for advice.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to the pawnshop, but there are no previous collisions with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing a pawnshop violin will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: Spartak will take Rostov at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, not at all alien to the "people's team".
The peculiarity of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, lagging behind the far-flung Zenit and being one point away from Krasnodar, who tomorrow plays with Dynamo.
Red and white now has a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League team Massimo Carrera unexpectedly flew Rapid, and recently lost at home to Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak with a minimum score and not easily beat in the Chernomorets Cup, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia is closer to a way out of the crisis.
“Rostov” three matches in a row could not win, but the defeat does not know five matches.
We will see if Karpin will be able to extend the win-win series with such a principled match for himself.
Previous meeting Karpinsky “Rostov” with “Spartak” ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 19:00.

London has launched accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, said British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and enemies are operating in gray areas with cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians, Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, the former GRU Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of the UK, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia held a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum aims to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of renaming the republic to North Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring the preparations for the referendum and today's vote.
Jan Petersen, head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams have dispersed around the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then counting votes and compiling protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which oversaw the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgery: “About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions, and then describe them in the final report.
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
On September 30, International Translator’s Day, professional simultaneous interpreter Barbel Saxe told about this.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "long harness, but quickly go."
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role,” the expert said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, in order to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history."
And in the future, Saxe said, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to “get along” with Russia and support them.
According to her, the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin.

The comedy “Evening School”, which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $ 28 million for its first weekend at the box office.

In the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, collected $ 5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, significantly ahead of another newcomer to the Western hire - the cartoon "Smolfoot", a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project of directors Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig for his opening weekend raised $ 23 million, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted the film 20-25 million for the weekend.
As for the total fees of “Smolfoot”, at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (at the same time he made his debut in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the treasury of the film by 3.6 million.
The three strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "Mystery of the house with a clock" from the master of horrors Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director knows how to make high-quality movies for the audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellers’ book with the charming Jack Black with Cate Blanchett earned $ 12.5 million, bringing the total collection around the world to 53.8 million.

The last representative of the top five this week was the horror “Curse of the Nun”, which collected $ 5.4 million during the reporting period.
According to the results of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas, the spin-off has $330 million in total earnings and recently proudly holds the title of the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the “Conjuring” and two films about the terrible Annabelle doll.
Right after the horror film by Corin Hardy at the end of last weekend was another representative of the genre - debutant "Hellfest", one of the main youth horrors of the year.
In its first weekend, the brainchild of the famous editor (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including “Happy Death Day”, which “Hellfest” in some places is very similar, earned $ 5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was “Crazy Rich Asians” ($4.15 million), which, it seems, do not think to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy that has been living on the screens for the seventh week, according to the results of September is the sixth in the ranking of the highest-grossing tapes of the genre in history with an indicator of 165.7 million.

Among the other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical melodrama “A Star is Born”, the laureate of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama “Your Hate”.

Valery Belov: God helped "Siberia" today
The head coach of "Vityaz" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3: 4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"A colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to note our fans," Belov said on the official website of Vityaz.
“I hope they will also support, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, probably, the Lord helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro match 0: 3, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
But, nevertheless, I will take the blame on myself.
Because, apparently, something was missed in the preparation.
Compared to the last game, it was a different team.”
"It's ugly nepotism"
Viewers are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud."
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative in his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unreasonably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging of their close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutin had enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end to the first place,” reasoned Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program “Man from TV”.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin “leaked” beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of the Voice from Agutin's team - they were doomed".
“Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional.
“The contest has lost its meaning.”
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad in the project who does not sing but whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?",
“Like the way Dad sings, arrange a concert for him in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Close Relatives show.
"From Agutin's side, it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to ask your dad to perform on your own show, not on the show, which is done for the money of Channel 1."
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other member with real vocal credentials.
Why did the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merge, and Agutin’s father was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and off screens the same faces for decades!
Because you can't get through nepotism!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
It's all bullshit and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of the absurd continues!”
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional “Voice” on blind auditions came Gradsky’s son.
Then a meter and it did not occur to me to take my son to my own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

From tomorrow in Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction, reports the channel “Russia 24”.
The punishment threatens companies and officials if they do not transfer data on the house being built in time to the Unified Housing Information System.
The innovation will help those who decided to buy an apartment in a new building, but are afraid of the bankruptcy of the developer.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared construction, developers will have to fully credit the bank.
And many experts have already started talking about a possible strong rise in prices of apartments.
But as it turned out, not everyone agrees with this.
In the center of Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from the ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on the street of Ivan Kudri, said the Metropolitan police.
According to the victim, the unknown approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed a knife and demanded to give him money and a mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered to withdraw money from a bank card.
After the attacker received 4 thousand hryvnia and the phone, he hit the victim and fled,” the report says.
Law enforcement officers managed to detain the robber, they turned out to be a 25-year-old Kyiv man.
Now he faces up to seven years in prison.

The scientist spoke about the possible scientific program of the expedition of the Russian Federation to the moon
Head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible scientific research program for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is engaged in the development of areas of such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option is the placement of a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon, which would avoid interference caused by the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space sources of radio emission," Petrukovic added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of the Corporation “Roscosmos” said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation can carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
An offended customer threw a basket of feces in the store 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), what is called, “had a tooth” on the manager of a 24-hour store chain 7-Eleven: in May, he threw him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At half past midnight, he walked into the store and dumped the contents of the basket on the floor and on some of the goods located on the shelves.
In the basket were feces and urine, which Simms “borrowed” from a nearby mobile toilet.
Arriving at the scene, the police arrested the “avenger”.
He was jailed and released on $300 bail.
He was charged with illegal invasion of someone else's property and a criminal offense, and also forbidden to enter the store and approach the manager.
Although Simms' crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the court sentence can be quite harsh, as he has repeatedly violated the law: he is listed for large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and animal cruelty.

Sergey Sirotkin: I could not do anything, and it was very painful
Russian pilot "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race of the Grand Prix of Russia.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I found myself between two cars that immediately caught me.
I lost all the positions I had at the start, at the moment, right away.
I was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
I was hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get in the clean air, and we'd get the pace back, but we didn't have any rubber.
Plus I was fighting with a partner, he was also in contact.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most unbeaten track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Sirotkin told RIA Novosti.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race for the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was the British driver of Mercedes Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the basis of “Spartacus”
The President of the Russian tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of the players of the Moscow “Spartacus” Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko from training with the main team after the likes to criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports “Sport weekend”.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unworldly nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you want.
I wouldn't have reacted to it if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italians lack the flexibility to understand the situation.
And that doesn’t serve the team’s normal climate.
Today, Spartak does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartak has a lot of things that are not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction into the youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match,” Tarpishchev said.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Previously refused “Spartacus” John Terry led the youth team of “Chelsea”.
Students of "Sirius" discussed with scientists of nature-like technologies
Pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the website of the educational center reported on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist’s lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Students have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies will help, which young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal blessing.
This is an explosive growth of medical technologies, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is another side.
The development of nature-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a flip side - purposeful intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
Cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction, ”the scientist quotes REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-nature-like technologies of the Research Center "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Diakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online competition on information security "Cyber Challenge" will be sent to training in "Sirius".

Macedonia: Referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje on renaming the Balkan country “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historic province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic the opening of the path to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the agency EFE, only 34% of the turnout on Sunday’s plebiscite “did not reach” the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative in nature, perhaps the authorities in Skopje will decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if there were more “yes” votes cast, Macedonia would change its name despite the unreached quorum.

Kemerovo outraged herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, on the well-known Kemerovo page in the social network, a message appeared from an eyewitness that horned animals roam freely through one of the local cemeteries.
The animals walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory from weeds and thickets of grass, but some of the residents of the city did not like the behavior of animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for rams to do there.
Of sheep, of course, you can not say that they blaspheme, but still it is not a matter." (style preserved) - said the outraged Kemerovo.
Anyway, one of the witnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
To push and to push - how right?
There is no word for pressure.
That's right.
The word "press" in the sense of "to drag, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to satisfy".
We use this word in the belief that it comes from the word "pressure."
But “pressure” and “satisfaction” etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
To reach (church-book, outdated) means "enough, full, enough, enough for someone or something to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure are related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning of "do not depend on anything, have a self-sufficient meaning" - "to satisfy yourself."
Old Slavonic "to conquer" is related to the words "to reign" and "will".
To push, to suppress is completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "satisfaction", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]volt", which is also used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, that's the right thing to do.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press".
You can also use the "pressurize" design, but remember that it is a chancel.

A friendly man gave the baby an exclusive parking - the magazine behind the wheel
Miracles happen in our lives!
One of them was told on Twitter by German journalist Christy Dietz.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son parked his jogging bike (baby bike without pedals) near the same lamppost throughout the year.
And one morning, there was a cute sticker on the pole with a picture of a green bike and the inscription: "Only for him."
The excitement of mom and baby had no limit.
Christie thanked the anonymous well-wisher and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made many people smile.
The comments to it were also remarkable:
"How wonderful it is!"
"Thank you for the wonderful communication in this world."
"I think there are a lot of people in the world who are capable of such an act."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract the same attention as the antics of scoundrels."
“This is the world we need!”
Readers asked the journalist, if she still manages to find out who was the author of this idea, to tell about it.
After all, this man, apparently, is somewhere nearby: he has repeatedly watched how the baby parks, since this came to his mind.
Kvyat really deserves a place in Formula 1.

It will be interesting to watch his performances next year,” said Aleshin SMP Racing.

In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a state fee of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the Ural Meridian.
In mid-September, relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanova Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan Department of bailiffs, in which it was reported that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
Over the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former commander-in-chief of the Aerospace Forces, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of weapons from the air: the aerospace forces have made and continue to strike exactly at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, in three years tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria - for example, ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General staff of the Armed forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries.
And we are talking only about fixed persons, not including those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take up arms, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would flow to us."

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was targeted, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists”, as the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of the illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for reconciliation of the warring parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with prohibited phosphorus munitions.
The U.S. denied all the accusations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that is said by the Foreign Ministry," the president said.
As reported by “FACTS”, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin noted that the Consul of Hungary, who appears in the video with the distribution of Ukrainian Hungarian passports, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the Prosecutor’s office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing Hungarian passports.
The incident is qualified under the article "State treason".
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on flights of the Russian "board No. 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that at about 6 p.m. Tajik time on September 28 Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed north-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the transponder of the aircraft was turned off.
The direction of his flight suggests that the liner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the agency "Baikal24", the President in Abakan on the night of September 29 met personally the head of the region Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the true reason is “the problem of the second round.”
Next Sunday, the second round of elections of the head of the region should be held in Khakassia.
It went to Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin (“United Russia”).
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour with Konovalov should take part Andrey Filyagin ("Fair Russia").
Khakass media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin visited Khakassia in January.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to relax.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict, which has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, most notably neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, military operations are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing its reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by the terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and allocate funds for this purpose.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that first of all a political solution to the conflict must be found.
“Volkswagen” fully admitted his guilt in “dieselgate” in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
Losses of the concern are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June of next year, the automaker is required to buy or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said that the obligations have already been fulfilled in respect of 83% of cars, so that the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is trying hard to compensate for the losses and regain customer confidence.
Thus, the management of the concern has recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this is the right of the authorities received in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev’s decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
“It’s the same as in fascist Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to label the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this purpose,” the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it outlawed,” the priest believes.
“This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of draft laws No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The governor of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Viceroy of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the site of the monastery.
At different times in history, our predecessors and Christian relatives in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and protect their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something,” the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The governor of the Lavra also stressed that, probably, "your physical presence will be needed."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to kill, and therefore we will protect our shrine."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, you need to be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on about those who mislead the believers.
The UOC has a canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make dependent on the news Patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew of Rome.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has, ”said the viceroy of the Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?” said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, calling on believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other denominations have Tomos, whether they are independent from the Vatican.
The believers had to decide which temple to go to.
However, someone wants to sow discord and discord again.
Some get jealous that the domes are shining on the temples that they want to destroy,” the priest said.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it refers to the beginning of the XIII century.

He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we continue to play well, victories will come.

"It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal" - quotes Vorobyov's official website "Motorist".
“They tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
I didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent pressed us a little, we survived.
But the removal of us a little "fed".
The guys played well, performed the training installation.
I think if we continue to play well, the wins will come.
They did not score, they did not win with zero goals, but the content of the game was correct.
We will be lucky if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, the "Motorist" has increased compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“There was no foreign link.

Macedonian opposition leader refuses to vote in referendum
In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held on the issue of an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are invited to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE) Christian Mitskosky said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by the press Secretary of the party Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the contract, which he considers “delicious”.
According to the spokesman, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
“A new semi-sovereign state is being created with a new name,” Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes.
This treaty should resolve a long-standing dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje’s path to NATO and the EU.

The United States is satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” Patrushev said.
Afghanistan’s troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in Russia), which settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are now on Afghan soil.
And the peace of life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off militants for money - as long as they are not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% from the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% are for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they are growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be happy with that.
In 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the eponymous Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
Greece has a right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can’t make everyone happy.”
For the renaming of the country are the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the President of the country Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.
