India also reportedly hopes for a defense cooperation agreement between the two states.
FANO Russia will hold the final Expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editors of Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the Expert Session for the year and form a final list of indicators for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events on the formation of a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is being agreed.
At the end of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment,” said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert and analytical department of the FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars related, that is, arose from one cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and briefly you can find them on the university website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster can lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to simulate two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
Within a few million years, this object under the influence of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added label paints to the initial gas flows and found that due to rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud, a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to look for relatives stars in chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km / h in the area with a speed limit of 70 km / h and through the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbara.
A traffic police patrol in Karrat this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle after finding it was reaching 125 km/h when it left a service station on Batgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then turned to bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorbike and a man matching the driver's description were seen near the home on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Karrata Magistrates Court on September 23.
The motorbike was confiscated and detained for three months.
The school year in the DPR will begin no earlier than October

Investigation of the crash of TU-204 in Vnukovo in 2012 completed
The Investigative Committee of Russia completed the investigation of the criminal case on the crash of the TU-204 aircraft at Vnukovo airport in December 2012.
This was reported today in the SC of the Russian Federation.
"The Moscow Interregional Investigation Department on Transport of the Investigative Committee of Russia completed the investigation of the criminal case initiated on the fact of the crash of the TU-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline at Vnukovo airport on December 29, 2012, on the grounds of a crime under Part 3 of Article 263 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation / violation of the rules of safety of movement and operation of air transport, which caused the death of two or more persons by negligence," the ministry said.
The cause of the crash was the failure of the crew to comply with standard procedures and the increased speed of landing.
George Webster Accused of Rape at Hotels in Nairna and Pitlohry

George Webster, 28, faces charges during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlohry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
It is alleged that Webster attacked her when she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to consent".
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, which is located in the North Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not “clap the door” in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not slam the door on new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Minister of foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our retaliatory measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated.
And when we understand what European and American partners will enjoy this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to this.
This will not be due to slamming doors, some grievances, falsely understood, the minister stressed.
First of all, we will start from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners on their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are trying to achieve, the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say loudly that “they will be painful for us too, but we are forced to do this in order to punish Russia,” this is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively learn the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is a discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time apply anti-dumping measures against sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lilac in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since lilac loses its main attraction after flowering, it is advisable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
And next to lilac can and should be planted as plants, decorative at other times, and blooming at the same time with it.
Another advantage of lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a strained tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a semblance of a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved barrel.
Just choose the shape that is more in line with the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for selling fake money
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olonets and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezha.
In the course of the investigation, the guilt was proved for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with serving in a general regime colony.
The sentence did not come into legal force.
We will remind, last week convicted two sellers of counterfeit money, which they paid in stores Petrozavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy “Dervish”
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial meeting was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by sea,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Shipping Company.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and the cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the Victory Banner.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers to the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped shoes, tin, wool and many other tools and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships that took part in vital caravan operations, 126 transport and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects trade union organization as a civil law.
“Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs,” says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Progressive Faction Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Workers’ Empowerment Act along with Civil Rights Movement symbol John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
Amending the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participating in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and punitive payments - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to sort out what Allison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill suggest is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution drafted to ensure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions played a role in shaping a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, and to negotiate, and to act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at this purpose will be recognized as illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and to have that union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as well.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights — and the expansion of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against trade union organization — is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge temporarily blocks legislation that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the US, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginadle in June and was due to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
“Claims will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to obtain authority,” wrote in his decision, Judge John deGravels.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge will make a more permanent decision on this law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a string of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to gain hospital powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women are protected from an insidious law that seeks to deny them health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who did not act as plaintiffs in the case, and also applied for admission powers.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts have recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admissions laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one physician who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admissions authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission authority await a decision.
What will result from the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of retail chains should be Russian-made, said the Deputy of the state Duma from the faction “Fair Russia” Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at the introduction of protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper “Izvestia”.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. For the remaining groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers, "Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in retail chains is included in the package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Nalogovik", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
There will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will be mastered faster, and a contribution to GDP growth will be made.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, though not immediately,” the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into the shelves of local stores due to the high competition from foreign analogues.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been liberated and it is possible to breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks on the Russian market will receive food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, now is the moment of calm, when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in prices for finished products, ”said Tamara Kasyanova, First Vice President of the All-Russian Public Organization “Russian Club of Financial Directors”.
Definitely, the idea to sell at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper due to subsidies from another state.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots not in all articles.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to “reach” the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that low-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of products produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied,” the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in this scenario, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the second, as for a scarce product.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again discussed by economists in February this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products becomes even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers in the formation of orders to suppliers to take into account with domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently along the path of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," says deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also get a powerful impetus.
As you know, the largest share of imports remains for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still on Russian products,” Kasyanova says.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can speed up this process.
However, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, since this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that full import substitution will not happen, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is also necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide,” the expert states.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who say goodbye in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that those living in regions and remote areas of the state are 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
NEXT RESEARCH: New drugs may slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the women’s medical path over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside of cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of on-site services that will allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Neeve, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open in the Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaibelyak was started in April of this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of work amounted to a little more than 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
Here will provide medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the village of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Pyncherumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybelyak, Shinur and Chashayal.
The new medical and obstetric station will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will open soon.
Murdered four-month-old son in a drunken state Novocheboksarka will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of his own child.
In Cheboksary completed the investigation of the criminal case against 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation established that on July 26 of this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of the child of her godfather in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the Novocheboksarka decided to stay away and put the child to sleep.
When at night the baby woke up and cried, a drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the Investigative Committee for Chuvashia, was sent to court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper “Kommersant”, this week the MAYOR should make “small, but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in household income.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change, ”the source of the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the financial and economic bloc of the government regarding inflation and predict an increase in prices in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of product bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NST) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
Inflationary peak of 9% will occur in February, after which the annual growth rate of prices will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “accurate sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of AForex FC Analytical Department:
Price growth is already observed for the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch measures of systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures were to remain under control, the cost of a basket of the minimum set of products would not jump 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry risks of growth of the inflation component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the analytical department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also above the current level, another thing is that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, managing the assets of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector, this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually manifested in purchases of cash currency in order to protect their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and state regulation.
But the rise in prices begins traditionally after the summer lull and, perhaps, this autumn will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, since the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could cause horticultural centers to start losing tens of millions of pounds a year as today’s young consumers reach the “basic horticultural age,” according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent a house spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the house for parking, and the shrinking size of the garden as other factors posing a threat to the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be 5 billion euros.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the UK has the lowest spending rate on horticultural goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting a home and not having space for a garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said: “Plant growing in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of horticultural retailing as a result of the increase in homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass cleaning in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Fund “Agriculture” were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Fund “Agriculture” were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only about the dismissal of the Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who until then was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, the newspaper Trud reports.
I did not attend the board of fund managers because by law we are not members of the management, but I was informed later that I had been released.
I can’t say why my dismissal isn’t reported on the foundation’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday,” Angelova said.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of Investment Lending at the central fund in Zemledelia in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund "Agriculture" in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014, will be appointed in his place.
Only the deputy head of the fund, Atije Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat over spying report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification in connection with a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of this message by saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany’s main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence target drew a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's biggest companies join forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, instant messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($ 814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said.
The company is planned to be registered in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with a number of users of about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $ 8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $ 960 million.
Wanda also owns AMC Entertainment Holdings, making it the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, the development of which will be carried out by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce,” said Wang Jianlin, Wanda’s chief executive.
“There is no real O2O site in China right now, and in this situation, everyone’s chances are about equal,” he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the world’s largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huateng was China’s richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes from his share in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Li now ranks third among China’s richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda ranks fourth.
“Behind this battle is very interesting to watch: the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,” Cao Lei, director of China’s Hangzhou e-commerce research center, told Bloomberg.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation: “Rome can not be built in one day.”
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies, but also for the well-deserved leaders of the global e-commerce, is evidenced by the report on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter published on the eve.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period is almost two times higher than the same sum of competitors - it grew almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $ 1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has huge potential for money generation, largely due to its mobile apps,” said a report by an analyst at Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, which significantly exceeds the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
Road-show of the company, preceding this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $ 20 billion.
Until now, the record for the volume of funds raised on US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held an initial placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion on this.
At least half of food products in retail chains should be of Russian production, according to deputies of the state Duma.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Art. 8 of the Federal Law "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a “discount” will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products originating in Russia, the newspaper Izvestia reports.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was submitted to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvia municipality officials to the office of the state prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Calvia police chief on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Magalufé center of unbridled drunkenness.
Inspector General José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody as a result of allegations of corruption made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street on which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online edition of Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the anti-corruption prosecutor’s office in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism from the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
Our livelihoods cannot be compromised.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British vacationer giving a blowjob to 24 men during a bar race.
The authorities of the island since then are trying to stop hooliganism intoxicated among holidaymakers Magaluf, minimizing the number of notorious alcoholic races in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar race together were fined $55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcohol-intoxicated accidents involving a frenzied pastime known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
Spring has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell over the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 pm and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave out an early portion of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The squalid conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but fell into a wind shear zone — a sudden change in speed or wind direction over a short distance — and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two downpours.
Calculation of the cost of construction projects in the Russian Federation will occur in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes on special control.
The FAS has created an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the head of the Department of control of housing and communal services, construction and natural resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyov said that “today’s calculation of the estimates of construction sites is completely incomprehensible.”
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, according to the FAS.
And they propose to determine the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage on the basis of market prices of design solutions instead of the estimated norms used today and unit prices for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the roadmap and are now under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of traditional estimate documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyov explained to RGB.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury “whole tractors” in the documentation.
In Minstroy, FAS agrees.
"The first developments in the transition to the calculation of the cost of structural elements are already there: methods have been developed for calculating prices for design solutions, drawing up estimates for these indicators," said Elena Zhukova, head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told "RGB", the estimated standards have long been outdated, but the business has not yet been offered another mechanism.
“As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, in practice this is difficult to implement, since completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings,” he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely due to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of the NP "Expert community of professionals of state order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director for engineering at Rosatom’s industry capital construction center, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the contract portfolio, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximally protected from someone’s managerial influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a state order system in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case, it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff of the customer and budget expenditures for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, with this breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to a lack of interest in obtaining a state order for an incomplete volume of work and a small amount of the contract.
Deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Institute of procurement Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has turned into a business game for the attentiveness of the contractor.
And gave the following example: "the participant when filling out the application should indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "similar", "not lower", "lower", "higher", "may", "may", "earlier", "not earlier", "not higher", "not allowed".
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the “paper” proposal of the participant at the stage of application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of work, the implementation of which has not even begun, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when they are accepted.
At the expert council, it was also proposed to move the marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon, so that intermediate contractors disappear.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this is not worth it, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise it will turn out, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin’s “Atelier”: “Do you have a claim to the buttons?”
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went to school again on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and rain bombs rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory recovered from fighting.
The start of school has brought joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but traces of fighting have remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashos kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's slides before the arrival of students.
“We’re a little scared, but happy to look to the future,” said Ronit Barth, a Kibbutz resident and English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to start going to school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad had not taken to the streets or fled their homes, fleeing to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a piece of Palestinian landmine, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has tried hard from Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like children around the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to a popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic index for home prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase for June, July and August of 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne have a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney, house prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne - by 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged between five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was hit by government spending cuts, where prices rose just 1.4 percent year-on-year.
Mr Lawless said that now that the spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low-interest-rate environment, it is likely that home values will rise further over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokima and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Bolshaya Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century since the time of construction has not changed much, except for dilapidation.
Outsiders go here as a tour, and the residents suffer more than rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
An old courtyard, always an open door, a creaking staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls have cracked, and in the lumens of the plaster, in some places, the street is visible.
Everything seems to be based on an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
To live in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The object is on the state guard, but the money for its maintenance has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls still hold, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be happy in such conditions?
The road passes directly under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: a stream of cars is rushing under the windows.
You see, the glass rattles constantly, we can not open the windows, and we are used to the noise.
People get used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
We have two rooms, three of us with our son.
And for other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general, the ceilings are slightly more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: my husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila wraps her eyes around the room: entresoli, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them there is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very closely and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the water system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment as ordinary and amazing at the same time, like an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former closet.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
In the real estate center of Ufa, they say, privatization does not matter.
We still get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Already four months ago, they promised to resettle us, but the promises did not go further.
I’m not used to complaining and I won’t.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, my mother and father, my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, big rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are meter thick!
They say that the solution was mixed with eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
Maybe that’s why no one has been killed by a collapsed ceiling or pile.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
They say, and so it is - under our room a secret loophole and a passage to the White River, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that you could hide from danger, in case of what.
They were being chased.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them, begged them to let him start excavations in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give the living space in exchange for his one-man apartment on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where are we four in one?
And here, at least a tiny hope is that they will give housing more spacious.
If we agreed to the exchange, we would not have won anything.
The old man’s family won nothing.
The biggest dream of Lyudmila to be resettled, and the daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins in which two generations now live.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There in two small rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
Plaster falls off in pieces, like window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the faucet is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can see that the most fortunate couple Lavrentiev from apartment number 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room.
The room is 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks at the seams, falls apart, collapses.
The neighbors have already told us!
Most of the suffering we have with the floors: wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went from under our feet.
I've put up props, wedges; there's nothing in the hall yet, and in the other room we walk like swings, so shaky everything.
About the house of the merchant Evdokima Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
He treats the goldsmith like a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around stood wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean our house, but something prevented us from doing so.
History repeated itself in 2014: again lured by new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, bypassed the necessary authorities, and suddenly found out that the move to apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
I don’t believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the tenant.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a piece of paper without a signature and seal: “The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the tenants.”
I even got the feeling that our house is no longer in terms of the city, because at first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it is 57/1.
It's like it was already demolished in the '70s.
"Russian planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the Department of land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of settling dilapidated housing.
I can not be responsible for the actions of officials of the 70s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses along the street of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents will soon be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice will restore the Demidov House.
Now in Italy there is an architectural biennial, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Old Kazanskaya Street will be restored, the official said.
The houses will acquire the proper look, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to settle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye because of the storm began a forest fire
Dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting district forestry in the Pozharsky district of Primorsky Krai.
At the site of the fire there is an increase in the grouping of forces and means.
According to the management of KGSBU "Primorskaya airbase", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the air base:
The fire, which occurred in remote areas, was discovered by an observer pilot from the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood residue on an old burner.
The strong clutter of the territory and steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable for landing paratroopers and fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
Delivery of forces available at the air base by helicopter Mi-2 and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, 4 parachutists were promptly landed at the place of extinguishment.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional firefighting forces and means.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village of Okhotnych helicopter additionally delivered 3 paratroopers-firefighters.
As soon as the site for landing the helicopter in the fire area is ready, specialists will be moved to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the Primorsky Territory administration.

Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to make his way through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of kicking in cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was the kind of unsmiling guy in the corner who read the paper for most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now it's a little bit better, but it's dark, smoky, the depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father got into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to wash himself from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French allowed him to share the love that he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with French, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
He was the one that killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's change of career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-haired beard.
Ever since he gained critical acclaim for his Othello, he's been completely immersed in theatre.
A comedy of mistakes followed, followed by August Wilson's Fences.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and working in a factory.
DJ noticed how he parodied on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces".
His career in television began in the mid-seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black parodist / comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to "Black and White Minstrel Show", an easy entertainment program in which people "blackened their faces", Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I don’t want it to ever happen to me, but I don’t regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked at large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people."
Representing characters who both mocked and praised black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!.
Commercials, documentaries, television series, and film roles took him the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it feels like you're taking the time or you're turning away a little bit."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good about...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say I was really taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle-class people with pantyhose and cabbage down front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he got hooked.
I got the feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
“That’s what it is, it’s a serious matter, take it seriously, read your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it out.
And she was successful.
It seemed that they were waiting for a catastrophe, and it did not happen.
Soon we started a comedy of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to work 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer.'"
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You play in a play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Fences" at the Dachess Theatre
Learning the text for "Fences" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was well received, too, so it was like a sign from above showing, "That's what you need to do."
Of course, he says it in a loud voice.
So I stick to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mindset - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he starts, then ends to parody.
I just decided not to work at the stand-up because this thing with getting instant rewards from a complete stranger's room, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you try to do this all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at Apollo Live when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll give the stand-up tour any more.
The joy of sitting indoors with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the journey — I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify 'invisible workers'
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in state structures after he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (US$700,000) a month was lost due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebushi of the capital, Nairobi, said.
All government employees must report within the next two weeks to the identification centers to ensure their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, a government statement said.
Anyone who fails to do so without good reason will be struck off the payroll.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - hence putting an end to the problem of 'invisible workers,'" said Anne Vaiguru, secretary of the cabinet of ministers of planning and structuring power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies reported.
Police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption-detection activities last December, which were aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and tapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful world.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs
It is followed by a trail of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circles of the Tory Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson's parent company was taken by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are close to 1 million euros.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the BBC's management hierarchy itself, but also out as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs a complete radical reform.
But what kind of new president would risk coming by trampling and destroying an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty if he took his job out of the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people will be happy to see the BBC shrink in size - after a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow down and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of a license pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of 145.50 euros a year, the British acquire a stake in, definitely, the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its results cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
What’s more, it’s clear that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, up from 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and usage patterns have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found one.
Perry of Texas Says Humiliating Tweet Was Written by Someone Else
The tweet, from the confirmed account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night, contained an insulting image of the Democratic district attorney, who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the post was disavowed.
I just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
“I don’t approve of this tweet and I removed it,” a later post said.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the recordings were downloaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually engaged in publishing in this tape.
The earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet read: "I don't always drive while drunk, three times the legal blood alcohol level... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me so."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's office did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, saying the law, which is used to prosecute the governor who has been in office for the longest time in Texas history, is vague, which is against the constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state's Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is engaged in the prosecution of corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted an official complaint from a left-wing public-control group.
Perry's verified account tape is frequently updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at a party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumours that he might quit the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake and the words, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports real estate market back to 'normal'
One of London’s most prominent property developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital have been the subject of buoyant demand and skyrocketing prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to set limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the luxury construction company Berkeley, said Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013,” adding that it has provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market has been successful during the downturn, as foreign buyers have flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly surpassing the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable and student-led schemes rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching ?423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stopped by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "house tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons last week warned that April’s mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan conditions, would also result in lower market growth in both property deals and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its forecast for London property prices to 3 percent in 2015 on the basis that property prices were already starting to ease.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell a quarter from a year earlier in London’s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital proved to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than EUR 2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the term have remained."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April — almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual profit before taxes rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to 380 million euros, income - by 18 percent to 1.6 billion euros.
Speaking Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said Berkeley’s projected revenues for this year will meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, it is expected to profit for the whole year before taxes in the amount of 450 million euros.
The value of Berkeley shares was kept on the London Stock Exchange for the second half of the day.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Annual American Film Academy Awards.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims that he has a “catalogue” of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real, and condemned the hacker for “insolent intrusion into personal space.”
Law enforcement has been contacted, and they will pursue anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, allegedly came from a lack of Apple’s iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of the victims includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It’s unclear how many of those photos are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim vs. All star Winstead also tweeted a condemnation of the hack.
“To those who look at the photos we took with my husband a few years ago, being alone at home, I hope you are proud of yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of the series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria-winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of naked me FALSE, people.
Let me stop this in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande's spokesman denied that the photos in which, presumably, it is genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter “J”, which caused praise from critics
They dissolved, it is best to say so, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box, which was left in the rain.
Only sometimes the woman told him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed and, perhaps, a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this thornyness was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual to get rid of a lonely and boring life and, perhaps, even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with flabby hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and severe than the Port of Royben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a damp, but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were flowing, spiders were sitting motionless in the baths, slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds like giant cabbage mowers.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
The author’s view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is included in the long list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilinn sat holding hands, in broken sunbeds amid tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both disconnectedly connected to a cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long-forgotten black performer his father loved to listen to.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console no longer lost.
They weren’t banned — nothing was actually banned — they just didn’t lose anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word “archaic.”
Public taste did things that could never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich, who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, they chose ballads from all music.
Passionate about this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing the big legs of Eileenn.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father used to do to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forgetting to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t a lot of fun now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard it.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not explicitly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same with wit.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a wit expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent by temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the field of entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
Natives from India, as if by nature talented in everything that concerns electronics, took to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was doing plumbing work; what was left of the Greek was bilous plate.
Natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, in fear that they will be accused of inciting flames, in fear, in fact, that the flames will engulf them next, opened restaurants with labne and hookahs, did not stand out and then fell off.
Each according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileen was hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that looked like cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father have loved that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he did not want to press two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Keverna's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but a heap of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining at her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could alleviate the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, too, Keverne, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the deckchair, overturning the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Wine made of elderberry, so that intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
You don't, though.
He felt sorry for her because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her gaze when she gave him a rebuff.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not speak to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he did not doubt that in basic terms it was similar to here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same bewildered men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, than their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, roamed in fury from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand at any woman who dared to deny or tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First, they would kiss - the kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave is to kiss it first and then hit it.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons' corps showed him he needed to leave.
He got up from the sun lounger like an old man.
She herself felt the lead heaviness, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window watched him leave, her companion - a man who himself took on the burdens.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and the men in general, even though some of them raised their hands at her.
The man who turned his back on her, with his back bent, shamed, smitten, all ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single occasion, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or near the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Ofnau, the unofficial public mood control service, produced a small report on the persistence of low-to-medium levels of violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if not stop altogether, given the funds and forces that were allocated to its eradication.
"Much has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow settlements of the area where, despite the soaring spires of churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in all history.
However, some qualities appear to be ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it engenders.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of obstacles overcome and announces its fervent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness retain its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new and vicious acridity is emerging in homes, workplaces, on roads and even on the playground.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church, and what you call “evil” and “gross”, others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and vigor.
To continue to be bored with what happened if it actually happened, as if it happened, if at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the life force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
Behind his head, pink as flamingos, LED letters echoed the advice that Ofnau has been giving the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the word written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," Esme Nussbaum quietly replied when she made sure her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything other than that we haven't healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
What worries me is that if we’re not ready, we’ll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED.
Only this time we will throw away our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips in a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" the actions our grandfathers did or didn't do.
You go too far and when you talk about them throwing their "anger" and "distrust" at the "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we do not talk about “us” and “them”.
There was no “us” and there were no “others.”
It was a time of confusion - that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with myself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it is good or bad, what is done is done.
It was then.
There is no need to say anything else - here we agree.
And as you should not blame anyone, you should not justify yourself if it was appropriate or if you could fix something.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past exists so that we forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther Rabinowitz's pyramid collapsed.
"I'll review your report," he said, releasing it.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove to the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, "in vicious rage."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army says no coup planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army denied preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying it had acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying that the country's army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying that he received the threat of an assassination attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the army was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" whom police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police force that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to cause chaos,” he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moniel said the army's actions looked like a coup.
“While no one has claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of Lesotho’s armed forces so far appear to bear the hallmarks of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho Army officials said the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in Tabane's absence.
Thabane said he believed he was being attacked in an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his combined government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan in Milan, according to Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he took the field in the London club only three times.
Recall that earlier “Milan” rented Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Production in the Eurozone at the lowest level in 13 months
Eurozone production growth slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the Eurozone manufacturing sector for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for the bank to have a clear plan for how to deal with the eurozone’s recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi could give additional signals later this week that he is mulling a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and US during the financial crisis.
“While some growth is better than none at all, the drag on producers from growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s senior economist.
PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s biggest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
“Indications that the growth momentum has waned mainly in the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also don’t add confidence,” Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the eurozone manufacturing sector’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Euro zone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions — especially those related to Russia/Ukraine — add to the uncertainties of still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence, and likely leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was "increasingly like" that the ECB would eventually have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupol will put up a living chain against the militia
In Mariupol, until last week, everything was calm - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are looking forward to the arrival of the “militia”.
According to political scientists, the separatists break through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics, was recently taken.
The Mariupol people decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but it has a little bit against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and they were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a human chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They will do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closing, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible seizure of the school, how the children who found themselves in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the terrible takeover of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children who heroically survived the disaster, warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like something of an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united East and West in disgust, which miraculously then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the school massacre.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, although memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now afflicting Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now stop.
The girl who in the photo is trying to get back into the shooting gym
It is captured in the picture of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear he tried to climb back into the fired sports hall after the explosion of a mine.
In confusion, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and crawled back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There are a few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Zera Gapoeva was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little and we wanted to go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I graduate and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet of me climbing through a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, find out about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing that his mother is dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way saw a crying baby, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now the defunct newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as the Children's Advocate from Barnardo's Foundation by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
I can tell you that it is fading in my mind.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they are dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and ride in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered at the convent last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police force someday and hope to be enrolled in a training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the eerie silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I would love to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
It’s only been a month since my nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't gotten better in 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch turning away from us for hours.
I couldn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for hours I was so sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got back on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember yelling at him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: George Ilyin survived Beslan with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and George today on the right
His bloodstained face had a stamp of fear as he fled from death as Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on his first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
Goes into the soul: the photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember George so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the weeping George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now: “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is headed for something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to go by to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had nightmares about capture, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won’t forget it, but I don’t feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'll study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be in the military, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We think it was yesterday,” says George, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer at the FSB but was unable to because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events - I must say that this is not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the following year - was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with a laptop-open photograph of himself in hospital after being captured
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they’ve never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with my knee, which has been damaged, but now I am walking normally.
But still health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about my experience.
This is not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him, it has to be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan the imprint lies on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several operations, he can walk, but can not play sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We've been one friendly country in the past, how come we're at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far away as you can get.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
A child who was taken to a safe place by a special forces soldier
Rescued: Alena Tskaeva carries a Russian special forces fighter to safety (left).
Now she is ten (right), and she does not remember about the monstrous crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was taken from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the sports hall of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alyonina's mother and sister died in a deadly carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a small daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, say neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both wonderful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to being able to re-enter the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play for Borussia again,” Kagawa said.
I feel really good.
I am full of positive emotions and I am looking forward to getting back on the field in the form of Borussia.
Kagawa moved to United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to gain a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the championship of England in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man charged with hitting girl at pedestrian crossing “pelican” in Fife
78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at a pedestrian crossing “Pelican” in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl on the crossing in Pittenwyn in East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied his guilt at Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be sold in Vladivostok
Duty Free store Vladivostok airport posted a sign prohibiting to make purchases in this store to a number of world political leaders.
Don't give them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The administration of the store decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous comrades will not be able to buy vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance in an even less accessible institution by his kind of service - the Diet canteens of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the conditions of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheese varieties in demand among buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the enterprise "Yugptyceprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also gave advice to restaurateurs to reorient to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia on August 7.
Head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of purposeful preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their own level, Maslakov said.
The third place is a confirmation of our rather high command level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
Please note that we did not prepare for this competition.
The season is over, and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the national team.
The French, on the contrary, put up a capable team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were an order of magnitude lower than in the same Diamond League.
Season's over.
Naturally, the result is not so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the absurd, when at 1500 m men were so fond of tactical intricacies of running that they showed the result below the average level ... women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or shoot videos underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof “soap”, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $ 300.
I took these pictures at a family celebration with a few cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you’ll be shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others are 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not work.
"Soaps" have LCDs that will help you compose pictures, while action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see under water, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So do a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that takes a few shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay near the surface when you’re shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Come closer to the shooting objects.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling Bilal Makhov can go into Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the Dagestan national freestyle wrestling team Sazhidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is at the gathering of the team of "classics", - Sazhid Sazhidov quotes "R-Sport".
In general, Bilal performed in both styles for juniors.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third prize-winner in Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has long been talk that our heavyweight will spend a new stage of his career in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Makhov can perform already at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins a fake.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could shake everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving patients from both the suffering of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment are mostly concerned about something completely different — pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
While struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself irritably blaming his wife, Juliet.
“I want things to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle,” but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when a recommendatory industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe-insulators, builders, carpenters, and dockworkers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems a cause for concern today.
But that calm is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death toll of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected number of future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma development usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, wealth level, profession or age.
The bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, have proven to be no salvation.
The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe-insulator.
As a matter of fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors and loaders used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have interned at Guy's Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one left alive."
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to lead expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK has to go away, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had inadvertently exposed Janice Ellen to asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
"Before it happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
As a matter of fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word “asbestiform,” which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe thermal insulation, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there is strong, albeit circumstantial, reason to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito’s work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study that suggests "a substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Much of this impact, he says, is due to “the normal use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been exposed unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be driven by something as innocuous as "strong air currents."
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the House Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean sanitary certificate", it now recognized that work needed to be done on the ? 1 billion renovation of Parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might be sitting in the QE2 conference center nearby, rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules."
It is impossible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who never managed to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that had successfully been sued for asbestos,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s hard to remember all the places you worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly I started to get sick.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain came from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he could not go to work for a month.
Puzzled doctors took x-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was exercising and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to his office with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just move on,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott dived into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings now get sick with this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, in theory, saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren set their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
It’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
schools as well.
In fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos in class for the first time.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, students set their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have emerged that highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, innocuous things like floor tiles or barn roofs tended to contain asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Be careful with garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes a long time to realize it,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to have Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers being baffled by the amount of information that had to be taken.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life — the very act of breathing — that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from inhalation of asbestos needle fibers," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed while interning at the hospital.
When the asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Tregere says, “breathing pushes them to the periphery, where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes heated disputes.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The coach disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut out the pleura," he says.
You can't go around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "acts" but does not cure.
“From time to time there are patients who live a long time,” says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after being diagnosed, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after being diagnosed, single-handedly turned into a support and counseling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "managed to give everything a slightly more positive coloring."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need direction, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to be directed and approved for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
Then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that they talked about the bad faith of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but this was not a "full-cost settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson was unable to conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy’s Hospital confirmed, however, that “asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
As a matter of fact, linking lethal asbestos contact to one company or place of work — usually decades after that — has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed.
Insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that time is on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, serious new legislation came out this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
According to this law, a fund of ?350 million was created, financed by the insurance industry, for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a regular compensation case - about ? 120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma sufferers, believes that the $350 million represents a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time gap had not intervened and mesothelioma patients would have been able to track companies and file a lawsuit the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, previously the Secretary of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law is “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die each day, quick action was necessary.
"People are suffering so badly and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunsky boasts a whopping 40 percent of surviving patients in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is a power that sustains you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March [2014].
There were a few spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about what you need to show your wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become sad.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn’t live to see old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now invented a canvas that does not ignite.
I saw napkins made of it, smoldering in the fireplaces at the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is an ideal heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
Prudential statistics reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that the asbestos particles in her lungs "were, without a doubt, the main cause of death."

No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos, was intensively developed.
Voluntary Industrial Ban on Imports of Blue Asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for harm to health caused by exposure to asbestos in the UK.
Global production of asbestos is growing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Health and Industrial Safety Executive Committee in the UK requires all contractors working with asbestos to obtain a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the UK.
The compensation scheme in the amount of 350 million euros has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China’s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
The move is likely to kick off long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision by the National People’s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't disappoint our expectations, but it still makes us furious," said lawmaker Emily Lau, the Democratic Party's chairman.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They tricked the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, said it would be too “chaotic” to allow a popular run for Hong Kong’s presidency.
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to vote for the head of government starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward because it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominating commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when one of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years took place.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to inform you that all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Public authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and security measures involving police and barricades have been stepped up at government headquarters on Sunday.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put Hong Kong’s business at risk.
“The protest they’re talking about could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” said Rep. Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is a perception that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state-run media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists have been shown saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
American culture of proms comes to university life: freshmen were invited to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that while students need to pay a tuition fee of 9,000 euros a year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as disconnected from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSC Vice President of Higher Education, said: “This project appears to be incredibly disconnected from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with soaring spending on basic needs, before they can even start thinking about taking out thousands of pounds on something like a simple dormitory arrival.
Feminists raise questions about race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
They raise their hands, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” as they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and attracted nationwide attention, Perez saw responses from white women that focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the Aug. 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as "Thinking of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism isn't just about oppressing women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privilege at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For Korita, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson laid bare the problems black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “women’s problems” in the cultural field.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about people of color being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hatteri, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the rape of a white woman was almost always the basis,” Hatteri said.
It took a white woman confirming the story to justify the lynching.
From Hatteri's perspective, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to put all the eggs in the voting basket for women, and voting rights for blacks should come later,” Hatteri said.
A look back at such things gives us a clear idea of why women of color don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of lynchings.
This group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In Mitchell’s view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson — police behavior, racial discrimination — reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch up” with problems that black women have coped with in several generations.
"Would it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what it means.
A prominent white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, took to Facebook two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown and published a scathing article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans participate more in protests about racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason for understanding the dangers of the body — and the perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys — will be at the forefront of change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem vouchs for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments about race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she voiced earlier.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “My Brother’s Watch” to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only issue pushing the forefront of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again — this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present the issue as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories resonate with women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with a pig" for sale
A photo of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
Up for sale for $120,000, a single bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was posted in error and has already been deleted," a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique single-bedroom house".
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round of the US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, Vasily Osipov reports from New York.
How would you rate your performance at this year’s Grand Slams?
Of course, I’m glad that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially in the endings of some matches.
Of course I'm upset now.
I couldn’t even get to the quarterfinals.
What tasks do you set for yourself before the end of the season?
After a disappointing defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I’m going to do my best to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed for the implementation of the norms of the TRP to give bonuses when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pulling, running and other exercises.
We will remind, 12 subjects of Russia will begin to introduce from September 1 on their territory the norms of the TRP.
I also offered students who passed the GTO, to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuev.
For example, they can add a little points to the EGG.
There are also proposals to give an additional day off to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A player in the Harvey lottery this month.
There is a search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $ 1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday evening.
A newsstand in Harvey earns gold in the main prize draw for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the grand prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, following the huge $7.5 million win of a couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and reported that the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire brings the number of top prize winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total win of $85 million.
The Ministry of economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the market of electric vehicles
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas engine fuel in Russia already has.
The plan (a copy of Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of concessional lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals for reducing the price of cars, stimulating localization and creating a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (at parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities in 2015 that they also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with an advantage when driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric vehicles in Russia is still being formed - in 2013 about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts Andrey Pankov, chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia.
But a five-fold increase does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors has imported electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remiz, director of strategic planning and partnerships at Renault in Russia.
Most other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
Developments of electric vehicles have Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is negligible.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to "ASM-holding", "AvtoVAZ" produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the Director of "AVTOVAZ" in engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support for a breakthrough in this segment will not.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (gas stations - units), sighs the General Director of "Autostat" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of Avtorev Mikhail Podorozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that “electric mobility” is real; in particular, the emergence of new charging stations will contribute to this, says Wolfgang Schlimme, President of the BMW Group in Russia.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are also underway with other regions.
According to the director of the Rosseti department, Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build refueling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, "Rosseti" as a grid company is not entitled to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do so in relation to charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia to zero customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being considered.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is discussed and concerns all cars) will also support the market, but not as much as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, in Norway, where the tax cut led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as has already been done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along dedicated lanes, which is not yet possible in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
One-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are being identified.
In the Donetsk region deal with captured militants of the battalion “Donbass”.
The coaches were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in southeastern Ukraine was really like, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the battalion "Donbass" remained alive after the "meat grinder", in which they fell near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, virtually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters was informed that it was possible to exit the “ring” along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But in just a couple of minutes, shells and bullets were heard from all sides.
“According to the information that I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave,” says the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign “Lermontov”.
And when we went down in the lowlands between Multipol and Chervonoselsky, cross-fire began with anti-tank guided missiles, with “ears”, 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
In front of me were four cars and behind three, in the end there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call sign “Lermontov” says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
In the battalion “Donbass”, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly repaired in the South-East “separatists”.
Alex has already seen a different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there is a mortar attack, that most likely it is the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said that we were in a ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from Zurahovo to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the “boiler” near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if it were possible to turn back time, they would never join the punitive battalion.
All prisoners of the militia handed over to the security forces of the DNR.
Everyone is being investigated for war crimes.
A headquarters has been set up in the region to limit food prices
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of prices for products in the region's market.
A decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev “Rosneft” will compensate for $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lysychansk refinery in Ukraine at $ 140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichansk refinery was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no battles, there were no 'fostering rebels', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, lost technological oil pumped into the pipes,” he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery, an oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansk Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 standard fuel, as well as Euro-5 standard diesel fuel batches.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its loss-making.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk refinery, along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, it happened around 10:30 am local time from Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
As told to Interfax in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.

The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued its rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
Continued to get cheaper and the ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already playing back the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia in advance.
However, so far it is more like an artificial hysteria inflated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not so many options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
Geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be sued with "Ideal-tour"
"Orenburg airlines" filed "Ideal-tour" claims for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, which will be held in October.

Twitter tries to be more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the process of registering users in order to quickly involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandoned their microblogs.
Now new Twitter users will view a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration to immediately make up their reading circle.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
In this case, Twitter automatically sets a check mark for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove ticks in order not to read those who are not interested in him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the popular blogger’s tweets to help make an impression about a person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on the modernization of the service.
Such activity is primarily associated with the continued attempts of the service to achieve break-even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company at the moment desperately needs more loyal resource of consumers who, once entered, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, according to meteorologists.

The program of car recycling resumed from September 1
From September 1, the program for car recycling is resumed in Russia.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will cover all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Earlier in Russia there was a similar program of car recycling.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is expected not only to dispose of cars to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the opportunity, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one at a discount when renting the old one to a "trade-in" from a dealer.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is widely known only now.
The game was inspired by the Ferguson protests, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population occur.
The hero can take different photos of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters - bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where an ordinary person can not go.
If he covers events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
Points in the game will need to be typed using the hero’s Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there turn out to be popular.
The game has no title yet.
The release date and platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, has published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photo of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media cover the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletey draws Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of defense of Ukraine Valery Heletey draws the people in the continuation of the bloody confrontation, said in a statement the Russian foreign Ministry.
“Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who said about the “completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, the losses of which will be counted “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page the mentioned post, is a subject for study by specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that the "operation to liberate eastern Ukraine" was completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate pictures of the stars and apologized
Today, horror has swept more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers cracked primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate pictures appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.

And now I will remove the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice,” the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already spread across the network.

Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended little more than midway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall a second time after his right front tire ruptured on lap 172, putting an end to his performance.
Stewart took his battered car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
Head of his team Chad Johnston said that 14 team members are upset, but will now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart first hit the wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after colliding with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty big hope of making it to the finish line," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded on a tow truck, and the team got together and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a dirt track race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and he needed to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the track to express dissatisfaction with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision was made as to whether Stewart would be charged.
The three-time champion was met with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting in 12th position, Stewart went into the first 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after restarting Bush's number.
The car 18 went off track at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell behind to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with cigarettes Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not fail to report on her Instagram.
However, one photo was very surprising and very embarrassed the fans of the couple.
The photo was taken by Zhvanetsky.
"At the breakfast of Mikhail Mikhalych Zhvanetsky, Maxim explains what an instagram is:))" - signed a photo of Ksenia Sobchak.
There is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, buns, butter or anything.
Fans of the couple decided that Ksenia also smokes, and condemned her for it.
“And whose cigarettes?, “Smoking kills!”, “What kind of cigarette breakfast)”, “Like at breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes))), “Ksenia, you also smoke?” — excited for his favorite subscribers of her blog.
We will remind, recently Sobchak boasted what a delicious dinner for the first time in her life prepared by Maxim Vitorgan.
“Happiness is when you come to the country, and your husband prepared dinner for your arrival (for the first time in a married life, but how delicious.The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he did not say words from an anecdote: “so that now every day was like this,” boasted his husband Ksenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxim is preparing something with diligence, and salty and baked chicken are already served on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials hold national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the country's capital, Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to return the previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The increase in salaries is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the interim Minister of justice Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the trade union of prison employees repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, an agreement was not reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations continue, the head of the Main Department for the Execution of Sentences Rosen Zhelyazkov told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the prison union.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayut (right) appointed Pravit Wongsuwan as Defence Minister (left)
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-o-cha, has announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of the posts are held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
Prayuth Chan-o-cha was formally confirmed as prime minister on Monday after the Thai king formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old, who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the premiership.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army has previously appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Officially, Prayut Chan-o-cha will be interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
against the background of complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglik Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army ousted Yinglik's brother Shinawath Thaksin as prime minister.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the metropolitan elite entered the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the salad mussels will be better, I did not promise you this, joked the waitress from the new brasserie Palm.
We have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "mussels" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurateurs like to say that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that are not so good, but even great, but some bad luck.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-Mama", and also the restaurant "Bojole" and the beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, and Belgian.
Above the ground there is only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, like in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - TVs where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have long been not new, so there is something to compare.
There are eight types of bottled beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottled (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "midiums are hearty big seeds", and it should be noted that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that a meatloaf with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio, sliced besides so thin that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly matter thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you warm up half a plate together.
The salads are even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would most correctly be considered a crime against the Belgian people: some rotten iceberg, boiled potatoes once upon a time, a sprawling Kenyan beans, wooden bacon chips plus pickled onions for some reason.
With a salad like that, you don't want to meet anyone!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes to immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked mushrooms, then why do mussels look like they have been defrosted and boiled several times in their lives!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pans "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not get it.
There are vegetables, and there is no aroma, and whether there was wine there remained a mystery.
But good relying on mussels frits with home mayonnaise.
Chicken waterfowl here is not a stew, thick to the point that depending on the mood you can decide whether the first or second dish is in front of you, but just a pleasant creamy soup.
It was stated that a local cook cooked the rabbit in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary drowned out everything.
It seemed that this rabbit was fed exclusively rosemary bushes during his life, which caused the meat to acquire such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust was attached to the rabbit's leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce was too watery, and wafers are dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in lunch impressions.
So we should come back.
The dollar rose on the MICEX above 37 rubles on the news about the upcoming new Western sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
Dollar calculations “tomorrow” to 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow stock exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, and paired with the euro, and paired with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says Anna Bodrova, senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news, yesterday was crossed out.
The week, according to forecasts of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in one chain.
The acceleration of inflation is also predicted: from 5 to 10% will be added to the current prices for the autumn.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and there will be a certain vacuum while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
“The dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no powerful hysteria,” comments Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department at Otkritie Broker.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, and how NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then came the news on Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year it is completely moving to a floating exchange rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, it was the mark of 37 rubles that frightened everyone, the analyst continues.
So, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Alarming times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for the currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers due to higher import prices, says Alexei Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
The negative aspects include the rise in price of imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the cause of an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths down the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX Index fell by 1.67% during trading on Thursday, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by a massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions come to naught, and the ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
“We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar,” said Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
The British woman said that she spent many years thinking that she would die, after a misdiagnosis.
Caryn Rogers spent much of her teenage years thinking she only had a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Toot disease (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that lead to damage to nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK has reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with SMT because so little is known about the condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain gait, and squeezing toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
A mother of two, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot in school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical record when her doctor left the room and it was written there that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn’t, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that gap.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that's much less life threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have SMT.
“When he explained what a SMT is, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK charity SMT has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
Tax burden on Washington area entrepreneurs rises as economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year as the recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, a 3.8 percent increase from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses increased by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after successive years when bills were down in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, generates the least tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Largely, the increase in tax revenue is driven by a return to the previous level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While large states such as California, New York, and Texas account for a large share of these revenues, the same appears to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase from the previous year.
However, the observed return in real estate value has no similar effect on state and local tax revenue growth in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies’ tax accounts.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or a nonprofit that doesn’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center for State Taxation.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Incomes of entrepreneurs also seem to be on the rise, according to these figures.
Companies in the region declared state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although the trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three localities.
Growth in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, at 4.9 percent.
Virginia alone saw below-average tax revenue growth of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) at 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners — the transitional structure under which most small firms are organized — in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world championship in judo brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudanov, who competed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion in 2011 and 2013 Japanese Masashi Ebinuma.
Khan-Magomedov, in the quarterfinal stage, losing to his compatriot, won the consolation tournament and became the owner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium.
In the semifinals, she lost to the current world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation at this championship and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze, Kuzyutina won against Ma Yin’an from China, but after the tournament she still admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again, the obstacle to the Russians to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze in the piggy bank of the Russian national team was put by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his abuser was the former representative of Moldova Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two bouts and became the owner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with a ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a pause in competitions.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who took sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko with bronze completed the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Nifontov.
In the difficult battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt due to a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questionov, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his opponent in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Questionov could not go to the tatami due to injury.
Men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - Renat Saidov put it in the treasury of the national team, who performed in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But Russian judokas won team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a hard fight with a score of 2-3 lost to the main favorites of the competition - the Japanese team.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan-Magomedov and the strong-willed Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
According to the same scenario, a bronze match was also developed in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
“Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions,” Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I’m sure you can win them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person is in the eight strongest in the Olympic cycle, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in a sport such as judo,” summed up the results of the tournament, the Minister of sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various denominations, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, the sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone can be kings.
The debut album of the band Royal Blood is on sale - a new hope of British rock, which brought rock duets from clubs straight to the stadiums.
The duo Royal Blood only a year on stage, but already has an active nomination for the BBC music award, a tour to support Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut self-titled album a few months before the release received 100 thousand pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet-voiced representative of the “new R’n’B”, but about a duo of bullish-looking Brits playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
The duo has not in vain taken a name, which before that could be encroached on only by very desperate hairy metalworkers, and the blood of which kings flows, as it seems to them, in their veins, is also understandable.
We are talking, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It is probably too early to make predictions about the success of this enterprise, but it is already possible to assert something.
A dozen songs that took place in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer’s talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum part.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to hear than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful “Little Monster” and the closing track “Better Strangers” with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that’s not necessarily a bad thing, quite the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (they are more likely to be marked as successors to Mot?rhead), but they brought numerous rock duets from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is designed for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented in the early zeros of The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also in the very approach to songwriting.
The heroes of the retrorock of the zeros with great difficulty went beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance went to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and brazen that this pressure successfully drapes some secondaryity and hardness of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store — and video producer, and a hundred other things — is buying streaming video playback service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch video service Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a general-purpose streaming service - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which know-it-alls give (mainly old) games processing, as in "Mystery Theater", is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching them, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3am as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some outsider get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of view yourself can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I'll agree that speed passes, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, amuse.
But if it’s not about the game’s virtuoso or humor, it’s unlikely his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon do this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch would fold in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to get: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch, Shear, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and this channel shows no signs of fading, even — oh — as a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in the attack in 2004.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
They talked to the surviving hostages - almost all students, with the parents of the victims, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the Committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the Department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on a special project.
Having returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and conducted negotiations with terrorists, as well as with Vyacheslav Bocharov, an officer of the “B” Directorate of the FSB of Russia.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic was the fact that Beslan did not have these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has at least some relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
Impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan can not be forgotten, and I hope we coped with our task,” Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics studio of Rambler & Co., which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s tenure in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, Renhap reports.
The launch was made around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma introduced a draft law providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the base of legislative activity of the lower house.
Its authors were State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more rapid and effective ensuring the rights of Russian citizens to the safety of personal data and the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is rushed by the parliamentarians, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indicating the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offending sites - an automated information system "Register of infringers of the rights of subjects of personal data".
This law was adopted by the state Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, First Deputy Head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data stores of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation will be able to rent them, for example, from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that today already provide their servers.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers willing to cooperate in this area,” he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems - they will receive technological opportunities for placement,” Levin said.
The Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is adopted, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking of air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism to inform the user about where the record is made, the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.
A participant of the test with a bucket of ice water dislocated his jaw
Isabella Roberts from the UK screamed so much when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of the face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went to pain wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so fiercely when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I was screaming, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck," she told The Mirror.
It's a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn’t close, it got stuck, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they began to laugh, but I had to be urgently taken to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to adjust her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Militia handed over to the Ukrainian military more than 400 prisoners
The “Army of Novorossiya” claim that shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
The militia as of 10:00 on September 1 handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossiya.
He added that “air defense forces in the area of the village of Mereshki shot down a Su-27, violating the ceasefire agreement.”
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the shelling of the Luhansk airport.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia over the night managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"Losses in the enemy's manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people", - summed up the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 captured servicemen and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the “Army of Novorossiya”, “resisted the attempt of the National Guard in violation of previously reached agreements to withdraw heavy equipment from the area of the environment.”
Then the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two infantry fighting vehicles, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the area of Ilovaisk in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on the condition that the enemy surrenders weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense “Donbass” Semen Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday from the “cauldron” came another 14 people.
In his Facebook Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are “captive of the 137 regiment of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense of Russia denied reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of introduction of new sanctions by the EU
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions.
In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the “conclusions” of the European Council on August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on “absolutely unsubstantiated allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,” the agency said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is susceptible to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged “dialogue between the warring parties”.
Also on the website of the department it is noted that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is growing.
Recall that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the measures introduced for the period of validity and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
Also, the Australian government announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Clever Ways to Save on University Textbooks
With the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second year, came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from undergrads, offering them nominal compensation so they would delay selling them.
"My maths textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the past semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, however, students have a range of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and are often significantly cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, says book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is the introduction course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buying in an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 on the price list, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Purchase of used
If you don’t mind someone else’s markings or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" sells for $93.49 at Chegg.com.
Matt Casadey, a 25-year-old fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the textbook Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business.
The book sold for $48.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, suggest that students ask their professors if they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are not important for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Rent
It is worth thinking about renting textbooks, if you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them and do not want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may be issued for markings, underscores and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting a "Mathematical Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $ 61.
Bracey says that students of literature can often find the most favorable prices, since many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the prices of the book, as this ensures that you are looking for the right text for you.
Before ordering online, Holt says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed by four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the complete inefficiency of the Fund for the development of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of priority development areas in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TOPs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve the list of priority development areas in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also outlined the main tasks to ensure the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive with regard to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region.
We will remind, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why “Guardians of the Galaxy” Couldn’t Save the Box Office
Sylvester Stallone’s “The Expendables 3” returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing for returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz’s “home video” only grossed $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children’s films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 also disappoint with revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, perhaps it's the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year ever for children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely "functioning" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday of May and July 20, for 2013 and for this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of this year’s films is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in the changing viewing habits and growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-released Disney movie The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must acknowledge this and not try to chase after what came before.
In contrast to the current drop in the box office in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming service reached $ 1.2 billion, almost double last year’s figure of $ 837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth to his dire predictions.
Due to the fact that in the summer of 2015 several potential box office hits are expected, including “Avengers: Age of Ultron”, “Minions” and “Yursky Park”, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
"X-Men" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in box office revenue simply "cyclical," telling the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the catering service prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat a pickle than a bad mozzarella,” laments the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered to him by suppliers in return for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan stocks should last for another couple of months.
What do I do?
Moving to Russian?
In 2005 I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat there was on carts only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don’t know, maybe things have changed there.
But the other day they brought me fish from the Far East for a test.
So she turned out to be rotten!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is suspended in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It needs to hang off to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it with local beef.
Then they asked me: where did you get such tender meat?
I said: it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Most" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Color cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, “Well, we have to make money too.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy Far Eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price it turns out that this is a superdelicate.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "For the first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants do not know what will happen to them when the stocks of cheese run out

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and offal from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants began to have a cheharda with suppliers: prices for products increased, it is necessary to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, this will affect expensive restaurants with monokitchen of France, Italy, Spain, in which products were supplied directly from the “mother” countries.
The general population has had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014 Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban Atlantic salmon fry and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
The Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be further eased.
In the meantime, some of the restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the company "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergey Mironov, restaurateur, owner of the Restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it can take two to three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to refuse 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu - to process.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine are already beginning to replace dishes, for example, a steak made of marbled beef - to befstroganov, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company, said.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish the Italian mozzarella from the Russian one went there.
Although it will be difficult for Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace,” Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones.
But there are also many restaurants that will hardly be affected by the sanctions.
These include institutions with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Vai me!".
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillets, we do not use exotic greens.
In the establishments of Kolbai not a single dish has been removed from the menu yet.
Timur Lansky, owner of restaurants "Chaikhona N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions also do not bother: he will have to change only lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS, it is cheaper to get tenderloin, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olymboy Artykov said that he plans to increase the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
Restaurants of fast food, which responded to the request "Money", also quite calmly respond to sanctions.
McDonald’s said that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Department for work with suppliers Subway Russia, about 80% of the products the network purchases in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, “sanctions products” generally occupied no more than 4%.
Sanctions and noodles "Vokker" did not affect.
KFC, Burger King and Tiny Potato did not respond to the Money request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hunchback
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that because of the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"For products for" Grabley "prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant" Cherry Mio "- twice", - says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovskiy.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork,” complains Sergey Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
Chicken meat has increased by 35%.
Expect prices from China, maybe they will cool hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned increase in prices by 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, - Cancer says.
According to statistics, the growth of catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the lowest rate since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: while most restaurateurs stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the swings in purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow city hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play a waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with a funny name "There is time."
“We have long been going to make a holiday of local food, and here just sanctions, we rushed, organized a festival,” says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on cooking borsch with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the suburban "State Farm named after Lenin", cheeses from the Russified Italian Jay Close.
"Salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced with another fish of salmon breeds from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop "Your People".
We catch mink, keta, quiche, humpback, chavycha - "royal salmon".
Yes, they are not as fatty as Norwegian salmon because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You pick it up, it doesn't even move.
And you will not hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella domestic
In the window of his tent are shrimps with the tag "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Import of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The shop has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the introduction of sanctions, it served another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple things".
Now Galkin received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, he says.
We went crazy and tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, they're preparing me a portion of Philadelphia with a keta.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is our, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "Your people" there are even rolls of halibut and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, to replace the Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered to us", - the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev gives his explanation.
The situation is about the same with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the project LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will primarily benefit large producers of other countries,” Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are reviewing the substance of the claims to determine the actions necessary to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
No one really knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald’s closes across the country, the scenario will be very different.
"Europrotocol" instead of a certificate of traffic police
Cash payments can be received without a certificate from the traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidelines, according to which from September 1 of this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate from the traffic police.
We are talking, however, only about those cases when the accident was registered on the “Euro Protocol” without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars participated in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached an agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments for the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be registered on the "Europrotocol", drivers who have been involved in an accident call the traffic police.
After all, in the presence of a casco policy, it was impossible to receive compensation for it without a certificate from the traffic police.
The parameters prescribed in the draft guidance are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the “Europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment on insurance in connection with an accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit on the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it can not be higher than the limit specified in the Casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both employees of the traffic police and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules for payment of cash.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the traditional Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident, because this is more reliable.
And yet it is not known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
Savings certificate will be named and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates for bearer, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates for bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, since the rates here are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since it is not necessary to make contributions to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) fund.
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken due to small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV, control 98% of the profile market, will suffer from it.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency’s estimates, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the DIA, is that the customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his license, try to get money in the DIA.
Some investors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments for these certificates in case of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court,” the DIA said.
The problem is, of course, far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, since they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If it were the case that the instrument is not insured in the DIA, along with it would prohibit metal accounts, in which citizens' funds are counted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one has yet attempted to exist.
The fact, most likely, is that bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which can actually act as quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is practically beyond control: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing out, such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must be a personal security, which must be stored in a depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of the irrevocable contribution, which bankers have long dreamed of, is introduced.
NATO Summit: The First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Steven Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have come from all over the world, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the militants from the terrorist group “Islamic state”, reports August 31 ITAR-TASS, citing a decision taken after a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It is reported that Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8 thousand assault rifles G3 and G36.
Deliveries will be made until the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On September 1, Mrs Merkel will make a government statement on this topic in the Bundestag.
Until now, Germany has not supplied its weapons to “hot spots”.
Opinions of the people of Germany about the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the “Islamic state”, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militiamen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezimennoye (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
It is specified that the incident occurred today around 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage bushwalkers were taken by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man set out on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was sent, which included local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found around 11 pm near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and hurt his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were picked up on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met.
Negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian Economic Union.
Although the situation around Ukraine can not stand the delay, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions in this regard fell away on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other Eurasians with the Europeans saw in the TV news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader set an example of refined politeness, it was the behavior of a man who had just hit the jackpot - and plans a decent old age in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenka helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimation of a 20-year-old president.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenka, gives grounds to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results have been achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization, and negotiations on international security have been held with the United States.
The U.S. has even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only spurred this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenka’s movement towards political diversification will be will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to host meetings in the EU + CU format.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosyanchich only said “Fire” that against the backdrop of resolving issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of top officials in a new format.
A drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked about it by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not against Minsk remaining a central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” acquires the status of a fully hand-held European leader who helps solve a global problem.
European Farmer's Best Friend
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included European commissioners for trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion that the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the fears of the CU countries under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU, established at the meeting, looks like an achievement on a larger scale than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Commissioner for Trade Carl De Gucht, however, noted that EU representatives “came to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa.”
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still itself under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, former presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the opportunities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to Russia bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, supply chains are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin chided Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes,” Romanchuk stressed, “are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business desperately needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, - continues the expert, - is due to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not mind to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $ 4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very popular.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the owner of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the sanctions of Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission currently offered farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president may propose that Brussels work together to minimize the consequences for euro farmers.
This can raise Lukashenka’s authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the CU + EU format is being denied, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
“It was your proposal to gather, without any pressure to discuss, not from the bay-barracks to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time,” he said in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department carefully emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals when organizing interaction between the EU and the Customs Union on its land, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, put forward and promote the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has successfully proven itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, we will see all the disadvantages and advantages.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made on this matter," Liksutov said.
The deputy mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workload to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently started construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient bypass infrastructure, then it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy mayor said.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking has significantly unloaded the capital’s streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
We will remind, on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Sinner's Boredom
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez’s “Sin City 2: A Woman Worth Killing For” revolutionized everything you’d expect.
The first “Sin City” (2005), shot with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the chain of “thesis-antithesis-synthesis” (if we mean the noir universe by the thesis, and the comics space by the antithesis) that is fundamental to modern thinking.
From now on, it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
Sin City 2 is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar from the first "City", although, here, rumbled Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended his life in an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to snatch - in the role of a folk vigilante - knives and other axes with chokes.
But the old people are literally elbowed by newcomers, as if breaking into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His - lustful-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, cannot be distinguished from Johnny in the face - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, are demolished to characters with inexorable regularity, is not a problem and not even half the trouble.
These are not people, we understand that these are noir archetypes: a fatal bitch, too confident a player, a detective caught in the "honey trap" of sex, a corrupt ghoul-senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, then this is no longer a movie, but an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
In addition, even in this chaotic world there is something permanent.
Battle whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan no, no, and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the “City of Sins-2” is different.
Frank Miller was good because as a draftsman he skillfully combined comics and noir, and as a director - turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
The comic and the noir are two aggressively opposed "realitys."
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, the same time when Dashiell Hammett's novels Bloody Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The Glass Key (1931) created the canon of noir, then called hard-boiled school - "cool school".
Pulp fiction.
The comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popeye - the eater of spinach, giving him the heroic power, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "Avengers".
But in any movie based on comics, there was something flawed: the drawn characters stubbornly did not want to become screen flesh, remained pretenders in the “real” world around them.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of “existence”.
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsythes, what Thibaults and Rugon-Maccars, what even Bolkonskys and Rostovs are generally conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned what it means to work as a paramedic at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, were, at least, close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lowsey, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is not the American version of social realism.
The first “Sin City” was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic revived, not shy of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a “real” film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammett’s pen.
And picturesque details like severed heads, with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of the neonoir.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but the capitulation of Miller-Rodrigues’ radical style to the comic book tradition.
This is largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second “Sin City”, you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside of which snow falls a toy cloaca.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody mist, but by and large what’s the difference?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, albeit on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who walked on a crooked path or, say, tell inconsolable parents that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place for sin in the city, there is no sin but the norm.
Boring, like any norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.
In fairness, for the sake of domestic hire, he gave this unleavened sin a small, but a peppermint.
Titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person’s fingers are broken with forceps, this gives infernal humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France's Socialists Must 'Shut Up and Get France in Order,' Says Key Ally to Francois Hollande
Mr. Vall called on the deeply divided left to “show a warm attitude” to the attacked socialist president, whose reshuffle has not found approval from the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, causing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposals fueling the conflict, it should loosen the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande pleaded with his Socialist Party comrades to remain “one” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put a stick in the wheels, coming to the meeting of dissenting MPs from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future”.
Marine Le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed disdain for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying she did not imagine Vall’s new government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last even summer.
"And the new will not last autumn or winter either," Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for parliament to be dissolved, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France’s ruling party suffered a rout in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande’s presidency in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Cyans Poe University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"City without drugs" was left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional ministry for state property management to the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The Agency intended to recover from the organization more than 7 million rubles. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the Fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice did not appear in court, which is why the decision was made to refuse consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO Directorate could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
Representatives of the fund were also not contacted.
We will remind, we are talking about the mansion, which was occupied by the Fund in the city center on the street Belinsky, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by the ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk region filed a lawsuit in the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded to recognize the agreement of free use of the mansion-monument as unconcluded.
According to the Directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not include significant conditions for renting a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th arbitration court of Perm, which was granted.
Subsequently, the Fund filed a cassation appeal against this decision in the same court, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the fund began to pay rent again, the head of the city Evgeny Roizman told about it.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free, recognizing our services in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise," he said.
Tatiana Drohaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the City Council of Yekaterinburg, United Russia Alexander Kosintsev, offered the mayor of the city, the speaker of the City Council, Yevgeny Roizman, to resign.
The reason was the criminal case against arrested on suspicion of murder of the pensioner of the deputy of the city Duma Oleg Kinev, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Eugene Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of “slander” (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, the general director of the Legal Center "Protection", appealed with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog posts that she was involved in crimes that allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone to be converted into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple should present its new developments, in the press there are more and more leaks about what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources of the American media reported that the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with the function of a mobile wallet as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which a mobile wallet function will be available in the new iPhone 6.
The companies themselves declined to comment on the matter.
This feature allows you to make payment at the cashier of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first built-in technology NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the box office.
NFC technology will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies included in the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, allowing users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French foreign Ministry: the position of Paris regarding the supply to Russia “Mistral” does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said about the unchanged position of Paris regarding the supply of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia.
“I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande), made by him in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France,” Nadal told RIA Novosti.
So the representative of the French foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruise closes $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm owned by Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a representative of Apollo declined to comment on the information.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from middle-class growth in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are racing to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting held a 28 percent stake, Apollo held a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents for the first public offering of Prestige Cruises.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Suspend Chinese Representative's Speech A Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving a Chinese flag.
The standing committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday set out the procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to take part in Hong Kong’s 2017 presidential election.
All candidates must first gain the support of a majority of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for the Democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has forced Democratic movement activists to once again pledge to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business center and staged a sit-in.
Li's briefing is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Rongshun, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
Students said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is due to the desire to repay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative management on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saeb Arikat, the world community should call Israel to account for “ongoing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.”
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the “statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin talks on the “statehood” of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to hint that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be reassessed to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin’s call for the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy it has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin condemned a Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the seized territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes peace talks will take place in the near future as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for parliamentary elections on Oct. 26 and as government forces attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions is a “captive of illusions.”
“We must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine in order to meet the interests of people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to soothe fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman’s intervention to correct Putin’s “misinterpretation” underscored the Russian leadership’s decision to behave differently towards the separatist uprising in the east than the open takeover of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed widespread support for staying inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing over to the Kremlin actual control over territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical seaside resorts.
In the regions between Russia’s Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections, weigh in on constitutional amendments that would give the breakaway regions more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say fears it is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This entailed large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a 500,000-person steel port that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airborne troops captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a number of explicit photos depicting naked Jennifer Lawrence, got on the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star of the “Hunger Games” Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strafsky and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly had their photos stolen as a result of a leak from iCloud.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York City, reportedly told a news website that the hacking was “shameful” and that those targeted “feel like they’ve been invaded.”
It is assumed that the hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she lies by the pool with her bare chest.
Palmer's film credits include Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strafsky and the actress from Forbidden Reception Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Putting photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, is no different from the sale of stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
Discovered a potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities
The massive hacking of the accounts of the stars may be due to a vulnerability in the Find My Phone application.
A potential scenario for the development of events described the resource The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in Python, which allowed you to pick up passwords to the service Find My Phone Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same bunch of Apple ID logins and passwords are used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the search method to find the password from Find My Phone.
With this method, various combinations of characters are consistently introduced, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the service Find My Phone the number of input options passwords unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and inform the user about the hacking attempt.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to find a password for their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to it to select passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the account of “stars”.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared extraneous records
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there was previously a wave of malicious actions using this service.
Hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told media that cloud security was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also previously hacked.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud as described above, then there could be stored a password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web failed to get comments from Apple about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian pentathlon
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree was published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and appealed to the Federation of modern pentathlon with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the national team of the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in the personal championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
She still holds the leading position this season.
According to the rules, to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain a special permit from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world in blitz (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete became the winner of the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
TFR stopped the investigation of the crash of Tu-204 in Vnukovo

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of a person
Angry facial expression is biologically universal for mankind, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States found.
They described their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - shifted and lowered eyebrows, elongated lips in a thin line, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and even blind children from birth who have never seen it, notes the study's lead author Aaron Sell.
As part of a large research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion arose to effectively conduct disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his conditions, and he conveys this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and turn to violence, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer forceful methods of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining”, scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression of the face should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thereby force him to agree to his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated a face on a computer where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or absent, and showed them to the informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or forward chin separately did not make the face evil, the person depicted with such traits is physically stronger, the study participants unanimously recognized.
The anger of man, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one's own power, forcing one to agree and obey.
A person inflates their nostrils and presses their lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that shows off its fangs.
Anger is “launched” by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tobey.
