We must respect their wishes.
How did you convince her?
I've been to Sapporo before.

We'll try our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We sat at the bottom of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.

Writing SMS while driving is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.

Why did you shave off your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The stalk of the fork was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain himself to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice still rings in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the chance.

What did Tom ask you?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
Was that what you were looking for?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where should I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?

Take them to the hospital.

What's the weather like?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.

I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living out of town?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.

Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which is better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!

Did you tell Tom?
I am!

Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.

No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.

I have to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me just as well.
I'd like some coffee.

I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom made pancakes.
He dictated a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pyjamas?

Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.

Run, chickens!
I had a bad dream last night.
The network is huge.
I'm sick of you!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn’t as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say the movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we are late due to heavy rain.
She appears to be healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Take care of your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to my coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom is winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.

I didn't know it would be impossible.
Have fun?

Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.

What did you find out?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we will climb to the top of the mountain.
She and I both know each other.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
I read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His gray eyes glistened and sparkled, and his usually pale face was animated and covered with blush.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands turned blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom’s hands.
I learned to study and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.

Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did the moustache suddenly come into fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to spend that much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom's wearing a pirate suit.
It's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why wasn't I asked?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he claims to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Bluetooth, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He wore a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
In fact, I never spoke Portuguese.

We had no idea Tom was going to do it.
Another day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to get an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He hurt himself when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you monitoring your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald’s is world famous for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom is a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice encountered while waiting for an answer was a sudden howl. It was a loud noise, so sharp as to break her eardrums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary take things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why is Tom not sleeping?
As he wakes up, so will he respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your name.
A monkey climbed a tree.
The language I am learning is very complex.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can you solve this?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There are 20 floors in the building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
Next month I will be very busy.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait.
There was a strong wind.
Tom did not have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as an ass.
I think we can count on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a premonition that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got a little mustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in a foreign land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Be afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough to eat.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
This is a risk we cannot afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it very often.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who doesn’t admire them?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
What are you wearing?
From milk you can make butter, cheese and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, do not forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You weren't thinking of asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve the problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's a spat.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she could stay the night.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was tricked.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who is Tom playing?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me that's not true.
Won't you come in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom is taller than you.
Tom had no trouble finding a job.
Is this book publicly available?
Could you please speak up?
I'll tell Tom to get in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please contact me, only Yakov Matveevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took longer than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.

“Hello,” Tom said.
Where are you going?

I'm in pain.
She had no food.

They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.

I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You have to find another way out of this situation.
Disappear.

Thank your son from me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?

The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking of trying similar things.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is my first time cooking grilled meat at home.

Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You mustn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.

It will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.

Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.

What do you have against her?
He likes to sing.
I have to clean up some tails.
Is Tom okay?
I said yes.
Fortunately, Tom is much better today than he was yesterday.
I don't know much about Tom.
I can't pay him today.
Since I rock the press every day, you can finally see its relief.
Tom wants to run away.
Tom was alone.
Tom's coming with me.

We want to make learning effective, interesting and exciting.
I'll protect you.
I live on Park Street.
That's best for you.

I'm falling.
I couldn’t come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.

I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
You still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.

I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'm gonna have to get by with these old ones.
Tom doesn't think there's life on Mars.
I can't spend the whole day here.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I went to see Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
Those gloves belong to him.
She doesn't look more than sixty years old.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done it many times.
Don’t play poker with them.
Tom is very upset.
I'll call her right away.
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building as me.
Don’t blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers on the stove.
They took her.
Mary could have done it if she had.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with the lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
This is the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I think about them all day.
I can neither read nor write.
How's Tom?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
X-rays showed that two fingers were broken.
Tom said Mary was hungry.
Tom had to go there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a bit.
Laws must be obeyed.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I do it for money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I have the bill?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary wore two sweaters.
If you see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to hire them.
I'm sure he's smart.
Which way should I go?
Were you born there?
I'm not hearing that anymore.
He said it was nine.
The butterfly was flying.
There's no time for that.
Both suitcases are mine.
Prices are rising.
She's not wrong.
Today I will finally tell Tom what I really think about him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I love winter.
Show me a picture of her.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom certainly doesn't think so.
He called me just as I was about to go to bed.
If I can do it, so can you.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
