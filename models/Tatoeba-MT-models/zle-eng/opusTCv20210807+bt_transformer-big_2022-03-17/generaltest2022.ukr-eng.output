In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents had time to hold a rally before the military fleet with equipment arrived at the place for dispersal.
“We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there,” said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests in Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and regional councils.
This area, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, is wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Vladimir Zelensky awarded Kherson a special title "City Hero".
On February 24, the president of the Russian Federation Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the AFU is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city - ed.) - people who pulled a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the OOS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we can not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we are stating.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but “we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them.”
“People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something - and I do not think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million casualties, everything comes to an end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust, when there's nothing left, there's no people."

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become necessary to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine noted that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by following the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kiev region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

Bulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse from the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
And nothing surprised me at all. What happens is exactly what I was sad and expected...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and did not doubt for a moment that in the event of an occupation, my family will not spare the suburbs of Kyiv.
For I have been and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to take a copy of the shooting case of his great-grandfather: the whole matter is more than a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, the guilt denied.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-yard" nobleman, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the plowman and feeder of young children to execution.
The family did not even know of the burial place.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the penal case, there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
Apple from the apple tree is not far away, as you know, falls ...
The shooting trio that doomed the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia such as the Immortal Barrack, which qualitatively remind us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It was as if files with child pornography were found on a computer, they were put in prison for it, and he died quickly there.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
Above the thousand-year-old Ordinian tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then over what turned out to be, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 French film Chekist, that's what it was.
You saw my photos in the bathroom.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough?
Sorry, I have no one to ask.
I was wondering if you know where the kids went because Galya can't find them.

You are very helpful, thank you!!

I was sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.

As reported by “European truth”, this writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the version on the APC Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire over 30 kilometers away.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr in the shortest possible time will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is this us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?

Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I take it that we're together. That we're a couple.
I'd say there's a lot of work to do after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.

Because I'm worried about everything going well!?
Because with these excarnations, we didn't even talk about it!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm silent about myself (to me it's just a peak that can't be reached)!
How are you feeling today? after the party?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Kolya and I didn't translate the test well yesterday.
I will ask Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek)) that I at least a little help with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If possible, I’d like to set a deadline over the weekend.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that there were no mistakes.
Thank you for your test tasks.
We hope so much for that too.
She is very happy with any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall No29 is designed specifically for filing and processing applications for assistance

No need, I'm just a person
Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I didn't go. Yes, it was hot. That's what I can do! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're out of town for a long time?
A year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass shootings of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility to our history.”
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The fight has to go on.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its blockaded cities and let them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight.
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be collected
All were sick only Lydia not sick they had Omicron a new kind of covid
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this card instead of the car.
Call for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 pounds.
Serhiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries for the untimely delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, and the unwillingness to “annoy” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast “The Swearing Questions”, together with the editor of “European Truth”, we talk about how exactly the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed at the talks with Russia can become the second one.
What do you think is here
I have in volt partner marked that my application is under consideration.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to me, I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he asked me to get married, and two days later he died.
God has decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find a home, and I am very happy about this - now I have a place to live and have a place to be with my child.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “they have never done this before”
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously refrained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogojic near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of a shot down rocket of the invaders shattered a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgoroda said that a “Ukrainian shell” allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing themselves into a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have been able to do.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of power, emotion, and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While Biden is strongly against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The money you collect is better to give to people more in need.

Many of our managers, in our work did not give wages.
Where do I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?

Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.

These are heroic leaders who without fear go to the combat zone, soothe and help refugees in cars, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian aid into cars.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipelines and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people for 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.

The Foreign Election District of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting facilities in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the district election commission for the Foreign Election Commission is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign Election District, only state-wide votes are held: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referenda.
Local elections are not held.

Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
The head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak said that Russia is beginning a “fake operation” on the weapons, which are transferred to us by the allies.
Yermak's direct speech: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "knock down" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the destruction of S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scripts of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from the allies, and it is massively switching to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to warn you about these fads right away.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Sorry, forgot to ask how much boule is worth per month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation”.
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a "violation of international law".
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who had left the area after occupying it for weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of the executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubt about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that the image of Buchi is “another staging of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia’s Investigative Committee issued a statement announcing an “investigation” into Ukraine’s dissemination of “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shootings in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of allegedly civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian - were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
Looks like the victims were killed from close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kiev." As the occupiers vilely exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
In this list, there is another item about which there is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
From about mid-March, the Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military range.
Ukrainska Pravda searched for the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” was taking place and whether there were ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took from there children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine on swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true flakes, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They didn’t have their own cars, and no one took the suburban buses anymore.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
A total of about 40 people hid in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They say, "Is there anyone?" - I say, "Come out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said: "The Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a squad of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO Viking, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - the UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked me what was missing.
We say water, she had a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So it was they who, after looting the store, brought the sausages and said, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, they support Ukrainians and are good in general: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov, too, but we can't do anything, because there are our families there."
And basically they didn't fight, they went to rob shops, they looted.
The chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg with a St. George ribbon, and the other with his white scotch and called it a “militia”.
They came to Ukraine unprepared.
I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: “Do you have artillery?”
Moreover, we had assembled troops - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to reveal whether they were their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - our constantly got into it from "Bayraktar".
But these came and told us that the APU is no more, but there is “Azov”, and, according to them, “Azov” is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The narration “Kiev has already given up” has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - it was about Bucha, Gostomel, thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go in or out.
To which they replied, "Then feel sorry for your children's psyche!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either "Cities" or mortars.
And then flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit to the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it is for traitors of the motherland - they say, "you will be shot there, they will sell you to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnings, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately take the equipment to them.
A lot of caponires, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket is firing, and it can be seen that Iskander was working in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
Its leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I'm a hooker, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenka will not stop until these thieves are killed.
Poor people are suffering!
Lukashenka is so good!
As he says, so it will be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: “You are already traitors!”
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with documents - the daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the station they said that no one would take a bus without passports.
I would like to say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were placed in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanitarium.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an inside carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the ranges.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their ranges are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, we decide what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian ones.”
Marina lived on the territory of the military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything, and we are always waiting for you!

On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the joyful news - the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the village elder Motyzhin Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewers.
Both sides of the route 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go home, no one will be home.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes “European truth”.
“All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So what if, for example, we are talking about Mariupol, when you are losing thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their positions, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
Asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “Not yet, not yet.”
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have had a different appearance.
“It would unfold differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,” he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
My dream is to end the war and go home.
Write me anything you need, please.

And then he made me an offer.
“There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and it was hailing.

“I tell her that the ‘repair of the TV and radio’ was delayed because of the imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to be fooled when calling.”
“For a whole month we hide from the mother-in-law of the war.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in the Spots (cat - UP) on the leg and hind legs licked fur - it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spit, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her “incognito” for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
“For 33 days, I lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was there formally came, as always, for several hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours. "
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of my mother-in-law’s time is spent in her room.
It sounds bad - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I was hiding in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. It's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk to me about anything but war.
I asked my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It is April 17 - I have two apartments cleaning :)
Good evening, I did not think about it :)

The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine defended Mariupol, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a member of the brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter page of Aiden Eislin, a British man who served in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, BBC with reference to Eislin’s family members and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin who spoke to him
Eislin tweeted: “It’s been 48 days, we’ve tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We didn't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war ends soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
Air Force journalists contacted the soldier's mother, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Eislin said about their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin’s unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to get into the hands of the so-called “kadyrovka” troops without weapons and bullets.
Also in social networks distributed an audio recording of a telephone conversation, which allegedly Eislin speaks with his familiar American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called “Islamic State” in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took an oath.
Aslin's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
Very interesting you have a tradition, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the bill 7176, which is entitled “On the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economy”.
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the economic sphere was... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat of such a law is understandable - it is an excellent basis for "tolerating" all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The same as before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill “takes off” under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take off - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written off as war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to resolve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company’s work can be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can it be prevented by the move of members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let’s imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly, since the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the solution proposed by draft law 7176 most likely will not be able to protect from the loss of the supervisory board’s ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to this!
People's Deputy, the author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: “many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (MIC), now need to be relocated” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information.”
For starters, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is the only one in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocating one or another enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, this argument does not stand up to criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of “emotional”.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let’s try to analyze some of them: “respectable foreign experts at the first word “war”, actually leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is at war.”
Firstly, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Also, do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 children with me.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of the Kiev region, which were released from the invaders, will introduce an enhanced curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm signal to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who had left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the upgrade of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously took the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

The Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets signal installation under Osipovich, which provides movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svoboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the power support of SOBR special forces, one was wounded.
According to "Spring", when detained, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces with the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of the “BZD” and the administrator of thematic resources “BZD” in “Vkontakte and “Classmates” Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports ?belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus under the Victory Plan.
Belarusian “rail guerrillas” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

US bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as law firms and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you if you will hear for housing information, you will let me know.
I would gladly rent a house with some decent girl.
If you know this, let me know.
For my part, I will not fail.
Thanks in advance.
I have not written to you another person Natalia 54 years.Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost
I think it is better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name since I was born :)
Good afternoon Mr. Reyrard! I'm sorry I didn't see it. I'll do it now and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to the medical office right now.
I need to work this hour another day.
What day is it better to come earlier? (maybe on what day is a little more work?)
Tomorrow I will listen, the Internet does not work well.
You're what you're gonna do.
Thank you .. something found from things,but from the technique there was nothing...
Both beginners, except for the alphabet, do not know anything
Nothing's happening.
May be 25.04 on Monday.?
Children can be taken with them, the toy is enough :)
Guessed about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But how will it be paid for, please, no credits.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do you have to take the clothes that you gave?
today is not my day. broke blinds in the living room. in the morning one. now in the evening another
Something has come from you, I don't see what
I am also very sad.
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
Do you only speak and understand Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and in line.
Radu honors Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
The journalist of the TV channel “1+1” Natalia Nagorna published on the morning of April 12 a video that was handed over to her by the military of the 36th brigade of the Marine Corps from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said, "The bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of “Azov” Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant “Azovstal”, which is held by the soldiers of the regiment “Azov”.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, while we stay here
2 hours drive )) walk, mom shop and back)!)
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The squadron of Czech drones from today began flights over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them will be used to directly destroy an enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” in Ukraine sent yesterday thanks to the Deputy Mukachevo city Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Guhr, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will leave their location a secret at the moment.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I did not worry, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can also without it
I'm worried we won't make it.
I’ll be back soon to work.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try to myself, but if there are any gaps, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in an old lady's village in Jiviv,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no housing
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll get up.
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still freezing out on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me the music you like.
I don't care what music you have.
Mom and Dad need to listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and it was raining. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But do not harm the destroyed houses, the harm of people who are being abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers abused the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, gutted the panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders tore portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Removed the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we have no such custom so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given
There is someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I live in a dormitory By twelve people will be here, and then they go to work
Hi, it's a little better.
I was in the creek today.
I already slept there today.
So we've made great progress.
I'll definitely bring the dumplings another time!
I don't have the strength to do it today.
Since I am repelled from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say in late April or early May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about it..
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't write off dinner for a long time and slept a little
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we will meet after your arrival)
He is modest, he has been learning a lot lately. I realized that he needs it very much in his life
Hi, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economy department of the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the manger.
On Monday I have to bring a confirmation of employment and cash payment for the nursery.
I'm leaning from Friday
I don’t do anything except sleep (and drink a lot of water)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you.
I need another analysis.
So you don’t have to go again.
Very poorly works drain tank, poorly washes. Need a master. We need to set up.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
Should you bring your children with you or feed them with you?
And now for a moment you can come to one question
If you still need help write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't really want you to raise funds from the beginning so people wouldn't think we were speculating on this!
But for online filling, I did not have two points:
I will go to bed to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Overnight
What a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It'll be good, because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army.
Collected some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we have to have an internet connection.
I want to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day that I was not at work is a pass
Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state.”
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansk direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
A special problem the enemy feels when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of combat operations, will continue strikes on the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or disable them.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka settlements, had no success and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the Golden area, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue storming operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of Vysopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske settlements.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We'll certainly try to make it, but I doubt it.
And how can you want to sleep and I hold you back
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, then tell me I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and even more 1+1. We do not need to configure :)
I'm going to turn on the TV here just to listen to the Czech language.
I'm running out of package rates for the month :)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
I'll see my father later, I'll see you later.
I read the ad on Facebook ,I guess Google wrote something in its own way . . . I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we have the things you brought, but are there things that are small on us that you can bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about work.
If the director is satisfied, then next week I can start to go to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it turns out, because it is very large queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team in the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study the Czech language in order to know perfectly, I dream to work for Teva
Friends are old and not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
You have had a hard time, too.
Over the past month, I’ve spoken to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed about your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because of why they are giving Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, laconicly answered Sasha. - Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others, artists, critics, writers, are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you — those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduza, Navalny’s organization, and a number of other places — have many of you done anything to oppose this regime?
Except for the rallies when they were still going on.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now must have placed a great burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a measure of freedom and democracy — messy even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the king’s back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think he's safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of grabbing and releasing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the stasis, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between robbing the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to level Chechnya again with the ground, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities with my own eyes.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the children who were killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're fed up with your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your fucking country, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your power that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle zeros, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-off, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found a better job.
Prices have gone up, haven’t they?
Moscow was festively shining and shining with chic.
When several opposition members were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the case did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of the Prime Minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev’s rule, most of you ignored it or kept quiet.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is flagrantly violating international law when there is such a great temptation to Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
At the end of 2011, my Russian friends woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidency as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out in droves to protest.
Navalny's name became nicknamed, you didn't go off the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"And what could we do?"
I heard it so often and still do.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who cheated on their European aspirations, they once seized Maidan — and never left it.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Police eventually opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and expel them if they do not do their job well.
Maidan did not like it very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there's little benefit to it.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We are not interested in politics,” he said.
And you hid in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, like new ones after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow started in 2012 - with their binges, public WiFi and hipster cafes.
In fact, the Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it is only getting better.
You've barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it then in an interview, because I didn’t understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw state snipers cold-bloodedly shooting my children's peers on the streets of Homs myself.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"First they came for the socialists, but I was silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade union members, but I was silent - because I am not a member of the trade union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.”
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really speak now - as, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or putting together a company for Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So, I’m sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians — or, it seems very likely, if he doesn’t — he will deal with you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went out to protest and still took place for a short period of time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even just a black square on Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment was given just for an anecdote, were not in such a distant past - and now they are, most likely, waiting for you in the future.
Then who will speak for you? Who will be left?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive on paper his superiority.
Given everything, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war continues at all.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know where everything is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a laugh, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still another one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not break out from you: because of the economic collapse approaching Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the province, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has already periodically happened, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been crushed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If there are more than 300 thousand, it will be stunning.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to things?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will experience understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be scared if I were you, too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the computer game chat and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes and die in a raw cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and will only increase further, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act cool, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
In the evening we will be at home
What do you see me as the press secretary
How often do you go to an expensive restaurant?

Working in the prosecutor’s office, I thought that I was building a career, spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I take monogamy and marriage seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people should love, respect, trust each other.
At the moment, I haven't met that.

She had an unpleasant situation.
When the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.
