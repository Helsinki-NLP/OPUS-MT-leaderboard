Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, thus confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve the level of preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to available data, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 the disease occurs in mild form, i.e. in the form of an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of cases of COVID-19 develop into a more severe disease with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in China's Hubei province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria by which WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on January 24, 2020, with all three returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, were in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily at 8:00 am updates the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, received from official sources, such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was calculated in 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to Italy data for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
Trends in the development of a truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK generally corresponded to trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material) on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK there were similar trends in the growth of cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already reported as of 8 a.m. on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite different stages in different countries, differences in the response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognizing cases of the disease and different rules for selecting patients for analysis for the presence of COVID-19, including “concrete” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already as full as possible.
At the moment, data on the admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only in respect of 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not provided).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current observation data, the subject of which is the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment provides scenarios for the loading of health system resources with estimated hospitalization data for COVID-19 infections in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped according to specific EU/EEA and UK regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a specific territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended, if possible, to provide units of the 2nd level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 contact infection, which persists for a long time, and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be observed, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is of great importance to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a subsequent shift from containment to minimization of consequences, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to think, take and adjust their response accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, then in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: at the moment, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications about the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further course and prevention of this disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which in 2020 fell on January 25, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection, were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.
Given the high degree of similarity with coronavirus (CoV), which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 called this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the accompanying disease - coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy to society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report dated January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), an outbreak that occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss known facts about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of common respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, that is, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a level of severity.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which suggested the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus.
On January 23, a quarantine was introduced in Wuhan, the city public transport stopped working.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of danger of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection affected all age groups, but mainly fell ill people aged 30 to 65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei Province and in nearby regions.
On average, from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis took 5 (2-9) days.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infections, coinciding with large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (-60), and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the sheathed spine (S) binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, genomic RNA, along with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports of the genome sequence SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
It is established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, the genome of which coincides by 99.98% with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease on the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease in patients of a lesser severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in terms of pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit IFN expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-length human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 ? in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, is assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in the recognition of coronavirus and infection with it.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were known to originate from bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans via civets and camels, respectively.
Using a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two coronaviruses similar to SARS, namely the coronaviruses of bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species has become an intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect a person; the route of transmission also remains to be clarified.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and colleagues suggested that the carriers of the virus from bats to humans were snakes, in the process, there was a homologous recombination in the S-protein.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-tailed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99% genetic similarity between the coronavirus of pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat up to 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block the activity of the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there is no data on the conducted detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, a virus that enters the host first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (ORRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humorous immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, based on 8,866 demographics, found an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with asymptomatic disease.
A 14-day quarantine for individuals who have been exposed to or infected with the virus has become a common practice.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which may be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the onset of the disease, shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia was noted.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies on chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates of symptoms: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained as a result of the last two studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation, a rate much higher than that of patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher proportion of deaths from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation is required by 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
In comparison with this indicator, the SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a June 2012 demographic study showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to the results of an earlier study, the basic reproduction index (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in the range of 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with a new virus is lower compared to the last two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clustering often occurs when infected within the same family or group of people gathered together for any reason or found themselves together on any transport, for example, on a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or sick people in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, having been discharged from the hospital, can become carriers of the virus again, and this is an alarming signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with leukocyte levels of <4-109/L, including leukocyte levels of <1-109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine aminotransferase and viremia.
Increased levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and in most patients there were increased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
In most patients with COVID-19, a chest X-ray examination revealed pathologies characterized by uneven dimming on both sides or “matte glass”-type dimming in the lungs.
Patients often develop SARS, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
With the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant violation of gas exchange.
Type I and II pneumocyte dysfunction lowers the level of surfactants and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte detachment, hyaline membrane formation and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the method of detecting RNA SARS-CoV-2 through a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used.
However, given the high level of false negative results, which can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
A similar situation was with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On February 14, 2020, a group of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR repetition, to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows to detect synthetic fragments of RNA SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 ? 10 ? mol / l to 200 ? mol / l.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and providing psychological support.
For treatment, it was proposed to use even the plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and also, perhaps, to a lesser extent affects other organs expressing ACE2, for example, the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, disruption and failure of the respiratory system are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, to relieve symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified technique of extrapulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals, which become the main cause of the development of acute respiratory infections and multiorgan failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in serious condition, the suppression of immunity is of paramount importance.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm, based on suppression of immunity, include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blockade of cytokine production IFN-Q, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone deacetalase inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity suppressors.
However, steroids in large dosages are not beneficial in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for pair studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, beta-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Blood sampling from patients cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a long time.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies exist in the immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, to offer mass application of this method before the specific therapy, it is required not yet carried out verification and not compiled explanations.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for the treatment of patients in critical condition requires a lot.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately move on to the mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China, in which Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment should be carried out taking into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study that compared treatment exclusively using Western medicine and combined treatment methods using Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms and medical care in the hospital were significantly less in patients for whom a combination of methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine was used, than in patients who were treated only according to Western methods.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to worsen symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group that was treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group that was treated only with Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the efficacy aspects of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques, or a combination thereof.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience a strong fear of acute and even fatal illness, and people quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Compulsory contact tracing and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as all other people who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in disrupting the chain of transmission from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapies used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out to create vaccines based on S-protein, the purpose of which is to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses.
However, before clinical trials begin, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in elderly patients, the model of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus continue to appear, emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (an average of 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine, and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
Being a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients manage to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the data of clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis of the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not (on average 66 years vs. 51 years), indicating that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and the initial diseases are closely interrelated and can distort the results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase and creatine kinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: To predict outcomes and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, chest X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the use of steroids for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic seems to be different in its characteristics from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, leading their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was thought to occur when patients are severely ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
A lot of work is currently underway in China, within the framework of which a general quarantine has been announced in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and a quarantine regime has been extended for almost the entire population, introduced in order to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2 virus distribution chain.
Although these measures are causing enormous damage to the economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients identified is decreasing, which indicates a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the attenuation phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in swabs from the nose and throat taken from patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was supposed to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to take control.
Like the SARS-CoV virus, the infecting ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely to weaken, and over time it will disappear or turn into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which means that an oral-fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been due to infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 class respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microdrops of fluid from potentially infected people to fly in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95-class masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhaling virions ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks stacked together, medical professionals directly in contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 class masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a suited protective gown to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95-class mask; it is possible the virus entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type goggles.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are strongly encouraged to wash their hands with disinfectants more often than usual, to try to stay indoors while maintaining self-isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproduction in human-to-human transmission and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within the city of Wuhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more drastic measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages of development, rather than calm the public; and (4) more often conduct targeted and effective exercises to increase the degree and awareness of the epidemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered all of China and at the time of writing this document has spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is a sense of SARS recurrence in the COVID-19 outbreak.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
SARS-related deaths are higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is asymptomatic, whereas patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive tests for the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the background of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any time.
Molecular simulations and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus invade airway cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transmission from person to person?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it periodically recur like the flu?
These aspects are paramount, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause a mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China at the end of 2019 again drew attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with high transmittance, but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronavirus infection is zoonotic, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of coronavirus-carrying animals can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their detection history, as well as their zoonotic origin and modes of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the course of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of envelope viruses with a single positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses with the largest genome of RNA-containing viruses, containing from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, were named due to their shape, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a corona.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins designated nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike-shaped protein (S), enveloped protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronaviruses, a number of lines of specific accessory proteins are also encoded.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronaviruses), while the type of betacoronavirus includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecific barriers, and some of them have evolved to dangerous pathogens for humans.
There are seven known human coronaviruses.
These include human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (SAR) and showing extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients separated from the nasopharynx who contracted the common cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that infection with the human coronavirus was considered generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the disease of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of people infected exceeded 91,000.
An alarm has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic in origin, sourced from bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms viruses have adapted well and in which do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world medically, scientifically, socially and morally.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will allow to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and factors limiting interspecific transfer.
Perhaps it will also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review contains general information about zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain of B814 was first obtained from a sample of nasopharynx-separated cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 presents an informative and illustrative history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966; this virus later adapted to reproduction in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise, and sore throat, with fever and cough occurring in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of the sucker mice.
Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus look similar to manifestations of infection with the HCoV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogens, for example, influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous around the world and tend to be transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS epidemic, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the causative agent of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding overactive spreaders, it was estimated that each patient could infect about two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pain, headaches, high fever, general malaise, and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.
Common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, violations in liver tests and an increased level of creatine kinase.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs can also be infected, including the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be lethal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open biopsy of the lungs of a relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been directed to the study of human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found to mainly affect young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, manifestations such as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis are characteristic.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases caused by it falls in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory disease, has been identified worldwide.
All four of these human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation entailing highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and stored in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia imported cases and spread through episodic secondary cases of infection in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there are more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In the period from mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, which is now, in hindsight, associated with an infection caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed "Coronavirus Infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly go into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transferability compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, which indicates the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
Firstly, coronaviruses transmitted to humans have a similar incubation period and duration of the course of the diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most often observed when infected with human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections, including nonspecific manifestations, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, interesting patterns are also noted, characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent virus transition (i.e., infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in stool samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity, and sustained spread following human transition.
All four human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it is possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract carrier restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be maintained.
They need to persist and multiply in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of contact with susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as community-acquired HCoV, at least for the time being.
But it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir medium continuously transports HCoV over time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate carrier right before or around the time it was introduced to a person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate lightning-fast and then passing it on to humans, increasing the extent of human infection.
HCoV can tolerate a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain transmission within the intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero patient SARS had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (wild).
Further studies of seroprevalence showed that in animal dealers, the prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus is higher compared to the general population.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not getting to the markets, in most cases, SARS-CoV was not determined, which allows us to conclude that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is possible that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate enhancers.
All of them seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a closely related CoV of bats, called SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none other than one that stands for WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a sample of bat feces, has been shown to use ACE2 bats, civet, and human as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, the serums of recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis assigns MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to those of bat betacoronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homologies of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats match by only 87%.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-breasted camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal smears of single-breasted camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed minor symptoms, but massive virus excretion.
It is noteworthy that infected camels isolated the virus not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main way of isolating the virus in bats.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and believably relate to human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides coincides 96.2% with the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute to them a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Presumably, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely case of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betacoronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these novel pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85-92% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with identity at the nucleotide sequence level being about 90%.
They cluster into two original differentiations of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
Conversely, the RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study of patients with pangolins also reported the determination of viral contigs in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembly and manual processing techniques to produce a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of a full-sized viral genome.
It is possible that pangolin has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related betacoronaviruses, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
Whereas the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the betacoronaviruses of pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates recombination between the betacoronavirus pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
It was reported that the bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in a North American tricolor sucker, shows a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate carrier could be camels.
For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV interspecific transmission events in the anamnesis.
When an interspecific transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and humans became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alpha-coronaviruses of bats, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been detected.
Between them is alpaca alphacoronavirus.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus has caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas received an alpha-coronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as the HCoV-229E virus gene pool, alpacas and single-breasted camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats give a rich pool of varieties of viruses for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats the “ideal spreaders.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to camels decades ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which evolved from an intermediate medium into a stable and natural reservoir medium.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to humans is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies should confirm or rule out several possibilities of interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or cutting down the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins can be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers into which a related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through carcase cutting and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the crossing of interspecific barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with single-stranded RNA, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderate-high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to a person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-stranded camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific co-evolution favorable to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3d-end of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch matrices during RNA replication.
During transcription of coronavirus DNA in a carrier that serves as a mixing vessel, thread switching often occurs.
High-homological full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create novel coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Host-virus interaction with respect to transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, another key factor important for interspecific transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
In this article, SARS-CoV recombination is given as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV strains and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different media, especially with respect to mutations on the RSD protein S.
In general, the RSD of the S coronavirus protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensely selects it.
RSD in SARS-CoV are amino acids, from 318 to 510, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, making interspecies transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSD that differ from human viral strains and civets, with 4 of these being in the receptor-binding motif to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S causes the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 to change.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectron microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between human ACE2 and the S protein of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine if any other coreceptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but to a different segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans following interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecific transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and limitation of the carrier.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-stranded camels and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful cross-species transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp dependence factors and subdue carrier restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
An unbiased full-genome screening of carrier dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology can provide good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since the viruses of bats related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been identified in non-structural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to have undergone recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-breasted camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs have been recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which most likely occurs as a result of getting rid of the virus from the provided selection pressures, for example, from the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to binucleotide deletion.
While an intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpaca alphacoronavirus exhibits a single-nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also due to the selection pressure on their tank carriers.
When bats were infected with coronaviruses, mild or no symptoms were recorded, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, activation defects of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the preregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and a low level of expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, simultaneously affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus, which, when penetrated into the new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the host.
Thus, it is no coincidence that over the past twenty years, three new human coronaviruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are associated mainly with hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same immune non-binding strategy may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasome is impaired in bats.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While bat betacoronavirus was found, the nucleotide homology of which is 95% the same as SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus whose nucleotide homology is 96% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in the markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
Pangolin betacoronaviruses, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the genes of pangolin betacoronaviruses may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses have attracted widespread attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing game markets and destroying civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of betacoronaviruses of pangolins, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-breasted camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the sake of controlling MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Because we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause disease outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the world.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There is a huge variety of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly to humans.
To reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between humans and animals, it is necessary to abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China.
After the severe tests, such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we need a better preparedness and response plan for such situations.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until there is a possibility of capturing new territories.
Although many of the properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
A better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires ongoing epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future disease outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the zoonotic origin puzzle, SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats passed the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, then it is necessary to determine how people came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Need to update diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspected illness” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our group published a short guide to the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides verified recommendations to combat this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspected disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations for diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19” (the seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of China.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially called coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a short reference guide and published it online on the website of the Military Medical Research journal on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, in the period from January 16 to March 3, 2020, seven issues of the “Recommendations for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published, and the content of some of its provisions changed significantly.
Recently, in a paper prepared by Zhou and co-authors, comments were made about our recommendations. They contained simple suggestions for diagnosis based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as providing valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.
We reiterate the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “Recommendations for diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19” (trial version 7) and the results of current studies, and their work needs updating.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspected disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of an epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of cases of movement or location of symptoms in the school of Wuhan and its environs or in other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case of the disease should be based on the case of suspected disease with the presence of one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR antibody test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) genome-wide sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies with IgM or IgG result;
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the results of continuous work of researchers searching for the optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou and others should be updated, since in it persons who do not have clinical symptoms are classified as a “low risk” group.
The evaluation system also needs to be clarified when conducting further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “cases of suspected disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said the two dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti Maitri clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be shut down for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
The operation of public transport was stopped from March 26 and was supposed to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide.
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people have died from COVID-19.
The border came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first death from coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries to have no cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that there were more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of the city’s citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days; results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state's domestic self-isolation regime had been extended by order until May 1.
Shops in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country, to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a limit on one package.
These restrictions were reported in the ads at the box office, as well as on the network page in Facebook.
Reportedly, citizens began to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a regime of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this amount to 4 packs.
The Coles chain said in a March 8 press release that with a four-package cap, “many stores are still buying up toilet paper too quickly — one delivery within an hour,” and called such demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI in a Facebook post published Tuesday called the trend “unexpected.”
According to a Woolworths representative, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this amount to two packages.
To make up for the shortfall, Coles began to order larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made inventories for a special early-sale stock on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to restock, but that was hampered by local authorities’ restrictions on truck travel schedules.
He expects growth in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, but at the same time there are fewer and fewer profitable offers available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to depletion of stocks, some stores can not hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenished stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the amount of stock is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of shortage of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn’t panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, a toilet paper company that also manufactures Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to ensure there are enough products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne dropped due to a lack of buyers on Labor Day, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 ABC Australia report, at first stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the amount of goods purchased, stating that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gallantry, hand washes and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, Sunday night it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of toilet paper Andres two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemic” characterizes only the scale of the disease, and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are engaged in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, monitoring of cases, as well as the mobilization of their citizens, ”explained the WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been tracked since its inception until continuous global spread."
Mr. Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We’ve also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then assigned it a new status - a pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: “This is just the beginning, it’s going to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, observing the distance between people, identifying and ensuring the self-isolation of people who suspect their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control, and closures of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus began to spread on the Internet, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people resembling them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the spread of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced as a result of reduced travel and closures of heavy industries.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and in early January 2020, an investigation was launched into the situation.
Cases of infection have mostly been linked to the wholesale seafood market of Huangan, so the virus is believed to be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China branch of Morning Post, whose information has not been verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China decreased, but began to unexpectedly increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China exceeded the number of new infections in China itself for the first time.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the many cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients 19 years of age and younger accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was formed in the country's population.
Statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted official policies prescribing not to test for only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China before January 23, 86% of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected, and that such unregistered patients became a source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from onset of symptoms to death was 6 to 41 days, with the most frequent period being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, and 75% of deaths had co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on deaths of patients with positive COVID test results performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not include deceased people who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual one.” His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S. This kind of accounting with incomplete data is often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also affected by testing volumes, the quality of health systems used, treatment regimens used, time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health. The mortality/disease ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
The data vary by region.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of deaths due to disease (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of deaths due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, a Penn State University researcher, argues that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to come to the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease ends, they begin to go out.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, says that “everything could be over by June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate for perhaps a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (perhaps 18 months or more),” physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever go away for good, because it’s so easy to transmit,” and that it “could become a seasonal disease, breaking out every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on the collective immunity and degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can tolerate the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhaging, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO claims to be in serious condition with the development of respiratory problems in about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of depression in the chest, a sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking and blue face or lips. If these symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical help. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis.
In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing people in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from several units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open cough drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets ejected into the air during a conversation, which are able to stay in the air for a longer time. Respiratory droplets may also be formed during exhalation, including during a conversation, although the virus is not usually carried through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests were positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmitting the virus to a pronounced manifestation of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. In domestic and other animals, a positive result was obtained for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people could touch.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with the help of household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole-genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin viruses and humans.
A whole-genome comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately this should be confirmed by analyzing the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (PT-PCR) of the infected secret or computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
The WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of them was published on January 17.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is being tested.
It can be carried out on breath tests and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of several hours to several days.
Usually a nasopharyngeal swab is used for the test, although a yawn swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging symptoms on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral opacities by the type of frosted glass and the absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society compiles an international database of images of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, when COVID-19 is identified, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A major study in China compared chest CT scans and PCR testing, and found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decoded more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and therefore could be considered a screening tool in infected areas.
To diagnose the virus using radiographs and computed tomography, convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed.
Prevention strategies include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using napkins when coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance oneself from people. Many Governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus spreads to populations where some members do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers caring for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent it from spreading further.
The use of mobile phone data by governments has raised concerns about privacy, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on developing solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data - for example, registering the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the user of the mobile phone was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he receives a notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing your hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand pollution, as well as before eating, after sniffing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel, the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in the event of a suspected COVID or its confirmation in an institution such as an office or day hospital, all spaces of such a room, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main way of infection.” Masks are also recommended for use by those caring for people who may be infected.
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask does indeed reduce the amount of face touching.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical tissue facial masks. China has highlighted the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Health officials in Thailand are urging people to make facial tissue masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has produced ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks on all passengers on trains and intercity buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; those residents who cannot purchase masks have been advised to sew them on their own at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions particularly hard hit by the outbreak are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can gather in one place, as recommended by US government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced, from 250 people (in regions where there were no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups that include more than two people. Elderly people and people suffering from physical contact with such diseases as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. CDC recommend them to stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began using the term "social health care".
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood in such a way that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation, instead of remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among others, recommendations were given to have sexual intercourse only with your regular partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have also imposed mandatory quarantine or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be quarantined on their own.
Persons in high-risk groups were prescribed the strictest quarantine.
Individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region largely affected by the epidemic were advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible exposure.
Outbreak control strategies include containment, suppression, or mitigation of the disease.
Containment of the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and is intended to track and isolate the infected, and also implies other measures of infection control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of an infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the equalization of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of health services being overburdened and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks, and self-isolation; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in facilitating the implementation of and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected individuals who are self-isolated and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fined for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines. Modelling in the UK and the United States showed that there are serious problems in terms of mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health care system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed if this happens earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not currently exist, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration, and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers improving the capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to assist in reallocating resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-urgent procedures where possible, identifying the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and enhancing intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of available devices.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could occur - the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection likely occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly associated with the wholesale seafood market of Huangan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass incidence of pneumonia of unknown origin was registered at a clinic in Hubei province, with which doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, who reported on this case to the Center for Prevention on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan’s central clinic warned their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police about responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation and main rail hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by January 20, 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already appeared in 6,174 people. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The national response included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people were in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the reliability of which has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, doctor Zhang Jixiang worked with a case of a mass case of pneumonia of an unknown type, about which on December 27 her clinic notified the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jianghan in the city of Wuhan.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, police warned doctors in Wuhan about responsibility for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
Initially, the China National Health Commission claimed that there was "no clear evidence" of the virus's ability to be transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later called “people’s war” by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, on January 23, a sanitary cordon and a ban on entry to Wuhan and back were announced, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city banned the use of personal transport.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also repurposed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools across the country were closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transport schedules have been changed and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a regime to control the movement of citizens was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of restrictions on movement in the open air. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case of transmission of infection within the country was registered in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases of the disease transmitted within the country was largely stopped, and the outbreak in China was brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the closure of the province under quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from March 28, entry for persons with a visa or residence permit will be suspended. The exact timing of the cancellation of this order was not called.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to reopen and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, a national three-minute “minute of silence” was held at 10:00 a.m., which opened the day of mourning for coronavirus victims declared by the country’s State Council and coincided with the Quinmin holiday, however, the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, observing physical distancing to avoid a repeat outbreak of COVID.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji gathered in Daegu.
The followers of Shinchonji came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the church's 9,336 followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, the highest level of anxiety was declared in South Korea.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea, and on February 29 this figure increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were confirmed to have the virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of trips, therefore, the flight schedule of airlines has been changed. South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best from the point of view of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application to all visitors from abroad, comprehensive testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as the expansion of testing capabilities, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that they did not isolate entire cities. Initially, South Korean society was divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president’s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they believed was the government’s inadequate response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in a single day for four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries sought help in testing for the virus in South Korea.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020, that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict long-distance travel, but heavy movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Amid claims to cover up the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
Iran’s parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on March 3, tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new coronavirus cases every hour and one new coronavirus death every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data that are reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial capabilities in terms of protection against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, made in Rome.
The number of cases of infection began to grow rapidly, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “Entry into and out of the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 people had already died in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies.

On March 19, Italy overtook China in terms of coronavirus deaths, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed coronavirus cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, with the majority of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy - a large number of elderly citizens of this country and the lack of an opportunity to examine everyone who today suffers from coronavirus.
The UK has responded to the virus most calmly of all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly enough and seriously to the danger faced by the country ' s population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement in which he recommended refraining from all travel and social contacts that were not of primary importance, inviting people to work from home whenever possible and avoiding public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages but no more than 2,500 pounds a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and outdoor activities to emergencies only.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide "people's livelihoods", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government’s leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the lack of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval until the end of February to use non-state test kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done as directed by the attending physician).
The Washington Post reported that by February 27, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported, "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's prescription, were waiting for their turn for tests for hours or days." After the first case of coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which was also soon declared by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools were canceled, and by mid-March, schools were closed nationwide. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London, informed the United States about predictions of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Readiness and Response Supplement Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to federal authorities to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were canceled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, with the exception of the UK, for 30 days starting March 13.

In general, the views of supporters of President Trump on how successfully he manages to cope with the crisis are divided.
Some officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. reliance on imports of critical materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in the journal Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict patterns of disease spread.
Based on the information of the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali has been named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its new coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency plan.
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.
On March 21, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities gave their permission.

On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
Before departure, a medical examination of passengers was carried out, and four South Africans who were found to have signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce their risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they all remained under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.

After the situation in China stabilized, the country also sent assistance to other countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma has sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 ventilators to Panama.
Ma has also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concerns about Chinese-made medical masks and test kits.
For example, Spain has withdrawn 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, providing only up to 30% accuracy, and the Netherlands has recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to be made in China, but later it turned out that they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and curb the spread of the infection.
The WHO noted clear differences between the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004, during which Chinese authorities were accused of classifying information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regularly provided updated information about the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year.”
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on the movement of influenza in Wuhan, the WHO representative Goden Galea noted that although “this measure was definitely recommended by the WHO”, it is also “a very important confirmation of the fulfillment of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place of the greatest spread”, and called it “unprecedented in the history of public health”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the announcement was due to “a risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said there was "no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international movement and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the world community for $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems in place to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries.”
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our preparedness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on February 11, WHO established the official name of the disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem".
As a result, the UN Crisis Management Group was established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO says, will allow “to focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak of the disease in a broader social and economic way.”
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint ad hoc group that ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to help resolve the situation inside the country and assess the “seriousness of the disease and its contagiousness”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district level, including urban and rural areas”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the probability of global spread of coronavirus would be raised from "high" to "very high" - the highest degree of readiness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement: “This is a test of every government on the planet for the reality: it’s time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the “worst-case scenario.”
Ryan also said that the current data does not serve as a basis for the announcement of a global pandemic by official representatives of the public health sector, and added that the announcement of the pandemic will mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO is “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on this issue”. WHO has been heavily criticized for its perceived inadequacy of the concept of a pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, the WHO Director-General, Mr Tedros Adanom, received a petition to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the human rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone was entitled to life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has created a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital hub provides information on country policy measures to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address quarantines and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for taking action to fight the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the provincial level were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus”, saying that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now turned into a global pandemic”, and this statement in turn has been criticized by some commentators who argue that this approach is racist and “distracts from the inability of the US administration to curb the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast gained access to a U.S. government cable that contained a communication strategy trick apparently devised by the National Security Council, with such references to the strategy: "It's all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in every way possible, including press conferences and television appearances." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a "propaganda push" to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is pushing hard for the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned due to US sanctions imposed on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
Regarding medical masks, disputes have also arisen between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of ventilators intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union in relation to the coronavirus-ridden Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said that “only China has reacted bilaterally.
This is not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favorable impression on the world community at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to provide retaliatory assistance if necessary.”
NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercise, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states — NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the exercise Defender 2020: “In the current crisis in the field of public health, the conduct of these exercises threatens the lives of not only the US military and many European countries, but also the residents of the countries where such events should be held.” The Iranian government has suffered greatly from the virus. About two dozen members of parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former political figures, have been infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter appealed to world leaders for help, saying that his country is experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic gave rise to calls for the United States to adopt social policies that are common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health care system and childcare, paid vacations.
Political scientists expected that this could negatively affect the chances of Donald Trump to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially divided because of President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they believed was the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed concern that the move will allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban an indefinite right to rule through decrees, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic conditions and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment, which arose due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in the work of suppliers.
Panic buying also took place in several communities; this led to a situation where essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This jump led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in the supply of medical products for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, buyers under the daigou system have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, severe food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illegal trade in critical products, which proved successful, avoided the acute shortage of food that was expected in Europe, as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to representatives of the industry, prices for agricultural products may rise.
The shelves of grocery stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure that the population was fully fed.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy affected China: according to media reports on March 16, the Chinese economy suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the government, as a result of which retail sales decreased by 20.5%.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub; therefore, the virus outbreak is believed to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to Agatha Demaray, an economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, market volatility will persist until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outweigh the effects of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
According to one estimate, made by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain can exceed $ 300 billion, and the negative impact can last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take “urgent measures” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones index for industrial companies, showed the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points - the largest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus, and the largest drop occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to undertake any travel.
As a consequence of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
A number of events involving large numbers of people, including annual New Year's festivals, have been cancelled by national and regional governments; private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events were cancelled and tourist attractions were closed in order to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were canceled.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended New Year’s holidays until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling the celebration of the New Year. The retail sector has suffered on a global scale: store opening hours have been reduced, and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centers fell by 33-43% compared to February.
The operators of shopping malls around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of equipment to check the temperature of visitors and the cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave 14-22 million more people out of poverty than it would be in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country’s provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought help from the government.
According to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the coronavirus outbreak can deprive 47 million people of jobs, and the unemployment rate can reach 32%. Self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed, receiving daily wages. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44% of Canadian households have suffered unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 workers have also lost their jobs in Spain since March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to a government-subsidized reduced work schedule - part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to society by ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed around the world indefinitely, or access to them had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or moved to other dates.
In return, active efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also experienced disruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian penitential period - Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while leaders of some churches offer open-air services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourds.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced Friday prayers were cancelled in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from accessing the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes to the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "postponed beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or canceled.
This has led many players to switch to online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all of their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in the creative professions continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There are many Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxious moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against representatives of the population of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Information reports for February (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for anything.
Some African countries are also seeing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition at an early stage, urging to prohibit the entry of Chinese citizens into their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag “Chinese Don’t ComeToJapan” took the lead on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, have reported rising levels of racist sentiment and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this view racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjar.
Students coming from China's bordering northeastern India and studying in major cities in India have reported cases of persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them".
Later, these statements received condemnation from the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called them a “misconception”. In China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against residents who are not Chinese citizens again broke out: foreigners began to be called “foreign garbage” and objects subject to “recycling”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have published their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in a hospital, or none at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By March 23, no country had been able to verify more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is very contradictory.
It is likely that such differences in data have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
With the help of polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on samples from the respiratory tract obtained in various ways, including a swab from the nasopharynx or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
An RT-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is only valid during the first week of illness.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, alternatively, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken with a suction catheter, or expectorant products (wet) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charité Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive approval from the National Drug Administration of China for the emergency use of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes through its International Reag Time organization
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only after that date that state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency authorization for use. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; sampling and processing of analyzes must be performed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "VEKTOR".
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of the test, which can be performed for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Application Authorization (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued a similar authorization to Holologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes, and negative ones in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Currently, a test is being developed in Taiwan using a monoclonal antibody that binds in a specific way to the nucleocapsidal protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 review of the specialized literature concluded that “breast X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
Typical signs detected during CT include bilateral multi-lobed subpleural sealing foci of the type of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone bridge symptom, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19." As of March 2020, it is the PCR method that the CDC recommends for initial screening.
Partially, the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct population control. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
A single peripheral blood sample is commonly used in CLT, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood sampling stage is not required to take an assay. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency approval test for use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permissions to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The testing performance is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore, this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: "Emergency department staff give the patient a test tube for the sample", the patient spits into it, gives back and after a while receives the results of the test. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient of other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance when it was used.
Rapid testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Physicians said it was willing to conduct about 12,000 tests a day on an outpatient basis, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany’s total test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of the calendar week of 12/2020 at SARS-CoV-2, a total of 2000 positive samples were processed in the area of at least 483,295 tests, up to the week of 12/2020, inclusive, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analysis.
Construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and accordingly, quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yang laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai - a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex schemes Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the shortage and insufficient number of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that involve heating the samples at 98C (208F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing that the United Arab Emirates is currently conducting per capita is higher than that of any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.
This was due to the rapid testing capabilities, along with the acquisition from Group 42 and BGI of a mass population testing laboratory (created on the basis of their Huo-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of tests of RT-PCR per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale, operating outside China.
Different testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers was not available until January 28, which led to a lack of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide a sufficient number of sets recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing opportunities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private US laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analyzes, were overloaded, and stocks of materials for taking swabs and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
American test kits developed by the CDC had "shortcomings", and for this reason, the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that the reason for the inaccurate results may be the unsuccessful sampling or improper use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall sets that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other sets — Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed to dump them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "did not use them". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020, it was announced that these kits were unsuitable for use.
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring people with whom such patients were in contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a person died of COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of people with a positive outcome had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were quarantined.
Entry into the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive tracking of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less severe than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on March 23 opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic thanks to intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions in them were less aggressive.
The statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the column “% positive results” indicators depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive percentage than a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of whether there are symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove contaminants, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
A person may also contract respiratory diseases, such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child going to the toilet.
After a cold, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic activities related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a small acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ARDs), provided appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, claiming the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after toilets, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out within the framework of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much hand washing can lead to itching and flaking of the skin — a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when hand washing with soap is important for reducing the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (wetting, defecation), after washing the baby’s buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before meals and before / after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases when you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or snoring, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is quite common.
A study on handwashing conducted in 2015 in 54 countries showed that on average for 38.7% of families handwashing with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the USA in this list is closer to the middle, their indicator is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China - 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing habits.
The “Emergency Care Program” implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen children’s health and improve the level of education of children.
This national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily cleaning of teeth with fluoride.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means for cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic contaminants, are poorly soluble in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, can also contain bacteria that can get on it during previous use.
A small number of studies devoted to getting bacteria on the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap, suggests a low probability of such a hit, as the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still states that "Liquid soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing."
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soaps, their effectiveness may not be consistent with that advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protection products, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, milky) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that in terms of preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the skin, we are usually so simple.
Hot water is comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
However, to remove natural fats that hold contamination and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer (hand sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers or sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing ease of use of these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacillus, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.999% - 99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to thoroughly process and soak the skin of the hands on both sides.
The front and back surfaces of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly washed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends opting for hand washing rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a substitute for full hand washing, if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and (or) other emollients to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants practically do not occur.
The lower probability of irritant contact dermatitis was a factor in favor of the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, products that do not contain water do not clean your hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as ordinary soaps and water, since pathogenic microorganisms are still left on the hands when using such means.
The effectiveness of a hand sanitizer that does not contain alcohol is largely dependent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been proven that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive side skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend the use of a handwashing technique that includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the water temperature just does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the area between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just water), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully rinse your hands under running water.
Rinsing your hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to contaminate. Most often, people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes done and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot pedal taps and other low-cost options.
A foot pedal crane is a simple design consisting of a capacity suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to allow water to flow on the hands; a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Napkins and Towels; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow air hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average increases by 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average decreases to 76%, and on the palms - up to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the toilet environment for each type of drying.
The air-jet dryer, which emits air at a declared speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms off the hands and from its own unit and potentially infect other users of the toilet and bathroom within a radius of 2 meters.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
When using paper towels, no significant spread of microorganisms was detected. In 2005, the company T?V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of drying hands.
There are the following changes in the number of bacteria, depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand cleaning using disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Hand sanitizer on an alcohol basis should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices, indeed, helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical handwashing lasts at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water, or gel used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying hands, closing the tap, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, you should use a paper towel.
This avoids re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and treatment procedure to be used in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public comment.
The corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
Commercial devices may be used to measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines “five moments” when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or bodily fluids,
before using an antiseptic, and
after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with a high content of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To "clean" hands before surgery requires a tap, which can be turned on and off without touching his hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water for rinsing hands, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, sterile brush for friction.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2-6 minutes.
No need to rub your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after the procedures of caring for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of handwashing benefits are greatest, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when handwashing frequency was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, hand washing with conventional soap leads to more than a threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing hand rubbing with an alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with an alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol hand solutions in terms of reducing the amount of H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Activities to develop hand hygiene in health facilities may include training personnel in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, as well as written and verbal reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
More research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to instill the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the results.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based health surveillance is effective to improve hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for handwashing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach approach: it promotes the implementation in schools of simple cost-effective measures that encourage the use of handwashing by students as well.
By enforcing minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
Handwashing is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emojis, symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (survival years without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating handwashing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution compared to other sanitation measures.
The importance of handwashing to human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene innovators: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English modern nurse and “founder”.
At the time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by putrefactive odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections associated with the provision of medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “the right hand washing techniques” were hung next to the washbasins in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing your hands” means expressing your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; this phrase subsequently found wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to clear herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she herself has committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act, tend to wash their hands more often compared to other people, and for them handcuffs are more important.
Also, it is less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing it will participate in any other “cleansing” compensatory activities, for example, in volunteer activities.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing especially.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
The control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the use of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and combat the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk management in the workplace depends on the place and job, based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and require basic infection control measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home with signs of illness, compliance with respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to become infected due to the ongoing spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example, in schools, a high-density work environment and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include air conditioning using high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical personnel and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk, with the risk increasing to very high levels when such personnel perform aerosol-assisted procedures or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as rooms with negative pressure ventilation, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
A COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may change both with respect to the types of goods for which there is demand and the ways of purchasing such goods (for example, making purchases in off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. When organizing protection, you can use the Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also specify the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to recommendations from the national or state level.
Some of the goals for the epidemic response are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to effectiveness.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19 disease, engineering and technical safety measures are most effective, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Safety engineering involves isolating employees from work-related risk areas and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action from an employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, fit the size (for example, respirators), used constantly and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that jobs with the least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic epidemic control measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory etiquette, including closing the mouth with the hand when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or replacement work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as cleaning.
Identifying and isolating individuals who are potentially infected is a critical step to protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the heat stops, no fever and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic drugs or other medication that eliminates the symptoms, and also prescribes flexibility for hospital leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, mid-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with the recent trips of such a person to the places of COVID-19 distribution.
Such categories include the provision of public relations tools, the provision of public relations tools, the provision of public relations tools, for example, in schools, work environment protection devices with high density devices and some large retail stores. Personal security tools for such groups and groups with higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protective screens, and the installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car.
In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, measures such as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person, providing the patient with a mask or asking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure the safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, regular cough, or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases with commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in case of illness, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical center on the ship in the presence of heat or other symptoms in someone on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies may be introduced, such as the abolition of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting the time of arrival and care, limiting insignificant visits, using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for prolonged absence from school can be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons diagnosed with or suspected of contracting COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as prescribed to emergency medical personnel, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
When close contact occurs during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before re-use with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of healthcare workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when performing procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting / processing samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sensing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or collection of samples by invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers include employees who treat the bodies of people with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such employees perform an autopsy, they move into a very high-risk category. Additional engineering safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including during procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be taken in accordance with the precautionary measures provided for the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to segregated waiting areas depending on the presence of suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with a confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved face respirators with an N95 filter or higher should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of workwear, since COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respiratory rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for personnel performing screening at the point of admission.
Persons collecting samples from the respiratory tract in patients with COVID-19 or vectors of this disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, bathrobe and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of availability of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protection through the use of remote medicine capabilities, physical barriers such as transparent windows, ensuring access to a COVID-19-infected patient only to those who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a specific task, prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, when working with several patients, the same monitoring of the same person.

AUTHORIZATIONS: CC0: No Protected Rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which is reflected in emails, calls and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.
It is with great gratitude and pride that I speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the performance of the sites, pay for our colleagues or protect the security of communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
In such a time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
According to our expectations, you will need to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before receiving subsequent orders.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, it is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether it’s taking care of your family, getting food, or going to a doctor’s appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and indisputable, but we mention it.
No sick leave or time off is required: just inform your supervisor and help the team review the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, let Brian know from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and proper attention from management to your situation.)
Payment of hourly rates will be made in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our commitment to our contractors and employees at an hourly rate.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can’t work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, this is about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “twice as hard to catch up” after the pandemic.
You do not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines, if possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations in terms of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thus allowing more time for budgeting, which will allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work will have a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council and update representatives and teams on next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces at the San Francisco office.
They used medical grade anti-virus solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules, prescribing caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is located in the network of WeWork, which shared with us and all personnel located in DC its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia went completely to remote work as directed in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them into a course of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out materials in advance for review.
By default, use video communication, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or joint notes).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact the technical support service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Connect to Slack’s ?remoties channel to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team examines ergonomics guides available in webinar format to promote efficiency of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons,” until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of conducting coordinated grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such goals.
In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only distress at the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief at the mutual understanding and the ability to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
In terms of perspectives, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on matters related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT to your calendar.
This time we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We are together in such a situation and are ready to help everything we can.
However, you can still receive information from such e-mails, and other important information on COVID-19 - from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We also work to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, problems with information coverage or if you need other help, please contact CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our commitments.
Quite the contrary: it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide opportunities to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the whole world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work to be done in the weeks and months ahead.
For this to happen, we will need help from each and every one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work as hard as you can when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as an entry point into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain of M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid colectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, its enzymatically active domain gets to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, splits the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-O).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnoop's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the protein S1 spike SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of protein S by the serine protease carrier TMPRSS2, an inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE and ARB inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.”
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with reduced mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with an overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovation in acute lung injury therapy and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure in 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options for contact tracking applications have been developed.
This has given rise to a debate about privacy issues, especially with respect to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Softer options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to register a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has partnered with Alipay to roll out an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has open source code and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the “StopKorona!” application, which works on Bluetooth, helps to track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking app is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications based on the Singaporean TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozoning function, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications in the App Store to include only “official” or other reliable organizations in this list.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for their state projects:
surveillance must be “lawful, necessary and proportionate”;
The extension of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by a limitation clause;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid aggravated discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties must be determined at the legislative level;
Protection from abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the issue of ongoing surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device’s operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, which eliminates the need to download the application and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have large potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers for communication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to alert citizens to potential contacts with infected persons, but also made the location information publicly available, which was made possible due to significant changes in data protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been made public.
Contact tracing, which preserves privacy, is an established concept with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on privacy-enhancing solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research presented in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Mainstreaming Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020, another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing technologies to ensure privacy, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of that data.
On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols founded the TCN global coalition, whose goal is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in the operation of its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the operation of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed would provide privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve privacy.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
deployment of tools to allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data privacy
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance, first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Drug repositioning (also known as repurposing, redirecting, altering tasks, or therapeutic repurposing drugs) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the one originally contemplated in development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP-ribophosphate.
Hussain AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is only permitted under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial regimens.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors say that they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is “unambiguously effective.”
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, a negative result was obtained after an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
A study was conducted in Wuhan, which monitored 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received favipiravir, and the second half - umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results indicating the effectiveness of the drug are scanty and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its stocks, and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe told the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in advanced cases of the disease.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
According to the results of one study, devoted to the combination of antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Kaletra), it was concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been revealed."
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community criticizes the conversion of drugs that were specially designed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against many phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by University of Cleveland clinics; one conducted on patients with a moderate form of the disease and the other on patients with a more severe form of it.
Three clinical trials are currently underway for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without the use of a placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in New York State.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, involved 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
For the study, called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding and not using effective contraception women can not participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompted the Italian Medicines Authority to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, a multicenter study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy, dedicated to the study of the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tested in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab-COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it does not expect that the vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research activities in its wake.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, iRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, a further 37 candidate vaccines have been claimed, but little publicly available information is available on them (presumably in the planning or development stage).
Stages I-II are pre-tested for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomised, placebo-controlled and at multiple sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Stage III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease and at the same time, side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in the preclinical studies phase).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the beginning of work on the development of their vaccine.
Janssen, together with its biotechnology partner Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used to vaccinate against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to develop the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which are located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had partnered with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported that they had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government expressed its protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is US$29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for vaccines on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank,” which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA administered subunit vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, eliciting strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined IBM’s supercomputer resources combined with those of cloud computing by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits besides disease prevention properties.
Another randomized trial, which is conducted in Australia, covers 4170 health workers.
Vaccines developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccine available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the study of SARS, which was conducted at that time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had undergone Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were under development, two adenovirus vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
A conspiracy theory circulated on social media claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that a vaccine for it already existed.
Social media posts quoted some patients who claimed to have patents for the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to the manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and multiorgan failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people have died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads through close human contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat by hitting the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at great distances.
People also become infected by touching the contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some departments recommend not using them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking, blue face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Less often, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat, can be observed.
Also, in different percentage ratios, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed.
Some cases reported in China were initially manifested only by a feeling of tightness in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than with normal volume speech.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that with an open cough, drops can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
The virus is generally not airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface, the virus is able to live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These figures, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents, when used correctly, have a quite useful effect in terms of combating infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can also eliminate it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar type II lung cells.
The virus combines with ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein - "spike" (peplomer).
12% of infected people admitted to a hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe form of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities, as they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in the ICU with COVID-19, and may indicate unfavorable forecasts. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL-6, and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also found during the autopsy.
The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by a swab from the nasopharynx, but a swab sample from the nose or sputum can also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not of immediate importance.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet become widespread.
The Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan University Hospital indicate methods for identifying infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobed subpleural condensation foci such as "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone bridge (lobular thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study performed during the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVS-syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a high-quality hygienic procedure for the hands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue facial masks in public places, in particular, to limit the transmission of infection by persons with asymptomatic disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and enterprises have been closed, the movement of citizens has been restricted and large public events have been canceled.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no proven efficacy drugs against COVID-19. Since the vaccine is expected to be completed no earlier than 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "going to the plateau".
The CDC also recommends washing your hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand pollution, as well as before eating and after sniffing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand sanitizer (alcohol content of at least 60%), but only in cases where soap and water are not available. WHO provides two formulations for local production to regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, it is recommended to observe the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures in which airborne droplets can occur, such as intubation or drying of the hands, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical institutions.
Health care workers caring for people with COVID-19 are advised by the CDC to be placed in an air-dropped insulator (AIR), an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in terms of contact and air. The CDC has published recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective bathrobe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above tools, it is preferable to use respirators, not medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used outside the instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, in extreme cases, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of the COVID-19 current are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases when it turns out to be necessary.
A type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently under active study, with some evidence suggesting that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective as ventilator for critically ill patients.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for the elderly (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds per capita are scarce, and health system resources are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in COVID-19 infections in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
According to one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial ventilation is becoming more complicated, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops in COVID-19, and oxygenation entail more and more problems.
Inhalation pressure ventilators and DCVs are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage by ventilation, which can lead to the development of pneumothorax.
On earlier fan models, a high PDC may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
The development of new drugs can last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in testing the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is at serious or immediate risk.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical studies, which should be carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “close contact” using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is found, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence — such tools are used to track infected people and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave permission to security authorities to track the data of mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallera, Italy’s regional health commissioner, said mobile network operators report that “40 percent of people are still moving around.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can occur in mild form with few or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with mild forms of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while it may take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although no such COVID-19 data are available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In those with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and problems with the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clot abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while renal impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, and among women - 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
In pneumocytes, viral cytopathic changes were observed.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart problems were associated with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary by condition due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective counting of cases in mild form can lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that some patients who recovered from the disease, lung volume decreased by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After intensive care” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovered from the virus developed persistent immunity against it.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported when, after recovering from COVID-19, coronavirus tests still turned out to be positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an aggravated protracted course of the disease, and not re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its human-to-human transmission.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date for the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by the WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of disease spread, and are also influenced by testing volumes, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 - for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/240,191).
Some other methods include determining the rate of death due to disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who die as a result of the disease, and determining the rate of death due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who die as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have undergone infection, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected by the presence of such antibodies.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the indicators of donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The most at-risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, co-morbidities in men (e.g., hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) may be responsible for higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, so they are more likely to get infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of the WHO, Mr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explains: “CO” means “crown”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public messages, WHO additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19".
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Uhank Coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.
Due to the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as swabs to take swabs from the nose, as well as parts of ventilators.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it in the required time, then one of the local productions was repurposed and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread rapidly on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine against the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the Solidarity Trial, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
The vaccine does not yet exist, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous research conducted on SARS-CoV are used in scientific research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, the researchers aim to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-chipped protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-telosavirus enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of these studies were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposing antiviral drugs makes up the majority of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. To the same end, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir, as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires priming of the spike protein with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have severe limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further investigation. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia can occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug has entered the 2nd stage of a non-randomized test, which is carried out nationally in Italy, after positive results of its use in patients with a severe form of the disease were obtained.
Combined with a blood serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract such factors that are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now considered a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results were inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms may be used, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of convalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.
