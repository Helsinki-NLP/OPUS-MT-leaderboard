In Kineshma and the district two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1-00, in the village of Lugovoye at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile traveled by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system, undertaken by Washington and state planning authorities.
The usually boring motorway planning arena has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive, and even perhaps where you drive them, and then use that information when compiling tax bills.
The tea party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding privacy.
And although Congress cannot yet agree on whether to proceed or not, several states are not going to wait.
Over the next decade, they are pondering how to move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It’s not a matter on which we may have a choice,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state’s miles traveled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay those taxes.
The technology for that already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government's Highway Construction Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn’t been raised in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
“A gasoline tax simply can’t be saved,” said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the system of erroneous payment.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Boring people call this the wrong user fee.
Unsurprisingly, the idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes could change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning authorities in California are eyeing the system as they develop strategies to meet targets set by that state’s ambitious global warming laws.
However, Rep. Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that’s going to go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move in the direction of mispayment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
House leaders, however, rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel miles to get to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are following this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles of mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is under consideration in New York.
Illinois will trial it on a limited basis involving trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently fitted with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
“Worrying about big brother and things like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states that are struggling to find a low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep records of driving miles, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of a type of auto insurance in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it’s testing attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded using a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may abandon the device altogether, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles that all state residents drive.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are keen to develop a tax-deductible device that will also accept payment by parking meters, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“The motorists will be attracted to participate in the benefits that will be offered to them”, — stated in the document of urban design.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all the talk of mispayment is just a huge distraction.
Officials at the city’s San Francisco Bay Area Transportation Commission say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to make them pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Stand-by talks are under way with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the talks added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of financing.
Nor does the international rating agency S&P, which downgraded Ukraine’s sovereign rating on Friday to B- from B-, believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get help.
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support for the country, the EU has a backup option for providing Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of whose supplies are now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse gas from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can be used only for several weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Negotiations are underway between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where a strict quota of growth in the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, which are allowed to enter only cars with a certain eco-class, using also high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunsheng, Director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% in fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city measures of the “green five-year plan” include an accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuel, restrictions on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs for replacing old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public high-speed transport.
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars moving within the fifth transport ring (there are six of them in the capital of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011, mobile sources accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the HSE Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are obviously unpopular, they can be adopted by society only if they are completely universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - official and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice less than required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the territory of the historic center’s security zone (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will grow significantly
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous tents and trays.
Most street vendors don’t pay taxes, and the products they sell often don’t pass proper sanitary controls.
And this means that the health of moisture is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive cuts in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the pattern of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not slow down,” said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Currently, nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will engage in optimization of personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies are facing a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and increased unemployment.
Russian business cannot not raise wages, comments Vladimir Pantyushin, chief economist for Russia and the CIS at Barclays Capital.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
To lure employees away or keep the current ones, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid growth in consumer lending.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the country's economy.
"We did not see any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, money does not diverge in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in overdue unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned,” said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
Director of the HSE Banking Institute Vasily Solodkov is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, without access to cheap resources, such as those of state-owned banks, were forced to attract funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, the state-owned banks took the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state-owned banks do not abandon dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
Deprivation of the licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a harbinger of a mass collapse.
"State banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investment does not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the certificate), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is sure.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil,” he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink at oil prices below $ 90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting,” said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, affects only interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,” Clemens Grafe estimated.
Money received at auctions of the Central Bank, banks are used not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, this means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,” said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the state plans to put the ruble into “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he said.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially inflated by 10%.
Ruble only one way - to weaken, - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank casts a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
Here we can set an example not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences and disagreements.
We live in full understanding,” says Theophanes, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
Following the meeting, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued at the Opera and Ballet Theatre.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden ready to ‘collaborate’ with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
Charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr Stroebele, a member of parliament from Germany’s Green Party, posted his photo with Mr Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Stroebele said that according to the lawyer of a former NSA contractor, Mr Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
Had Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there “safe,” the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in a letter that he faced a “tough and persistent” harassment campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world’s reaction to “his political remarks.”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials — including in the United States — have found exposing an unchecked system of pervasive surveillance beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board its flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers only pay when they are at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for that,” she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags checked into their luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges stuff as much as they can in hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why there is often not enough space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit of the Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change to procedures on the website and at Frontier's check-in counters is designed to ensure passengers will be aware of the fee before they get to the boarding gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage charge won't start until summer, though the date has yet to be set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage charge three years ago, and another discounter, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that a hand luggage fee earns Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew a Spirit flight and was wondering what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers faced an unusual Spirit hand luggage charge.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a gnashing of teeth and a fight at the exit of the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing was quick.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire jar and that coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months later, after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers don’t buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began giving half as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the miles traveled.
So, a trip of 1000 miles with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight capacity declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA Blames ‘Internal Mistake’ Not Hackers for Shutting Down Website
The National Security Agency, shrouded in secrecy, said Friday night that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA official told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network “wasn’t” hacked.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hacker activists said it was responsible for disabling the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
Hackers’ tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system’s internal network.
The previously top-secret NSA, once nicknamed “No Such Agency,” has been the focus of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically — all in reaction to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by a disillusioned former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier's profit declines with falling deliveries and aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, said on Thursday it had reduced net profit by 15 percent due to a decline in orders and deliveries in the third quarter and problems with contracts at its rail division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any data on flight tests of its newest aircraft CSeries and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans will be fulfilled to put the aircraft into commercial operation by next September.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results did not justify the forecasts and led to a drop in shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, downgraded his valuation from “above the market average” to “average” on Thursday because of a belief that stock growth is limited in the coming quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transport department’s profit margins,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are still not too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to check the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and media outlets that the program was moving ahead as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the downtime of the aircraft.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to conduct the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and everyone else will follow shortly, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the commissioning date and will provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - though apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and general market conditions were an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
Gross aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $ 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure of December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichett will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 at auction in mid-Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony, ending the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced its forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s July-September 2013 results were more disappointing than expected, driven by a drop in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s TV business, which generated its first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years in the second quarter, again fell to 9.3 billion yen in operating losses in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through hard times, especially due to the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors seek to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure will be significantly higher and will be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of “smart” watches from the Japanese corporation was announced, endowed with a number of fashionable functions that will eliminate the need to get a smartphone 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% in the morning at the opening of the torogs in Tokyo, dropping to the level of 1668 yen per share.
The gene of speech was a stimulant for the formation of synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that makes Foxp2’s speech gene function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
It was possible to establish his role in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce the words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have been disrupted by the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function, it remained unknown.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with the formation of speech.
He does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, while Foxp2 only affects its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists have confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animals’ gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of sounds was also restored.
Previously, the mice also showed a connection to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals injected with a human copy of the gene cried more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists don’t know whether Foxp2’s work and, accordingly, the SRPX2 it controls is related to purely “mechanical” properties of sound formation or finer processes.
Lawyer with cocaine addiction, who warned the leader of the criminal group about the police investigation, is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Liverpool Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information about the investigation of his activities on drug trafficking after he was threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed a "cool lawyer" among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented at a drug court.
Officers noticed the 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three bags of cocaine outside a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a lawyers' association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditt “regularly used” a Class A drug, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of an extensive investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other people were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million euros in a series of raids, as well as more than 200,000 euros in cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, Ditt, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was covered with shame after pleading guilty to two counts of intentionally obstructing justice at the end of a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer's exposure came after police investigating Scarborough found that he had spoken to Ditt on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent pure black golf glove drugs under the lawyer's trash cans.
Soon after the transfer Scarborough repeatedly called with Ditt, who was at a dinner at the football stadium Ewood Park team "Blackburn Rovers".
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditt was “regularly using” cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted an "advocacy secret".
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, he also had a sample of hair taken.
When questioned by the police, he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office, and clients came to his house for legal affairs.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of which he previously represented in court to tell what detectives know about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said, “If anyone knows that you shouldn’t break the law, it’s a criminal defense attorney.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove to be legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He got too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed his disinterest to be questioned.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and stated, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass the information on to Mr Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main targets of criminal gangs, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Ditt was led by the Lancashire Serious Organized Crime Unit, which has already been sentenced to three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to achieving fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditt organized a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing death row clients in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, said police officers who were present today at the meeting of the RFU FCC.
The ticket program is overstated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved with the regular norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans had 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
These data were announced by the head of the KDC Artur Grigoryants.
Americans eavesdropping on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of the American intelligence services, who chose not to disclose his name, said that the United States was eavesdropping on the telephone conversations of high-ranking officials in Japan.
This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, as well as Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK TV channel reported.
Officially, neither side has yet commented on this information.
We will remind, the news about the surveillance of the U.S. intelligence services for the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
According to some reports, the chancellor herself took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel with employees of the German prosecutor’s office.
The German flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria may put grain up for auction not earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain up for auction not earlier than the beginning of 2014, said the Minister of agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, there is a demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that this year crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were sown for the harvest of 2014 (by 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The areas for winter wheat and triticale have been increased, the rye has remained at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group “Brotherly circle”, to which Leps was ranked in the United States
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the group "Brother's Circle", to which Washington ranked the singer Grigory Leps, is not listed.
As noted by “Interfax” in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reports about the inclusion of the U.S. Treasury Department Grigory Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brother’s Circle”, all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the very name - 'Brother's Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret bed.
"All this is very similar to a PR action," the agency's interlocutor said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was listed on its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brotherly Circle” Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
Persons on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
In the production center Grigory Leps refused to comment on the accusations of the United States against the singer, calling them “delusion”.
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama listed the Brotherhood syndicate as a “significant transnational organized criminal group” and instructed the Treasury Department to “undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations.”
The inclusion of a person in the black lists of the American Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons living in the States.
Scandalous video goes to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
The police of the Canadian city said that it has the appropriate video and is ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said that his post will not leave, reports CNN.
The information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies Bill Blair held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said that he is not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but he vouchs for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor has no comment on this.
He only says that he is not guilty of anything and he is not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford’s 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisi served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.

Turkish politician on hunger strike against border wall with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began construction of a separation wall near the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, located on the border with Syria, Ayshe Gekhan, went on a hunger strike protesting the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) reported on Friday.
Police have repeatedly broken up protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Guler first denied the construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
“The mayor of Nusaybina, Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, went on a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle,” the party’s press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds have been crossing this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree to,” Aisha Gekhan of the party said.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, the Bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by Bloomberg with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the Bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the Agency, Caracas may still decide to reduce the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of price containment for products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Ugra Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation occurred just a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I’m not ready.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and will achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan Press Outraged by Provocative Media Law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent the destruction by Parliament of the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, CapitalFM’s parent company, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media court would "always be biased as it is a continuation of the government" and that content and advertising restrictions would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take the media with a stranglehold,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “got a serious blow,” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media has angered authorities by streaming surveillance footage of troops being sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimayo's reaction was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists - up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", that is, to get a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.”
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “revitalized blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of restraining and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians left to themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal cuts appointed by the National Wages Commission and reinstate their massive 532,000-shillings-per-month tax-free salary, one of the highest in the world.
In the communal payments of Voronezh residents will be a new line of expenses - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order the stairwells or even replace the elevator - it will be decided by the residents themselves.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to restore order - to establish the order of capital repairs of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register either in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds collected by residents for the repair of apartment buildings."
Now under the control of the state and share construction.
The law protecting against fraudsters is approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people suffered from unfair developers.
The majority’s problems were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes the rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It's no secret that abuses have also begun in this area, due to the fact that in the 98th year the shareholders were the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People began to earn money to cover the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under pressure from the federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region at least a little.
So, last year, a little more than 100 thousand foreigners entered the migration register.
However, only one in five people has an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: “They violated the law, but they are not criminals.”
There is no court, and they must be deported - they must be kept somewhere.
This decision was made by the Federation, which at the expense of regional funds to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
Finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families raising 5 or more children are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same is saved by parents with many children.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
Family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, native child and 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state acquires housing area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can already buy a whole cottage.

U.S. Secretary of state: intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and wiretapping, American intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far”, but the politician noted that the information about the wiretapping of 70 million people appeared in the media is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in the process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases this has gone too far and has been inappropriate.
“I recognize that, as the president acknowledges, and we will make sure that doesn’t happen in the future,” he said.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Published on Wednesday, data showed that 12.5% of the country's residents are now unemployed.
Things have not been so bad since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the country’s largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for employees with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for the problem of an aging population common to Europe.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
What will the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and interchange hubs (TPU).
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
What actually turns out to be the project, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the metro station "Smolenskaya" of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the arrangement of the transport and transfer hub was underway.
All this was very strange, because next to the "Smolenskaya" no ground transport does not stop and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including a land crossing through Karmanitsky lane.
Now the "Smolensk" is almost over.
The flower stall has disappeared, the stand for newspapers has been dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced with paving stones.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and interchange units are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital Department of transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flats involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, flat TPU is not even engaged in transport workers, and professional landscapers from the Department of capital repairs of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, - explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over your head and a scoreboard, notifying you about the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the Yasenevo metro station recently opened a fully-fledged flat interchange hub.
Let no canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and placards indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials record in the TPU anything that does not fall.
Back in 2011, the city hall planned to build all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now the plans for 2020 include as many as 255 TPU.
One and a half of them promise to give up again this year.
Although the city has a TPU development program, no quality criteria are indicated, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
Reported by the number of objects, but the quality of transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: first, a reduction in transplant time, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, the arrangement of TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the street of the Cosmonauts.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
For nothing, the residents did not want a bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow immediately failed.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the metro "Planernaya".
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be a sample of how the transfer node, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are bus ramps, a canopy not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of car parks.
However, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU were not given a place in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
There are more places to trade.
Only clothes 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.
Well, in fact, what kind of bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason, we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to give under the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor of the Parking spaces there is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and security guards looking maliciously at our photographer.
The transfer hub has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, merchants were sorry and allowed to intercept the parking of the interchange hub.
Due to high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's the castling.
At the metro station "Kaluzhskaya" the distance of the approach from the lobby of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass it under the open sky.
However, the designs on the "Planer" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the Town Planning and Land Commission of the City Hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow at the metro station "Tushino", it will have 418.7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the management of railway stations of Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told reporters: in future high-rise buildings there will be shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials claim that multi-storey parking lots are a mutt from a third to half of the area.
Let's take the example of "people's" garages.
For example, a garage with 258 parking spaces, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars, Petrovsko-Razumovskaya will need about 80 thousand "squares".
That’s less than a third of what they’re going to build.
Let one or two floors go to all kinds of platforms for buses.
There are at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPU at the stations and railway stations are built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metro residents.
They also promised that there will be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the property department of the city of Moscow recently told reporters that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for a site for TPU to officials directly.
No contests.
Because, they say, transport issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without going outside.
There is no excess trade around.
But Moscow officials throw to extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will turn off 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate extremism with insulting patriotic feelings
In order to legally protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Just Russia proposes to equate the insulting of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper “Izvestia”, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to obtain an opinion in the Supreme court and the government.
By patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with a country of which he is a citizen, characterized by a love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the MP, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions unfolding annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds annually.
Exercising in wit and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the conclusion that, they say, it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation," Oleg Mikheev is outraged.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and you can insult patriotic feelings with almost impunity.
According to him, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to prescribe the corresponding punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000th fine to a five-year sentence.
Earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
No casualties or damage caused by tremors have yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying strength are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, in Chile there was the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960 there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of the disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday announced that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can have no doubt that the case will be conducted in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like the rest of the activists, is charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen,” Mr. Ero was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the law,” Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects “like a powder keg”, and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico.
United Nations Announces New Goals to Overcome Poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told summit participants last night that now is the time to “stand above national interests.”
“I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals — the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing due to the conflict of influential people
Beneath a top-down statue of Zamora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
There have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo for two weeks, one of the most violent clashes since the armistice more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a prominent rebel movement that was supported first by the white Rhodesian authorities and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party accuse each other of creating tensions.
Renamo's party says the government has been behind the latest clashes, attacking its members in Sofala province, Renamo's traditional stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a Renamo spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebuza tried to allay fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "everything left of his strength to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
However, fears rose after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) facing off with their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo’s party, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to secure concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to step down next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and swift attacks on police stations and cars on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo’s party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and they have to find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultouan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
Series of premiere film screenings "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of film screenings "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Rolan" from 1 to 5 November, RIA "Novosti" with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program “Art-mainstream” will open the French comedy of the director and actress Reim Kerichi “Paris at any cost”.
This is the story of Maia (Kerici herself), a model working in the French capital, who is deported to Morocco due to problems with her visa.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also show the audience a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk “Mebius”, the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirschbigel “Diana: a love story” (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the title role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival “Life of Adele” by Abdeltif Kesha.
The only Russian participant of the "Art-mainstream" will be the film of Alexander Veledinsky "Geographer of the globe" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - charming loser-teacher Victor Service - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavr".
Children should learn myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
Tales of the Torah could show that "brute power cannot defeat subtle cunning", and legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will turn out to be "too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught in schools", Crossley-Holland advocates a "thorough selection" of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favor of introducing them to the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralizing” of authors and teachers “removes the interest” of children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote a Collection of Norse Myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there is an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station of the Dirty-Voronezh transport police removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of their favorite team, the guys on the way made a drunken debacle on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty part of the line police station at the station Mud to draw up a report on an administrative offense.
There, the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police issued administrative materials and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for its arrival.
At half past midnight, the fans left the train station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the front door window in the waiting room of the station.
On the ringing of the broken glass rushed the transport police officer and security guard of the private enterprise "RZD".
They managed to apprehend the attacker who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are being checked.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is rife, said the senior referent of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
I think we're 15 years back.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am in favor of the organizers of sports events being responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFU.
But we can see that they have taken a different position.
They are waiting for someone from the outside to come and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let things go on their own.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it’s done, we’ll get to grips with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state, they say, give the law quickly.
It seems that it is the fans of “Bavaria” in Yaroslavl came and arranged all this.
We are outside observers.
And it's terrible to see a stand being watered from a firewall.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I have a feeling that we are 10-15 years back,” said Mutko.
Snowden could be questioned in Russia
Former US intelligence official Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify in cases of wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As told “Interfax” on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer the questions of representatives of the Prosecutor General’s office of Germany in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is practically excluded.
“In this case, he will lose refugee status and can be issued to Washington by US allies,” the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to Russia or send written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, a member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by American special services of the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The former CIA officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, to do this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival,” Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of "Interfax", said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide for themselves.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information about secret US intelligence operations on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who charged him in absentia, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in “a large Russian company”.
The NSA’s surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by German media last week.
According to journalists, the telephone conversations of the Chancellor, the Americans began to listen in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of this information said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left “Fair Russia”
The deputy of the State Duma from the party “Fair Russia”, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted a statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the “righteous Russians”.
We're sitting here, drinking tea...
“For some reason, many people want to see the picture “Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table,” but there is nothing so epochal about it,” the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the SRs.
Meanwhile, from the mandate of the Deputy of the state Duma Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law cannot leave it.
Reports about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party “Fair Russia” appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave the "SR" with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and bilateral in nature.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, RIA Novosti writes.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia involves resolving the issue of the disputed Northern territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding the return of the lands lost after the Second World War.
In the Japanese capital, cars drive, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
We can safely say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, entertainer Frank Fay, who worked as a entertainer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hersh, the founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolinas and then got more success, reached a level where they were already too famous to play at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as Standup for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example, thanks to shows on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame thanks to his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (intentionally a scrappy "League" on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now conducts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast in both “Saturday Night Live” and “Parks and Recreation”, although she is best known for the series of viral videos “Marseille is a seashell in shoes”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, crafty, focused on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview between David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the centerpiece of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he would sometimes walk down a street between two houses and think, “If I’m left with no money at all, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of this country in the UK, where Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of relations between Pakistan and India, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister said a dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani embassy said in a statement.
“He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with Pakistan’s constitution,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are trying to create an Islamic state.
The Islamabad government has previously attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement has refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would negotiate only if the authorities moved troops stationed in Taliban-held areas to their permanent locations and released jailed Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over the formation of large inventories eclipsed a report showing China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark grade of US oil in December fell by 14 cents, and its price was $ 96.24 per barrel later in the morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
The rich oil reserves have affected its price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. inventories have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after its third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil — the benchmark grade of international oil, also used by US refineries — fell by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Head coach of “Colorado” Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goaltender Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday’s match with “Dallas”, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sokor “SE” Natalia Shmelev.
What are we waiting for," said Rua after the morning rollout of "Lavine."
Of course, what happened bothers us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the condition of the goalkeeper?
We'll see today.
There is no doubt that our players will support Varley by helping him keep the goal, as they did in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, you should not be vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, found out the correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not endure the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate for them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil with liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict standards in nutrition, at least, is not useful for health.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for vegetable ones.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs, "- said nutritionist Marina Bohai.
She cites the example of a fish containing the essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the necessary quantities for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors believe that the inhabitants of Siberia, special attention should be paid to the diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly challenged during this season.
In the context of our realities, high demands are placed on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
“If a person limits himself to animal products, respectively, he lacks this caloric content,” says the specialist.
I agree with this nutritionist Olga Poznyak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set up for better assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people do not want to gnaw cucumber, but a hot soup or something more filling,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this, of course, is not enough for proper nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have a sufficient level of vitamins only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and snow lies in May, is impractical.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat, ”the doctor states.
Doctors say that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegans don’t get them,” God forbid.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play those toys that he wants."
He has an already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
The children must eat well.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones tomorrow will not recover,” she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree on the low quality of vegetables and fruits grown in winter greenhouses and imported.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of the products is not the same,” God says.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more is detrimental to quality.
“Apples do not turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and odorless,” the doctor said, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizers.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This does not agree with the head laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to expel more from a square meter, then, of course, watering will become more frequent, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,” she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in the New York police Department
On Thursday, a federal district appeals court suspended enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's "stop-and-search" program, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the execution of Judge Sheera Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it carried out a program of street detentions and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and rulings on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police station change work practices and the associated training program.
On Thursday, the court of appeal heard the debate of the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The appeals court said the judge needed to be challenged because she violated the U.S. judges' code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid demonstrating bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Hispanics on a “stop-and-search” program.
She appointed an external supervisor to oversee the sweeping changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York City decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city's appeal debate is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Stop-searching has been practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of the “stop-and-search” changes at the New York Police Department say the changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more robust and effective police service, and could impact how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, not crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to a decrease in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of “stop-and-search” that is consistent with the Constitution, but changes the way the New York police stop people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to Bolotnaya Square.
Street floor lamps, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets have been installed throughout, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky Lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordynsky dead end, the Big and Small Tolmachevsky Lanes, the Kadashevskaya Embankment and Bolotnaya Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseyka and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klymentovsky lane conditions for pedestrians created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of the Holy Martyr Clement the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver passage, Stoleshnikov lane and Kuznetsky Most street became completely pedestrian.
Big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to hacking the phone to check a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who was then the Minister of internal Affairs.
The prosecutor, Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, the News of the World newspaper received false news that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcair to hack into Polby’s voicemail and waited for her outside the house to interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand outside someone’s home hoping to take someone by surprise, he is the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they will say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate the stories: hacking phones, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah!"
Rumors about Clark's novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A cassette of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcair’s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator’s computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects.”
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap controlled the surveillance of Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr. Blankett over an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with other people to break into their phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Turlbeck and Uezerap confessed to hacking the phones.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to the German authorities in the case of wiretapping
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by a member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden conveyed a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden in Moscow yesterday.
As a result of the fire on Tver street injured four people
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, citing a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, injured passers-by who were at the time of the fire in the smoke underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the capital Department of fuel and energy economy Pavel Livinsky, currently in all houses on Tverskaya street fully restored electricity.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
Heavy smoke came from the storm sewer hatches, and smoke formed in the underground passage located near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were de-energized.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. cuts food allowance for poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food stamps, known as “food stamps”, is reduced, since the corresponding state program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be $36 less per month than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012, the allowance per person was an average of 133 dollars per month.
Food aid spending in the U.S. has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Roughly 14% of Americans rely on free food aid given at “food rates” that have been given that name since the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food store owners across America worry that cuts will lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard Releases 19-Year-Old Platformer for Free
Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for free on PC.
It is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available in Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is also not yet available.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is not externally different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack for Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and light kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vloros Kyle, who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was formerly known as Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
In the Moscow metro there will be new machines.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of squats will count a special device with the help of modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first unit will be installed at the station "Exhibition" on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket athletes will host the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
National Security Agency confessions heighten corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the internal intelligence service of Germany, his task was to photograph the roof of the building of the U.S. Mission, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV was hoping to detect the antennas of the eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to talks between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. does not use foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee turned whistleblower, began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The final straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it’s likely that these data are being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Gruen, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the U.S. has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business people are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
And yet, the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies, made known by Snowden’s revelations, came as a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European CEOs have become more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-US participants abandoned plans to use the services of a US-based cloud provider after exposing the US program for Prism data mining.
Jim Snape, one of SAP’s chief executive officers, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, and we spy on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies, the idea has long been internalized that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, at least, imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it’s been standard practice for years to assemble mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, employees, and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV report warns.
The U.S. warns its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. national intelligence report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of violators who are hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarcini, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died by “ridiculous accident”, believe that their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside a curled-up sports mat in his high school gym, believe their son was killed, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 in a upright mat tucked behind the stands in his high school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's Department investigators have concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, however, the family of a 17-year-old teenager disputes this.
“They absolutely believe their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says he did.
“They think it contradicts logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy revealed that Johnson had died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
However, a second autopsy, Moore said, revealed a different cause of death.
“There are several issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to warrant a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance footage that investigators viewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the videos contained clues to how he died.
"Spartak": For information about persons who hung fascist symbols
On the official website of “Spartacus” appeared the statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance on the podium in Yaroslavl of the fascist flag.
"At the cup match" Shinnik "-" Spartak "on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbols.
We appeal to all who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offense, with a request to provide it.
“Remuneration is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who posted a fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" several times interrupted due to riots in the stands.
Fascist symbols were also demonstrated on the Spartak fans' sector.
In the form of punishment, Spartak can hold about three matches without spectators.
There will be a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and posted this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the US government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep a supply of adrenaline — most commonly an EpiPen automatic medical syringe is used for injections — to assist with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline supplies with less difficulty.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have experienced an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something’s sticking into my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “The tongue is pinching.”
Parents of Intersex Children May Choose ‘Unspecified Sex’
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate-type external genitalia.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “unspecified” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about sex assignment surgery to newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m neither male nor female.”
I will remain a doctor-made patchwork piece with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorders" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the US say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it than to wait and track the child’s psychological and physical development before the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require prompt intervention, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then see how personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, and is typical for both at the same time or is not typical for either of them.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and physique; primary sex characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender differences now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world recognized as “asexual”, defending in court the right to maintain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Interior Ministry, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning over two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer the babies to be set gender at birth.
“Raising a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, after a beautiful Greek god who possessed features of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything and then draw again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the assigned sex when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case,’” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist - you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily amenable to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental cues, including social cues — how parents raise a child — interact with a child’s genes and hormones to determine whether a person will consider themselves male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories came into question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the careless circumcision, to completely castrate the child, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex reassignment surgeries declared themselves to be “unhappy with the outcome.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but genitals of an intermediate type.
Doctors could not determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external penis and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone injections and removing his chest.
The operation made him sterile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersex.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law "encourages labeling and stigma."
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an ‘undetermined gender,’” she said.
We are afraid that he will facilitate the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
German law requires it to be appropriated at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not engage in at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "complete androgen insensitivity syndrome."
Because her androgen receptors are malfunctioning, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is undergoing residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Barac said.
He gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows kids to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with, and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six goals from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed goal.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I did not succeed, - leads CSNChicago words Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably should approach them as games, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a bit.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss that many pucks.
It’s great that my teammates support me, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to play a lot better.
But what happened is what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I’ll just try to play the next game better.
In the Altai turned over the bus.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory, a PAZ bus overturned.
As a result of the accident, according to updated data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 am local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vishnevka road, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all of whom received injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, two people were hospitalized in Rubtsovsk.
Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
“We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type,” Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that after this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will one day be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister said.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk region began a unique program to save ... storks nests
In the old days, to bring storks to the court, the peasants on a high pole installed a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so storks have chosen poles of power lines - intertwined branches rely on wires, thanks to which the stork house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikov district for twenty years lives a stork family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the lower layer has already settled between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, pity the family of storks, who every year nested at the farmhouse, brought out and nursed over the summer three or four chicks, but I do not want to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm lands, Anna's grandmother called the Tsarichansky DEN, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still holds, - said Sergey Berezovsky, technical director of DTEK Dniprooblenergo.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, the birds could die from an electric discharge.
And the locals risked being left without electricity due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear monters began the operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there are more than 50 "apartments" in emergency condition in the region.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was braided with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then they will build their own homes.
A month ago in the village of Peschanka Novomoskovsk district was reconstructed the first nest.
Next to the electrical support, a new reinforced concrete pillar was installed and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikov district, on the outskirts of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “apartment” has undergone major repairs.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected by four more nests in Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
Recently, the whole region flew sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers for fun shot the swan family that lived on the local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now the staff of the Apostolovsky district police Department to find out who shot at the birds listed in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is becoming more popular
November 4, on the Day of National Unity, in Moscow will be agreed with the mayor's office "Russian March".
According to a survey by the Levada Center, support for the Russian Marches is growing - already 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the idea of holding them.
According to the “Levada-center”, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the “Russian marches”: 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% are “rather positive”.
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006, only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010 the holding of such events was already supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to "Russian marches" are only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow mayor's office agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15 thousand people in Lublin, said today the head of the security Department of the capital Alexei Mayorov.
This nationalist action has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
When asked by sociologists "Have you heard about the fact that on November 4 in Russia "Russian Marches" are held under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?", three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Now only one in five Russians knows about this action (20%).
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the “Russian Marches”.
Recall that three years ago on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place on Manezhnaya Square, which turned into mass riots.
“Levada-center” also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
Over the past two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens gather to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same (17%) intend to celebrate November 7 the Day of the October Revolution.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow mayor’s office agreed on the “Russian March” in Lublin
On October 28, Moscow authorities agreed to hold the “Russian March” on November 4 in Lublin.
This was announced by the leader of the association "Russians", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, a rally and a rock concert of the group "Kolovrat", also agreed with the authorities, will be held.
How did the "Russian March 2012"
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from Yakimanskaya embankment to the Central House of Artists, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6 thousand.
Previous Post:Obama’s campaign considered the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Hylemann about the 2012 campaign “Bets Doubled: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president’s closest aides conducted “large-scale focus group research and opinion polls in late 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise fading hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of senior officials of the campaign and the White house, namely the former head of the White house Bill Daly, to assess the effect of the appointment of former Secretary of state Clinton Vice President.
The possible replacement was a closely guarded secret at the Chicago campaign headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book, Bets Doubled, claims Daley was behind the effort to replace Biden despite their “close personal relationship,” but ultimately backed out when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral roll would not “improve substantially Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daly confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I was very vocal about a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
Although Daley described the study as "a necessary test," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested heavily in examining whether the move would pay dividends on the vote.
“The campaign doesn’t spend that much money on polls and focus groups if they don’t take things seriously,” Martin said on the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daly if his then-boss knew about the possible shuffling.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former chief of staff admitted that “maybe” Obama knew.
Martin added that “The stakes are doubled” does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political probing reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was unaware of the study's possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want ice cream in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first dark-colored ice cream with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, increasing the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lease Me, I'm Delicious, says: "It's an incredible thing, but it's still in its early stages when it comes to production, so for about 200 euros you'll get about 2 grams of the substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will begin to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the last few months and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me about ?140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold leaf.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to make invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the KHL regular season match against Salavat, noted that the Omsk team conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from Magnitogorsk Metallurg.
The specialist stressed that Avangard needs to pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkin.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
Missed due to their mistakes, due to failure to complete the game task.
We knew the rival had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three goals scored us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparing for today's game?
The guys and I carefully analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was played and the score was 2-0.
Missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to be mistaken.
Given how difficult the game was, there was no point in connecting the defenders.
Defending the whole team.
Now "Avangard" has a long home series, the matches are held every other day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of your moments and the execution of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is solved not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have queued on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Donetsk officials have promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install toilets
At the border points at the entrance to Russia accumulated hundreds of trucks.
This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy head of Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the convention on international transportation.
The checkpoints are working in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent of "FACTS" visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as well as the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk-Voznesenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transport destinations from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here, cargoes are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, they were still allowed, and after they introduced these rules, - complains truck driver Alexei Golovanov (pictured), who is carrying cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan in transit through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
According to the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has such a lot of money with him!
Imagine, if the driver is carrying a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival at the border - no, - complain truckers, arranged to eat near their cars.
In the border shops and cafes are always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers orientated and quickly inflated them: 15 hryvnia is a baton, seven hryvnia is a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia is a plate of soup.
The cafe is alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No washing, no shaving...
I can stay out of the car for a week, my wife has prepared everything for me on the road.
A week will last, - comforts another truck driver Viktor Skotarenko.
Will I get to my car in a week?
How much do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a crystal bottle or water insisted on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take while there is something else, - the seller parries.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the regional authorities.
The leadership of the Amvrosiivka and Novoazovskaya district state administrations were instructed to provide all those who stand in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, said Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Regional State Administration Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance crews are now on duty at the checkpoints.
Bio-toilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem associated with the queues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were idle at the international checkpoints “Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk”, respectively.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership, such a statement was made to the BNS Agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information was published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “tell” the President of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia for interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania more than once and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also, a member of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
Lithuania’s President Grybauskaite has said that she knows about the upcoming information attack.
According to her, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and “the country’s desire for energy independence”.
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that the Kremlin treats Lithuania “not enough respectfully”.
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of putting forward "only demands" to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian “milk” to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country’s government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, the school principal shot at teenagers.
The directors of one of the American secondary schools teenagers literally led to despair.
According to him, the man was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, young bullies threw toilet paper at the man’s house.
Because of this, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several wounds in the leg and arm.
Since the hooligans were not on the territory of the director's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California directly on passers-by on the street.
After that, the criminal took hostage two bystanders, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the elementary school of the city of Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was opened.
Adam’s mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
American school shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlant, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and to arrange a masquerade for our area.
I'm more of a miser now.
I haven’t called in the last two years to give out candy in my apartment and I probably won’t this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow in terms of Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will take $ 1.2 billion of the spent $ 6.9 billion.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexy inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for the men, I think we’re going to see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will hit our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes most searched for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
According to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
It means a lot of funny dog-hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't change.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candy, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-hungry children who are preparing to conquer our neighborhoods.
What’s more, we’ll buy and — let’s not fool ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is corn-grain candy; and yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, nearly 35 million pounds of it is sold under Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween more than a haunted house.
They have amazing titles, such as “The Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Howl and Scream” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the America Haunts Society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you almost described yourself, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can not remove, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like “cool facial expression.”
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving Jack's lampstand is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, pumpkin baby fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving those pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a harder job, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2,032 pound pumpkin.
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the morning cyber attack, the press service of the department reports.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Taymar Peterkop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly adjusted everything, by now the work of the site has been restored.
"The damage to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
“We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,” he said.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted an appeal in the network, in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Defense Ministry and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO alliance.
Ukraine does not need a European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone’s slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
“Hands off Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that a company of the Marine Corps of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO reaction force Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to a riot of evil spirits, several schools and a hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe’s southern Matabeleland province have been forced to close because students were attacked by goblins.
According to the local elder, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue classes.
The story of the goblins may sound like an invention of a child for a European, but in Africa this is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of evil spirits.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed due to the fact that the medical staff was also attacked by goblins.

We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of rallying in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of rallying.
We were very happy to develop the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
The Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brotherly Circle" - Novye Izvestia
About it writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After the media reported on the inclusion of the U.S. Treasury Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brother’s Circle”, we looked through all the databases, but such a group was not found,” — said the Agency interlocutor.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously wrote “NI”, yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brotherly Circle”.
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Grisha", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth are indicated.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States believe that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket was carrying money for the bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The department noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The inclusion of a person in the black lists of the American Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikova said that no notification to the singer was received: “It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Grigory, who everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States.”
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
“And, of course, it’s all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other — surprising and unexpected,” she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escaped on the field in the match "Chinnik"
Became known some details about the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the match 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl “Shinnik” and Moscow “Spartacus”.
As stated by the head of the RFU KDC Arthur Grigoryants, citing data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
In addition, Grigoryants spoke about how the fan managed to break through on the field: “It turned out that this one, let’s call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance - this was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed the two attendants away and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribunes to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribunes.
He ran through the field.
Stewards are responsible for this.
Before the entry into force of the law on sports, this is the zone of action of stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the Eastern Tribune.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern stand and on the treadmills,” said the head of the KDC.
Recall that the decision of KDK Moscow “Spartak” will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against “Locomotive” and “Zenith”, and will pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous quarry ledge
Coker Spaniel Ruby Escaped After Getting Into a Small Car Accident
Three days later, she was stuck in a career, noticed a man walking a dog.
Firefighters descended on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after fire crews were called to pick him up and take him to safety, after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous ledge of a steep slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappy's career in Denholm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted messages on social media sites after she ran into a quarry after a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dog breeder spotted Ruby getting stuck at 50 feet on a career ledge.
A technical rescue team from Clecchiton Fire Station rushed to the scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carry-on to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a steep slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue, she completely froze.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and was found to be fine except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got it back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she were exhausted and lost consciousness, she would most likely fall.
Firefighters were great.
It was very brave of them to do what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson, from the town of Kitley, added: “We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and noted, "He flirted with me when I was 18."
She added, “It was a long time ago and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the 70-year-old Jagger said he "categorically denies that he ever hit on Katy Perry."
The spokesperson added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the artists who appeared as guests on this year's Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There comes a line of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrian's shaft.
True, Strathclyde pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movements across the rest of Europe, though — predictably — this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules around in ways that are convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to replace what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a story that deserves attention.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: the first time I heard the “duck” that “independence means passport control” was at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an old fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here’s the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or to the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party — founded just this year — emerged out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in September’s federal election, thus effectively ousting the Free Democrats (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits — that was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a pre-emptive disadvantage in terms of production opportunities in comparison with Germany.
The only saving means is to cut wages and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and the currency is a deeper problem of Europe’s productive abilities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures implemented by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
These are paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France’s shattered economy in distress.
The result is Marine Le Pen’s right-wing anti-EU National Front party has just won a crucial by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split among the right will automatically be in favor of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If, as is very likely, anti-EU parties gain support in these elections, such a bloc would be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here’s my opinion: soon rising sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and a few dependent economies could save the euro, but France and southern Europe would recover their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
Where does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will be able to do well under a looser European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway’s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, winning an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the resulting Tory and Liberal Democrats coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland now to vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: getting older earlier
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is near.
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared if her daughter begins to develop breast rudiments and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At this week’s American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — it doesn’t usually mean I’m going to have full sexual maturity,” Caplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“Once the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “premature” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may serve as the basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on a child’s age, developmental level, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is cautious with medications, but admits that “repressing puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’ll handle hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many touted theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys - as in girls - puberty comes earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the premise that holds the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which links the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.
Other data support this finding, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency to full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier-than-expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing to fly
The American plane, which carried out observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Treaty on Open Skies and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the city’s air harbor.
The airport authorities allowed the departure of the aircraft, receiving money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
As reported, flying in Ulan-Ude plane landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita Airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, and they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and has 34 member states.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, and enhance the capacity to prevent crises and resolve crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities earn - MK in the US MK
The rating of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $ 125 million.
But it was surpassed by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Significantly lag behind him other departed from the life of celebrities who last year “earned” several times less.
The second in the list of the most "wealthy" departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million for the year, and the line below is the author of comics Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who last year was the leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow opened the first boutique of Igor Gulyaev
On October 23, the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now they will be able to appreciate even more fans of fashion - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, about which the designer and hosted a party in the style of Dolce Vita.

I am glad that I have opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
It was with such words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone to try on the models he liked!
Manufacturers of jet aircraft are at odds over the width of the seat when large orders are at stake
A fierce dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at this month’s Dubai Air Show.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always in the center of attention of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says that this should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 people in a row - is central to the statements about the cost-effectiveness of new projects "mini-airbuses".
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economy class more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a rival version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on seats 18 inches wide, 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now reaching out directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pinned to each other, titled "Would you agree to this?"
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of an average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist circumference of those recently called the “reactive public” was already.
Airbus says it commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ seat size figures and says manufacturers shouldn’t get involved in decisions about how airlines balance fares and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It really comes down to giving airlines the choice and opportunity to do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s cabin specialist.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for aircraft orders valued at at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20% increase in profitability by one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The claimed characteristics of Boeing are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seater 777X series with the original 9-seater layout of the 777 constructive solution series.
The gain in unit cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seater layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus’s head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a tight seating arrangement that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ offer is driven by a threat from the 777 model,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet salesmen even carry roulettes with them to check out competing layouts.
While extolling comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “take off”, but can distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
New anti-nicotin vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell College of Medicine in New York said the first results were encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy could finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine kick.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that weren’t given the vaccine were “relaxed,” a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers said.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow Region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of rural settlements in the Moscow Region are fully subsidized.
In total, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - one hundred percent of subsidies.
As part of the budget provision, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget,” Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough at all."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region before the end of November to think about which settlements need to be consolidated, merged into urban districts or change the administrative system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Earlier, the Governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisk, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomna districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Moscow City Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region are planning to unite as part of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that out of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that it is now Arbenina especially devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to mess with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she pampered the fans, showing how she dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
To race on broomsticks ready! our first Halloween "- so called Diana a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an “indefinite gender” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow hermaphrodite-born children to be registered as “unspecified” instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right for a while to leave the box "sex" in the birth certificate is not filled.
Instead of “F” (female) or “M” (male), parents can write “X” (indefinite) for a while.
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to “clarify” the sex.
According to statistics, one in two thousand newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodee has denied changes to the lease of offshore properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid lobbied several state ministers to extend leases on Serkyular Key, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without going through a tender after they expired in August 2005.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in the properties, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynn Ashpole on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for open competition.
Tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the leases on Serkyular Ki, which brought about $2.5 million a year to the Obaid family, were extended without being put up for open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open tenders.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, had strongly advised changes to the Government's rental policy.
The ICAC transcript of the phone calls cited conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obaid in the fisheries department.
“Was the issue discussed in these phone calls a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes on cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on 457 subclass visas can be tested for "authenticity"
The test of “authenticity” for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it outlines an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied against criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified positions or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
“The loud statements like ‘foreigners are at the end of the queue’ and ‘jobs to Australians first’ represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by the former Minister of immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he meets with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the criteria for "authenticity" are accepted, the visa applicant can be examined for "whether the candidate is genuine in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise."
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of subclass 457 visa holders, as previously businesses intending to sponsor a small number of employees then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving by boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
This man's grief-stricken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the vessel.
Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Friend Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semena Varlamova Evgenia Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club “Colorado”.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete in moving around the country, but forbade approaching Vavrinyuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed service to Scotland and the north of England, with the start of Phase One in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “unite the UK”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” by the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase II is completed, the lines will be routed to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from ?32.7 billion to ?42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements to the railway's capacity and reduced travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connections thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unambiguously” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK."
We are therefore delighted to be working in partnership with the UK Government to consider options to build a high-speed railway in Scotland, create benefits for all and continue the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Thorium - the new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
Combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power does without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
The rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia so far will remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the rules relating to these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided that they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that it is considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times, and from passengers to comply with safety rules, which they are informed by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of use on board its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the customer experience now that it (on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will abide by the rules currently in place.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not plan to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to U.S. airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage regulations and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” said the FAA.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the recommendation of the group, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Head of Dagestan hears notes of extremism in the anthem of Kuban
The football match between Anzhi and Kuban resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday invited republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly calls for ethnic hatred, in particular, calls for war with “Basurmans”.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it is in our time in 1995 that this anthem was approved.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here as a mother of our native, enemy, basurmanina we go to the death fight" - why such words are written into the anthem, to poison some believers on other believers ", - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov, the Chairman of the Parliament Hizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from across the ocean, namely Syria, where we learned today that Israel has attacked Russian-made missiles that were reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its production of chemical weapons by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the U.S. not to conduct the military operation it approached this summer.
Read more about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president, will tell our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said the Assad regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal made by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
A longer and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As far as I know, it’s about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad’s days are numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and needs to leave.
But Assad remains.
And feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Treaty has been hailed as a success for diplomacy, inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has given the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child starves to death, his mother is hardly relieved by not being killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is still standing.
They change weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has created a separate Ministry of construction and housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry responsible for construction and housing and offered to head it to the former governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new Ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.
Mikhail Men - the son of the famous Orthodox priest Archpriest Alexander Me, graduated from the Moscow Gubkin Institute of Petrochemistry.
Since 1995, he began his political career - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergiev Posad district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the Moscow region government, the deputy prime minister of the Moscow government.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
Owners of pawn shops in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemir shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is rising — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its deal, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry loan is not just a quick way to get money ($1300 in Ms. Amirthaling’s case), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — just above the 15.4% offered at the branch of United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn shops as families feel pressured by rising living costs and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to offset declining incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, cited an increase in family leverage, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income scales] will look for ways to replenish their incomes wherever they can,” says Song Seng-Wung, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record-high gold prices in the past two years have intensified the rush with which people pawn their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to get paid for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items laid in 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
“People say, ‘The price of gold looks good, let’s put down Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.’
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the Singapore Stock Exchange listing.
While some lenders have drawn fire from high interest rates, Ms Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also doesn’t increase debt directly.
“Customers are pawning items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The facility is gaining increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, laying down gold bars or a Rolex watch that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of available medical institutions and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care in the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and women in labor.
So, after the merger with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the GUZ "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, modern equipment that meets international standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for major repairs of premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased in the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room during the caesarean section, the apparatus "Sell-Saver" is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and after special treatment return it to the mother, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's clinic has an electronic registry, and in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic charts and medical records of patients.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it became possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens have been arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to a Strasbourg hotel and then beat and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old previously convicted native of Chechnya.
Bayern defender David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he ahead of representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the German Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin's ex-wife rests with actor Andrei Chadov
The former civil wife of the football player of St. Petersburg “Zenith” Andrei Arshavin Julia Baranovskaya spends a vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiance - figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Pictures from joint walks of couples published in Instagram Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrew and Julia.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a picture in which the pair stands hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit midfielder Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Julia.
Recall that Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin meets with ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin’s new girlfriend was married to a top manager of the corporation.
A $325 million rescue package for health care in Tasmania
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s weakened healthcare system will be complemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to prevent a crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher rates of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The decision to fund within four years was made after consultations between the government and independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state,” Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a blitz campaign on scheduled operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without pre-registration, in Hobart and Lonseston, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, train medical professionals, mental health services and introduce personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“This investment will go towards implementing ideas expressed by leading doctors on how best to help Tasmania’s health care system,” Ms Plibersek said.
The minister insisted that the Tasmanian government would operate under strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would solve nothing “unless they are followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable footing.”
Nevertheless, he praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope the federal aid package will go a long way toward getting this state’s health care system out of a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional sample procedures largely offset recent reductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement represents “a solution similar to a Band-Aid.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s Labour government pulled $430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government pulls off almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can not pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package was spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nickle's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts an exceptional production and historical details, but it is also harder perceived than it should have been.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic priestess and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to vulgarity or sensation - and that's the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story risks becoming a test like hairdressing for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, says monitoring group
Syria has destroyed its main chemical weapons and munitions production facilities, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites believed to hold toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the country’s civil war began nearly three years ago.
The declaration of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “disable” all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed into poison gas and filled with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, in which, according to experts, there is a facility for the production of chemical weapons, as well as their storage, according to the British-based Syrian center for the protection of human rights.
A group of activists who tracked the casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of this number, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
The death toll also included 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The United Nations estimates that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safir with rebels, many of whom are affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specifics.
The fighting highlighted the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all of Syria's declared critical means of production and mixing/refuelling equipment."
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program contained therein have been moved to other declared sites that have been verified."
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the Safir site was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I salute the courage and bravery you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the group’s director general, Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against the Assad government and its security forces, which are made up of members of its Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over Bali attack's sentencing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb attack in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the conspirators who appeared in court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he is released on parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, though they could have insisted that a man dubbed a “detonator” for his reputation as an explosives maker should be sentenced to death.
The decision deepened the painful memories of Perth’s June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he has to follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He should be brought before the firing squad," said Ms Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in a parked van just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack stuffed with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre, Amrozi, Muhlasa and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
This guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the last person to face trial in Bali.
He had been in hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that the intelligence data showed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” Ms. Cortin said.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Cortin says.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not call from a mobile phone)”
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives a "good".
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling “on duty at school” when it comes to this issue.
But an internet connection for surfing, exchanging emails, texting, or downloading data would still be banned at less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there are still no "Words with Friends" - an intellectual Internet game, which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a sensational incident: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the exit of the landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when a plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the matter recommended last month that the government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA in order to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no good security reasons for the bans.
Observance of restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when flipping pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded the entire airliner with their Kindle e-book readers and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only isolated messages from pilots confirming that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off the devices while boarding the devices in reduced visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, director general of the U.S. Travel Association.
Driving schools will be able to conduct examinations for obtaining a driver's license
Driver's license exams will be accepted by private companies that have their own computerized circuit.
This writes “Kommersant” with reference to the draft government resolution “On admission to driving vehicles”.
According to the newspaper, currently in Russia there are only about 30 such circuits.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will take into account the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Traffic Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of theory exams and more than 20% of the site students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the racetracks contained in the draft government decree come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for learning to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take the urban driving test to qualify for category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into the wild
The bird, airlifted ashore after it was found in a depleted state on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water cowgirl was placed in a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at a rescue center in Alloa.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "This water herdsman is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird has become exhausted and was able to find shelter on the oil tower.
He added: "She was unable to take off again, so we were approached for help."
The water cowherd was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes the creators of welfare and jobs of the UK want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the trading zone of Europe - even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed with this.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority want the UK to pursue a course toward treaty change and a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business insists on a “significant change” that will bring the powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high — achieving changes to the treaty and more favorable terms for the UK will ensure a 16 percent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for UK business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as our survey shows, for business, this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory framework of Brussels.
U.S. Secret Service taps Pope’s personal phone
The Vatican’s activities are under the watchful eye of U.S. intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence was listening to all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and now closely patronizes Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under review.
What in the United States was of particular importance.
The intelligence service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose the next Pope.
The phones of the residence where the participants of the conclave lived were also tapped.
American spies were listening to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the "great ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the completion of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been singled out in the United States as the future Pope.
U.S. intelligence also tracked negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work in the Roman embassy, extracting information about politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that he did not care about the American “wiretapping”, even if it happens.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But on the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free storage of StockExchange photo, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a tutorial on Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaoreview" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi is depicted, on the other - the view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the Repin Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping, but in the end they chose snowboarding, since this is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public regarding the wide distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak is not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the state mark Natalia Nikiforova told “Izvestia” that all the arguments regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.
Snowboarder on the banknote turned to the right, in the photos on the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The man in the photo shoot to create a bill was shot from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - the characteristic position of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, since the artist received a salary for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - says Alexey Popovichev, executive director of NP RusBrand.
It is quite difficult to prove the 100% similarity of images on the bill and in photo banks, so claims to challenge intellectual property on this image are unlikely to come.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Russian law bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Initially, businesses were looking for growth.
After all, this year is bad for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
About all this told the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Products of everyday demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
Government regulation of the market was discussed.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, since in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content.
In no country in the world there is such a severe restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have a special effect, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
Most affected by the manufacturers of beer introduced this year, the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” said Isaac Sheps.
There are two predictions for next year.
Optimistic - the one about which Shaps said: sales of foamy drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - fall by another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from varieties designed for the mass consumer to the premium class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not yet visible.
“According to my observations, the level of diseases of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said the doctor-narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use strong drink surrogates has increased, as well as those who are hooked on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like Jaguar, whereas ten years ago it was beer alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car factory in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all dismissed received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, there is a question of reducing industrial production in the region.
Deputy of the regional ZakSa Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that about 600 people were reduced at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, it happened back in September: then under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
The workers, who decided to resign on their own, were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's gonna stop there.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation,” he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not refuted and not confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will publish it.
Talk about reducing workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk has been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to lay off 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of production of cars.
As the reason for the plant called the fall in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, in the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile during the takeoff and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the airliner approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will come into force by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers of flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft equipment and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, in the UK, it is also possible to revise the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights.
For the "Russian mafia" in the United States finally secured a new name - "Brotherly Circle"
This week, the black list of the “Russian mafia” in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury Department has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the Brotherhood.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, the US blacklist includes 22 people involved in the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
“The Brotherhood statement is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, the “Brotherly Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” Galeotti was quoted as saying by the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she told the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brotherly Circle” unites to a greater extent the approximate Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely connected with Grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandfather Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were rather united by common financial and criminal interests, for example, the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the “Brotherly Circle” has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press Secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria marks new era in gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other countries located further along the route of the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The pipeline's annual design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsky district, the driver of the Peugeot car drove to the oncoming lane for 115 km of the Odessa-Reni highway, and collided with a bus in which there were six people.
This is reported by the press service of the Department of Emergency Situations in the Odessa region.
As a result of the accident, the 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot car died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured.
The doctors gave the woman first aid on the spot, from hospitalization she refused.
Emergency medical personnel also examined all other passengers.
Rescuers with the help of a crane lifted the bus and freed the bus driver, whose leg was clamped at the door of the bus.

Two YMCA employees accused of sexual crimes before charges against Jonathan Lord, as it became known to the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were brought in 2011 against Caringbach child care worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse reported.
But the commission’s opening statement said it had “never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he was aware of the first case but did not know of the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA, in its opening speech to the commission, also made an inaccuracy, claiming that "there were external audits of the YMCA acknowledging that the YMCA is in the forefront of child safety."
The evidence presented to the commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second-to-last of four possible assessments from a quality audit performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and lower management had made a blunder by hiring Lord and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the staff's obligations regarding reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
The staff testified that they had observed the violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his lap, saying that he loved one of them and allowing them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lord's direction and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnath, the child custody manager for the YMCA's Caringbach branch, who was Lord's supervisor, "very intimidating and often difficult to reach."
The chief executive said he did not accept employees’ explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their senior executives.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr Hare said he had submitted to the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" did not "concern the provision of information" by the staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA's Director General of Child Care, Liam Wheatley.
He said it was meant to prevent corruption of the evidence, but at the same time “overdone” and this decision was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not safe for children during Jonathan Lord’s tenure between 2009 and 2011, according to child molestation expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearing is postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in Sao Paulo.
At home, she is not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bundschen left her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, these days and this week she came to the show specially.
A month-long absence did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the defile of the brand "Kolchchi".
Fashion week finals are usually the most interesting shows.
Sort of what stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of pret-a-porter luxury, the fashion designer is actively working in the theater and in the cinema, making out performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30 thousand firms and companies that are related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the closing fashion week in Sao Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamically developing spheres of production, it employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and the annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair has said he will seize the chance to return as UK prime minister, but admits a return is unlikely.
On the eve of the evening in an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since resigning in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it’s unlikely to happen, so...”
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw result in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to leading players.
“I’m sorry we didn’t win,” Allegri told Tmw.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we did not allow Lazio anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general I cannot say that we lost concentration.
I should have won.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Equestrian event experts coming to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he made his first steps, this kid with his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair - of equal height - received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank equestrian center in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Coming to the public eye against the background of men and women in elegant hats-boilers, he moved his cap on the back and proudly held in a circle of two-year-old Toffee.
The judges praised Fenton for his not at all years of developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was given a gift by Toffee for his third birthday last March, and has been practicing with a Shetland pony every day since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffee make a great duo.”
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rosette.
It was just his second performance with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The whole audience was amazed, and everyone shouted cheers and clapped."
He ran across the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon take part in the “horse of the year” — and I’m sure that he will perform well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffey were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the call “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, the press regulator reports.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false articles about the state-owned company.
Now the “New Express” must go through the “process of full correction of errors”, as the regulator reports.
The order to “correct mistakes” came from the Guangdong Office of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express newspaper published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The management of the editorial office of the New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it was decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction to the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate those responsible for the situation and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with the confession that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reporting.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of beating confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-incriminate.
Discovered a tunnel USA — Mexico for drug trafficking, equipped with its own railway
Found one of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described this four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags make up the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, making it easier to covertly load drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they found the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October that challenged drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage length of about 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions increase in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November, BelTA learned from the main pension department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
From November 1 of this year, the average wage of employees in the republic, applied during the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with a 5.4% increase in its value and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be made in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "On increasing pensions".
As a result of the recalculation from November, labor pensions for age will increase, according to estimates, by an average of 5.3%.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
Expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase in the budget of the subsistence minimum on average per capita.
BPM for the period from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one in effect from August 1 to October 31.
Accordingly, by 2.1% from November 1, the size of minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be increased.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion was pledged for the payment of pensions taking into account increases in 2013.
British police hand Assange extradition notice
British police today handed notice of the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian an “official demand to surrender” with a demand to report to a police station, adding that if that requirement was not met, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the U.S., he took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
“Scotland Yard has handed the 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” the spokesman said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the service of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible espionage charges following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
A driver driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs has been fined 1,000 euros.
The motorist was fined 1,000 euros for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howe, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz at the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a takeaway drink between his legs.
In the Colchester Magistrates' Court, Howe pleaded guilty to driving without due diligence and attention.
Adding seven penalty points to his driving license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howey was also ordered to pay a cost of 90 euros and an additional fee for assistance to victims of crime in the amount of 100 euros.
Tax for foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% state duty rate for homes worth more than 2 million euros and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes in the partnership rather than as individuals.
At the moment, the state duty on residential property in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, the north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “After increasing state duty on expensive homes and introducing related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London or current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The value of prime real estate — the top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market by price — in London’s affluent southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
According to Savills research, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but they were eclipsed by an actively developing “domestic market” with a surge in prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tail to the right (from a dog's point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say other members of the canine family may notice these subtle differences in tail wagging and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
In dogs, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the versatile twisting of the tails of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs videos of dogs - either naturalistic versions or silhouette - to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw that the otherwise unexpressive dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging dog's tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail leaned predominantly to the left (again in terms of the wagging tail of the dog), their heartbeats increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried about and what not.
He observes: “If there are multiple encounters with other dogs and often wagging their tails in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to test whether left and right sides matter for dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
And in another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the wagging of its tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming alarmed —the opposite behavior in relation to an Italian study.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs respond to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence from different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to illness of Alex Turner
Arctic Monkeys have postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was scheduled to perform at the city's Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official Arctic Monkeys website, they said: "Following the decision to move the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately he is unable to perform."
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro venue will take place on November 21.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.
We want to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this has caused them.

Pope Francis to Name First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will install new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately be involved in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a gathering of all current cardinals, known as the consistory, would be held before the ceremony.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to drop by February.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in this situation before - all this is for the first time for us.
Valero said the popes used to appoint cardinal bishops from major parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises — so we don't know who he's going to name."
GM recalls a number of new pickup trucks in the US to refine the seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix problems with manual seat back adjustment, according to a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilting mechanism of the backs.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“When a vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice posted on its website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into mass production for a leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM told owners of pickup trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that reduced car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
Shares of GM on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose by 1.4 percent to $ 37.47.
Obama's Voter Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope for change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to derail laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the Obama-reformed health care system’s website, drone attacks
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me in times of discouragement in my second year of medical school and revive a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “Audacity to Win,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and performances could be breathtaking.
The election victory turned out to be impressive, and the leading news programs paused to reflect on this historical moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our military from Iraq, repealing the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule, and killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the ability to choose public health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among others.
But after countless times standing on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I’ve run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on Americans’ privacy by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to meet the limits of government funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And more recently, it cannot justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that the leadership may be at odds with the political campaigns that precede it?
Obviously, running for office is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and by random events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, from all the examples I have listed above, it can be seen that they were largely the administration’s own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an unintelligible and crude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes that we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me yearn for many promises that have faded away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a resounding defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal and stay true to their goal.
“I want us to get our appeal back,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made the announcement at a time when he was trying to brush aside questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to lift carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only have been with ministers, and said Mr Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get the leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for a seat from the Sunshine Coast constituency of Fairfax with a margin of 53 votes after recounting the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election counting procedure to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be made two months after we have voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why don’t we have a system where we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote right away and get a result at 6:30 that evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil nowadays seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring e-voting opportunities and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job “very seriously.”
Public service involves serving the community.
"We are not seeking any awards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange operations unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further confirmation that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees suspended in the unfolding investigation, which echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
Refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people familiar with the matter said RBS had handed over records of emails and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the UK’s regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Usher, retired from RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted a leave of absence in his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr Asher’s instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to people familiar with the matter.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal audits or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks look through instant messages and emails over several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
News of the inspections has rattled traders in what has in recent years been one of the biggest sources of revenue for investment banks’ trading units, which this year, however, has faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by saying that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market for a very small price”.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it fired one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week after he caused nearly $6 million in losses late last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that individual orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government’s tax authority.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further ruled that requiring states to increase compliance with Medicaid program requirements, otherwise they would lose all federal funding to Medicaid program, is not unconstitutionally enforceable.
A lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Is football a cause of division?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the “Open Tribune”, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game - only scandals and strife.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society”, politicians and the media should be correct in their statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV programs threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate ...
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are a “model conflict that could be predicted”, but “we have too many people and authorities responsible for these questions”, and seven babysitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced against migrants, according to the publicist, has failed, and we must find our own way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified history textbook.
“It is also necessary to create a manual on the history of culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for "calls to dismember Russia": "If in the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, then you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "ignite".
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: “In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!”
The leader of the faction “United Russia” Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a “charter” and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can take on the same obligations.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole has been established, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited a law that assigns responsibility for international peace on their territory to regional and municipal authorities.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share her enthusiasm for this law: it does not have “clear ideas about what the adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, the subjects will interpret differently the scope of these powers.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, do not have the means, and the center does not give them methodological recommendations that they could use.
The head of the Duma Committee on nationalities Hajimet Safaraliyev proposed to create a special agency with the dreaded name “Ministry of national security”, which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio”, to whom you could turn, if anything.
"We are walking on the edge, the shells are tearing apart, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church for relations with society, said.
No neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, religious including, in his opinion, should not.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, we still need to look for, but they are being pushed on the wrong path, on the wrong road," he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "That footballer is beaten with the whole crowd, that flags burn, that comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There is another sport called rugby.
"They will not be equal in the world in this sport!" - hotly said pravoros.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - immediately intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky.
You will offer them more curling!
It is necessary to know the national characteristics, it is like the Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer.
In Yaroslavl, the representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves with wild behavior in the stands - during the game with the local club.
Football will be banned across the country.
The head of the RFU Control and Disciplinary Committee Artur Grigoryants said that Kuban was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports Philip Papenkov from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for burning the flag of Dagestan by fans at the stand during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the Premier League.
We researched all the available materials.
For improper behavior of the audience “Kuban” was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei filed lawsuits for patents Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, whose price it beat at a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, has filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match Internet search keywords to their respective ads, the lawsuit said, which is the foundation of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running Google’s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in which the Motorola patent library was the determining factor.
“Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire the patents at auction that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months ago.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after overthrowing the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are committed to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence has been a banned organization targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pump, traffic was stopped for only a short time to let its convoy through the normally busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been derided as a non-charismatic "spare wheel" by the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has skyrocketed since his victory and Friday's speech in which he attempted to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but for all those who want to bring the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak to an end.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-paneled hall where he was sworn in.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, which performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the stand “meekly”.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and people - one hand”, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a bastion of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to return the powers of the president, whose post was stripped by a military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he fulfills the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
Within the framework of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was held.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov told, in 2011, with the appearance of the new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and the installation of equipment for their production.
This year more than 7 thousand tons of products were shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, Denis Gribanov said.
In October, a new camp was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for heating, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is undergoing retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in housing and communal services.
The company’s management aims to cover up to 70 percent of the Tyumen region’s demand for these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also aimed at forms of state support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider the subsidy agreements, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
The funds are reduced to 72 million rubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was compensation for the mineral extraction tax, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do this and subsidies become direct spending obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the government of the region considers the priority to be the direct support of industrial enterprises, and not the financing of the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oil companies.
The subsidy for the equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle band of Russia, where cheaper labor is available.
In addition, the question is unclear with the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders at Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
Currently, enterprises of the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes from oil produced in the Uvat region will go to the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video on the social network
The Leninsky district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work a resident of the city, who posted in the social network video extremist orientation, told RIA Novosti on Friday the representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in a popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliating the dignity of a person committed publicly.”
“The Leninsky district court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of committing the above crime, imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work,” the source said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians the collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the Association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will significantly decrease.
This means that prices should also go down.
“This is about goods that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should not be a price increase either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not quite so, or to be more precise, it is not so at all,” Azarov concluded.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that a teacher of one of the kindergartens in Biysk locked a child in the basement for educational purposes.
Currently, investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation of bad taste Evgeny Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilieva, to whose person for almost a year attracted close attention of the media, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about the thefts in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with the former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and about her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of Oboronservis broke his silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: “Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out of me any negative information about the former defense minister.”
I was blackmailed into testifying, or I'd be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court to prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of winning.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilyev was most touched by the words that she does not matter with taste.
Probably, it refers to the statement of the official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant in the case of “Oboronservice”, fakes were found.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, at the same time they said that I was bad with taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it’s just a mess,” says Vasilyeva.
When asked if she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 alleged criminal episodes, Vasilyeva said: “Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead people, that’s all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva evades studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant said that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case."
What was the reason for the revelations under house arrest Vasilyeva, still not communicating with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she could not fail to answer the charge of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolskaya, who claimed a couple of days ago that she “fell into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov’s reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
Viktor Baranets, a well-known military observer of the KP, wrote in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?": "Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations."
Previously, Vasilyeva some charges of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of defense took on.

Do you think travel agents have become a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be on the opposite trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its main full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with a previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If current benchmarks are met, this will be a 12-17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million earned in 2011/2012.
Managing director Graeme Turner said Flight Centre made an 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half of the year with good performance, especially on weekday trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been operating at a profit for our 10 countries, and for some of them for the full year, a record high profit is expected before interest and tax contributions are deducted,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the largest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Its U.S. business offset losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20.

Another game club was found in Leninsky district on the street of Anton Petrov.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for Barnaul reports that administrative materials on the article “Illegal organization and conduct of gambling” have been compiled.
Techniques removed.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who brutally murdered two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the GU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, found the bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
The identities of the dead were soon established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented a burned apartment a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
Internal affairs bodies work out various versions of the murder, check the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose women rented an apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction beginning in 1914.
The exam will also feature "extracurricular texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English Language and Literature course will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due tomorrow to release new curricula in English and Mathematics, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure of the final exams of secondary school, with a new system of assessments and a smaller amount of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we must reform our exam system to regain public trust", insisting that school final exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools average 143 hours per year, while Singapore has about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on math schedules, coalition sources said that large-scale school final math exams, combined with an increased coefficient in the ranking table, are likely to serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-life challenges,” including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, tourists will begin to carry hovercraft.
For those who want to travel to China, this means additional costs.
A ticket for a puma is traditionally much more expensive than for a boat.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
Travel through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not rise in price: at the same price puma carried tourists and last spring, and a year ago - in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: the GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that Russia’s GDP growth rate is insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned GDP growth of about 3% this year, maybe even a little more.
It will actually be less than 2%.
Against the background of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us this is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done.

Travel through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
There aren’t many doctors in this West African country — just one in 5,000.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him the CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and again fall unconscious, wandering through hospitals that were not equipped properly to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we'd take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwell said.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
A lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Bwelle’s father passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of health spending in this country is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Yaoundé.
He also founded the non-profit ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are packed into vans, tied to roofs with medical supplies, and driven across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They don’t always have luck.
More than once they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: it’s a celebration with songs and dances and the best spaces the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwelle with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, municipality, or in a house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitary handling of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an unbearable pace, but the dedication of the brigade usually helps to support the village musicians.
"They're beating the drums all night so we can stay awake and keep working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students have performed 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” he said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60% of the funding to his nonprofit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Kathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell's group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O’Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bwella in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity for practice they would never get at home.
"We were given the opportunity to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise made to his father, is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.

Snowden agreed to testify about the wiretapping Merkel
Deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel met with Moscow Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Prosecutor General’s Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by US special services.
Snowden said he was ready to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," Hans-Christian Strebel said, "that he knows a great deal.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spyware.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the US electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA correspondent reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the state administrations of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves,” Vladimir Makei said.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, following which a protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment spheres, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as searching for new forms and directions of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners,” he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that at the talks, the foreign ministers of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, it is necessary to increase and bring it to $ 1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is untapped potential in this area, he said.
Our countries have always had very warm relations, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to talk about health care
Amid a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his often-repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama slightly tweaked his original public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “resurrection in the news” over the termination of services, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You’ll get better terms,” he said.
The administration said no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me be clear to these Americans: You deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said the launch of the online sales site has been “horrificly bad” since October.
“I’m just as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I really want to regain your trust.”
Sybelius dropped the phrase, which was caught by the microphone, sitting behind her assistant at yesterday’s hearing in the house after a heated debate with member of the House of Representatives Billy Long, Republican from Missouri, about whether she herself must join the Obama health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Agency “Rosbalt” was deprived of the status of the media for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license to register the Rosbalt agency, Lenta writes.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of the status of the media - for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to make counterarguments.
What is Rosbalt
CJSC "Information Agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency’s exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talk about the proximity of the publication to the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions, it was said that Natalya Chaplina, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, Chaplina’s role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not completely clear: she is most often called the “project manager”.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - neither by citation nor by audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the ranking of attendance of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the last five months are notes about the Kremlin’s helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group “King and Fool”, and pogroms in the capital city of Biryulev.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, banning journalists from swearing.
The Agency found prohibited language in two published on the Agency’s website videos (“Dzhigit from Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot desecrated oil rigs”).
The other parties are described differently.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the discovered video materials accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a demand to take away the agency’s license.
Rosbalt stated that the claims of the department are incorrect: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the material words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in the world court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the justice of the peace decided not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been decided even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, effectively depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov said about the illegality of the closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that it would not come to the revocation of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction the media is safer in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
Damascus completed this first phase of disarmament one day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, toxic substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, the OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise the inspectors of new sites for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia, destroy or put out of service all capacities for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and for filling shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been passed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is assumed that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, mustard skin gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
For its destruction, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action - this is given two weeks.
The head of the OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors “personally monitored the destruction of equipment.”
“They no longer have the ability to further produce or mix chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the factories for the production of shells and toxic substances are either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to be inspected, the document said, but the equipment from there has been transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was “particularly difficult”, as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, there is no time to celebrate this with inspectors yet - they were too busy with work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. spying “went inappropriately far”
John Kerry has shown a softening of tactics to protect U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. spying has “went inappropriately far.”
The Secretary also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s high-profile revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic row with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, and other members of the government, actually took some of the things going on on autopilot because that possibility already existed — both during World War II and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and certainly 9/11.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone inappropriately far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted for good reasons and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We’re working in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and people being killed because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues surrounding alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over National Security Agency surveillance.
“It’s really important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain our supporters in our common anti-terrorism efforts,” Murphy, a first-term Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger about these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, though the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden showing that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Amid the hype, Murphy said his office is organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other legislators involved should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said some degree of "best-intentioned toughness" would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new composition of public monitoring commissions will increase the influence of jailers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new composition of public supervisory commissions (NOCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
ONCs are social structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhayev, the unrest in the Kopei colony - it is through the ONC that most resonant incidents behind bars get publicity.
There is a struggle for control over the ONC between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of ONC, I proposed to make the experience of human rights activities a criterion for selection.
“It was not accepted, and they formed lists without working out the criteria,” Valery Borshchev says.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
When he was a State Duma deputy from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council must vote for the composition of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand applicants are applying for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize additional recruitment for vacant places.
The DEC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital’s commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to get to the capital commission.
But the new composition can re-enter the representative of the “Combat Brotherhood” Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their chairman of the ONC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by a member of the ONK Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
“I don’t eat babies on the back of the truck,” Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list is now voted in the OP.
He considers the disclosure of Borshchov information a form of pressure.
A possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONK.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's Cope riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the ONC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists “missed” the human rights chairman of the local Commission, but was one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
Lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers "the revenge for Kopeysk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONK of Mordovia, which is considered “forceful”: only one human rights activist wanted to join the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent it to other council members.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service, coordinated the compilation of ONC lists.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not believe it is correct to divide candidates for human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom is not taken to predict the results of the vote of the OP council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against jail time in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false claim following a report by Thai police that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday June 10, while two other men were holding her down.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
Prior to the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general-regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunks, who approached the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, it was an alarming time, but we hope she comes home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in a court extending her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel “Eltyshevs”, translated into French.
Recall that it was this novel that became the finalist of four awards: “Clear glade”, “Russian Booker”, “National bestseller” and “Big book”.
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard, built on modern life material stories and stories causes heated debate among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the collected articles about prose and journalism Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand by the word “literature”, as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in the abbreviations in the sections "Abzatsy ..."
