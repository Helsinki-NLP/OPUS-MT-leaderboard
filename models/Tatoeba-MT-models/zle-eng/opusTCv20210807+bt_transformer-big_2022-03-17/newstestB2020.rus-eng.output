How?
If we knew, we probably would have fixed it.
But first of all, I think we need to add in such a component as martial arts.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the “Taipei bill” by the United States
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Taipei bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of China for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguang.
The approval of this bill by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, said Ma Xiaoguang.
Taiwan is part of China, he said, and related issues relate to China’s domestic affairs.
“We call on the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any forces, said Ma Xiaoguang.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
Documents obtained by the publication say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations related to China’s policy fall under the “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context suited to the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under the general ban on “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and can lead to the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: “We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as attracting independent local specialists.”
Russian users TikTok has no specific restrictions on publications, says co-founder of the "Production Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
"Production Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen similar publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Digital, agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on.”
But under these rules, you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over the age of 13.
The administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, its account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

A child in the Rostov region amputated his hand because of an error of doctors, reports “Vzglyad” with reference to the website of the territorial authority of Roszdravnadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, after which he was plastered in the hospital of the Zernograd district.
After some time, the child developed gangrene, amputation was made.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by “Kommersant” with reference to data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave information to telecom operators about more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which customers of various financial organizations called.
In 189 cases, operators found a change of number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases, restrictions were imposed on the use of financial services.
Deputy head of the Department of information security of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced with the substitution of the number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to warnings of the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the law "On Communications".
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a change of number.
As reported in the press service of “Beeline”, some of the information about fraudulent calls, which was passed by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failures in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of numbers of fraudsters, which the operator will contact at each call to check the number.
He explained that in order to create such a base, amendments to the legislation would be required.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary General said this during a speech at Columbia University in new York.
Answering the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also stressed that in his answer he did not give a time frame for Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to fulfill certain conditions in order to meet specific standards.
In Crimea, Zelensky offered an alternative course to NATO
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky instead of a course for joining NATO should be engaged in the establishment of good-neighborly relations with Russia.
On Friday, September 27, said co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told reporters.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to stay in power if relations with the Russian Federation are established.

Barcelona to blackmail Neymar
Spanish Barcelona and its former footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the striker to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: under the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the lawyers of the Brazilian insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When in the capital of Catalonia became aware of the claims of Neymar, “Barcelona” sent a counterclaim.
“Blue-Granates” insist that the bonus was relied on for the execution of the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believe that the player relied on only a quarter of 40 million euros and require a return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the “prodigal” player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, citing insiders, the club’s lawyers told the player’s representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not resolved in the pre-trial procedure, it will exclude the possibility of the Brazilian’s return.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers (Todd Beavers), who went on an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the scum.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could claim the cart because he was the first to dig in the trash.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his home.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller pulled the sword out of his sheath and began waving it in the direction of the cart snatcher.
Beavers told Miller that what was happening was being recorded on video.
After noticing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unfamiliar woman enter his yard and pick up the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving a car without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unfamiliar woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he stayed, did not allow him to light a cigarette.
Riots on three
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions, the further, the more noticeably it breaks up into separate fragments and loses its political content.
Evidence of the very fact of “mass riots” does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will surely leave the security forces in extreme irritation, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minyailo was suddenly released from custody without any obligations, and after a few hours he was completely rehabilitated: the TFR dismissed the charges against him.
Minyailo sat under arrest for almost two months, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two defendants remained in the case in participation in mass riots (initially there were 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, transferred on September 3 under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, to whom the court extended the arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, Art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of a joking petition for Latvia’s accession to the United States

He also added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia’s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the site collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was opened against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia."
Before that, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia’s accession to Russia received six months in prison.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law “On Police” in order to protect law enforcement officers from spreading slanderous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from “distribution in information and communication networks, including on the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including those of a discrediting nature.”
How exactly it is supposed to protect police officers from defamation in the network is not specified.
At the same time, the explanatory note to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by individualizing the mechanism”, already stipulated by the law on the blocking of posts insulting representatives of the authorities, and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law “On Police” should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing “obvious disrespect for the state” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for a repeated violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Soon after, the Chudovskiy District Court of the Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for posting on the network “two records with information in an indecent form that insults human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect for society, the state, and bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation.”

Earlier in September it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market - Sberbank - plans to carry out another reduction in rates on housing loans by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is the pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
It is impossible to exclude the possible harm from such additives.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from the outside enter the body.
Veretennikov called for the revival of Kazakhstan's "Genis".

I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
The Munaitpasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal in my career, will forever remain in my memory!
"Genis" must be reborn!
He has a great history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and believe that the authorities of the city will return their home club to them!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

Hydrometeorological center called the right people’s signs
In Russia, there are many popular signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
According to the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Vilfand, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be beautiful, as our ancestors noted.
And if the sky is white, then the next day there will be rain.
The second working sign is based on the observation of birds.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then this is usually to the rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity is high, the flies get wet wings and the birds are forced to decline to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents, there are people’s signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.

Unidentified oil slicks found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The pollution points were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first detected oil slicks began to arrive on September 2.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the detected samples.
It turned out that they are all identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transferred for analysis, said that they do not correspond to the composition of the oil extracted from deposits in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it fell into the ocean current,” said the coordinator of the union of oil workers of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba, Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
In the meantime, experts of the institute recommend tourists and local residents to bypass the oil slicks and notify about all the detected pollution hotspots.

The business community demanded to cancel the existing SanPiN, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
There are 33 departments on the list.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and rules by 40 times by 2021.

A man was working in the Skuratov district of Tula.
He stole batteries and car radios from cars.
Of the two cars - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - the kidnapper took the batteries, presumably for further sale.

The stolen attacker probably intended to resell.
The 26-year-old is currently unemployed.
Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to the country in full force earned the bill on the guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another thing is how timely its introduction is with us.
“In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future,” said Matvienko.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and accrual of pensions, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them."
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to ensure that the size of pensions, social security of citizens is improved.
But steps in this direction should be thought out, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko said.
The head of the Federation Council stressed that if this initiative (the bill on the guaranteed pension product) develops, then several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation on September 6 announced the sending for approval of the draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for joining the savings system, ensuring the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens from the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have agreed.
Image caption The news of the departure of his beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many devoted fans
One of the most famous characters in the comics - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to agree on the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This became known from a press release from Sony, which states that the third part of “Spider-Man” with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of revenues, because of which “Spider-Man” will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the movie hero are owned by Sony.
She leased them for Marvel films, which are owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from the box office, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It’s amazing that Spider-Man’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“All of us at Marvel Studios are thrilled to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
“This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world,” he said in a statement.
At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is creating its own cinema universe, built just around Spider-Man.
“It so happened that he is the only superhero endowed with superpowers, who found himself in different cinema universes.
So, as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the film “The Wolf of Wall Street”, in which the hero of Leonardo DiCaprio shouts “I’m not leaving!”
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from films about Spider-Man, provided that both companies will pay half of the cost of producing paintings.
But that wasn’t Sony’s fault.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but stated, "We have worked well together over the past four years and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [of Spider-Man].
We are happy to be able to move forward together.”
The film “Avengers: Endgame”, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing in the history of world cinema, displacing Avatar from the first place.

The expert told why you should give up tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when brewing a bag of tea in a cup for five minutes gets more than ten billion particles of microplastics.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it can end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea by weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - the microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink there will be the least additives," the expert said.

The regions were invited to share the secrets of business support
On September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express his position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).
It’s time to establish interregional ties
The Committee of the Federation Council on economic policy summarized the information received from the regions about the programs of business development and legalization of self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
“To date, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by senators has identified the lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole,” said Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from the regions with proposals and issues (available to the editorial staff).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” the senator said.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate programs to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Center for Support of Entrepreneurship, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.
There is a cluster development center in the Oryol region.
The Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized businesses" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed are kept out of the shadows.
According to the regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “business activity”, since this “is most consistent with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo region, it is necessary to make amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for finishing and repairing residential premises, suburban buildings, and conducting physical training classes.
Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate the consolidation of the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and the directions of supporting social entrepreneurship in the regulatory and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills,” Andrey Kutepov assured.
The airline helped passengers to avoid the neighborhood with crying children

Now, if desired, the neighborhood with them can be avoided.
Passengers of the Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) have the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhood with young children.

Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the kids due to possible inconveniences associated with their crying, can stay as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline, were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago he was flying from New York to Doha, and next to him sat three crying children.
Another commentator proposed to introduce “flights only for adults”, expressing readiness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that now they will always try to choose Japan Airlines for their movements, since they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying child in a closed space.

As indicated in the report, the volumes of prohibited imports were compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import to Russia under counter-sanctions.
In the document posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the rules have been extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decree on the destruction of the sanction applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported into the country “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions have continued, the Russian Federation has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov earlier called the destruction of food “simply immoral”, and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption, in early June, was made by Rospotrebnadzor.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was made by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how to use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
The construction of the dome of the building, where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) telescope will be located, has officially begun this week, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total value, according to ESO, will exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and also look for Earth’s twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
