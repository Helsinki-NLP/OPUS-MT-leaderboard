Welsh additional MPs are concerned about what looks like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should change to that of "Member of the Parliament of Wales".
Deputies resented plans to change the name of the local assembly to the name "Parliament of Wales".
MPs of all political views suggest that this is some sort of deal.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues were concerned that it rhymed with the words "stupid" and "unreasonable".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "non-dareka".
The deputy said her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a short speech transition from a member of the Welsh Parliament to a "marionet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a law to make changes to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Assembly deputies call will, of course, be a question for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals, which found widespread support for calling the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of additional MP, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament of Wales or CUP, but the CUP option received the most support during public consultation.
Additional MPs obviously offer alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus may be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a change bill over the course of several weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the assembly, such as rules on disqualifying additional MPs and changes to the structure of the committee system.
Additional MPs will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called if they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters are voting to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a perennial issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, it has long been insisted that the name of their northern neighbor constitutes a claim to their territory, which prevented Macedonia from being included and friendly in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, a member of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a cost to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The bells of St. Martin's Temple are silent, the churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
"Earlier, as the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today there's neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different communications and attitudes at the moment," he said.
"Bars are no longer the huddled local living rooms where people go constantly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of the assets will not be seized for as long a period as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches," he added, "can be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help temples that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so it will speed up the day that these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who will move to these condominiums will become parishioners of these churches."
Both churches were built by a community of whites before Harlem became a black area - the Church of the Steel Community in 1870, St. Martin's Church - a decade later .
The original white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, which was praying nearby, was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black society led by the likes of John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of traders in the main trade in Harlem's 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but believers under Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the corral into operation.
The prodigal David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the corral "calling poor people."
An expert who played the carillon in July called it otherwise: "Cultural Treasure" and - "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by the black-skinned musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago .
Mr Meriwether said he had not been replaced at St Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been drawn by the church's false leaders, others by the diocese.
The congregation of the faithful — the governing body of the parish, consisting of the chaplain's assistants — wrote to the diocese in July warning that the diocese was "trying to shift the costs" to the congregation of the faithful, although the congregation was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobbyists in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming, asking for help, and then swam with the rest to help get him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just an excitement from catching lobbyists, but then he "realized something bad had happened: 'They were bitten!'
I've been bitten!"
"All his collarbone was torn," Hamel said, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I shouted at everyone to get out of the water, "In the water next to the shark!" added Hamel .
The boy was transported by air to the Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of shark that made the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victim sustained injuries to his upper torso.
The officials closed the approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablada to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety's sake.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in the department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of the significant promotion to the British beauty market with a turnover of ?2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the volume of fashion clothing and home goods sales will decline, larger beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year.
The investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space on shelves that used to be occupied by televisions, microwave ovens, and household goods.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the volume of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
Existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Large stores are also relaunching their line of boutique cosmetics, so that most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly demanded among young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will test the concession at Sainsbury's two stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydan in south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of products daily at local stores near the home leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupé, Sainsbury's executive director, said the trade points would be more and more like department stores because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's discounters, Lidl using more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, and has also placed several Habitats points since it acquired both networks two years ago, which it says has contributed to increased food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty departments and pharmacies did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's protested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split revenues from pharmacy stores ended after a series of supermarket fights.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business, along with 281 Celesio stores, to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds sterling three years ago.
Lloyds was said to have played a role in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have changed the look of our beauty salons to improve conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in training our employees to be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands are designed to cater to any needs, and the attractive furnishings and comfortable accommodation make us a better home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones rallied after Holly Willoughby gave up the 11 million pound sterling deal.
Dragons star Den Peter Jones has broken up after TV host Holly Willoughby turned down an 11 million pound deal with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There is no time in Willowby for a brand of goods for the home and accessories Truly.
The couple's business became similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Today morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with her lucrative branding business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones freaked out when a "golden" TV girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth up to 1.5 million pounds sterling would not be enough to make her take over.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was doubled to double Willoughby's fortune of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
Source reported: Truly was Holly's top priority.
This appeared to be her long-term future, which she will see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday was going to start lunch very soon.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the departure of the leading This Morning, which ranks among the most significant British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in various goods - from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as possible further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin were close with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby will become a representative of the M&S brand and replace this McPartlin as ITV's lead "I Am Celebrity".
Last night, a source close to Jones reported, "We will not comment on his cases."
A sincere conversation, "after which we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from media outlets for his comment, which he considers "unpresiding" for speaking positively of a North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump rejecting so much of what?
Trump said in his parade "dictatorial" voice.
"I don't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have gone into a deadlock.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Lee Yong Ho said to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not been expecting "appropriate moves" by the United States in response to North Korea's previous steps in the disarmament field.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We are building a very successful relationship with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended in war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a good relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: completing missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of American troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"Being on the president's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to infiltrate this crowded arena, we're already going to have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake at v. Lambock, foreign NGOs were told they were unnecessary.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lambock's population having been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for international aid to be provided.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult," Ms Sumbung said.
Though the Save the Children Foundation and gathers a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopa, a spokesman for the national agency for dealing with distress, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to find out whether international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia always experiences, the country is still well prepared for the troubles of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh, there are almost none in other coastal villages.
The apparent lack of siren to warn of a tsunami in Palu led to more casualties, although there was a warning.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And distressing disasters have complicated the logistics of the move.
A hospital vessel that was placed on the v. Lambock to treat earthquake victims is approaching Palu, but the path to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidoda focused his pre-election campaign on improving Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and spent money on roads and railways.
But lack of funding is haunting the Jock administration as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joka also faces the pressure of continued interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives embrace a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool pushes the ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, equalling the number on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Staridge received a transmission from Jerdan Shakira when they were about 30 feet from the Chelsea gate creation, which led 1-0.
He made a fint by the ball to his left before making a shot at a distant rod.
The attempt ended in a kill high under the top bar when the ball flew to the top right corner of the net.
The ball consequently flew over Kepa Arisobalogi's head, which jumped, directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get into this position to kick the ball, and players like Shake were always trying to kick as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," Starridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante running, made an easy pass without thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 early in the second half after Belgian star Eden Azar scored in the 25th minute.
Attacking the Blues in this match, he made a pass to Mateo Kovacic before returning to the half-back zone and running into half of Liverpool's field.
Kovacic quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
He then made an impact kick by passing the ball to Hazard at the gate.
Hazard ran around the defender and broke into the bottom left corner at the far bar past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool are battling Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Italian Naples.
Chelsea meet with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, the Disaster Relief Agency reported Sunday morning.
At a press conference, Sutop agency spokesman Purvo Nugroha said that according to reports, many people found themselves trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was bombarded with rubble from destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman.
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with knife wounds in the Grayson Muse area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people from the area to address them who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I'd like to reach out to anyone who was nearby John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also urge everyone, particularly taxi drivers, whose video recorders may have filmed some video, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today's event a friend of the woman came to the scene to ask: where was she found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several more hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer explained to one person that the entire area was now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, "It's so awful."
At 14:00, two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, and another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, exploring the multi-storey building.
All who have information should contact the police department of ?MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling entry 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue was the last century-old blow in the matter of "rewriting history".
His removal would be a poetic justice for his similar Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts perpetrated by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the current debate about the demolition of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near the Palace of Westminster would be the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a bad Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornicroft's vivid representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of a figure whom many believe to be worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell many have known since the late 19th century better than today, as a protector of Parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation, the subject of lengthy historical debate.
There is no doubt that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure representing one side of that clash.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored."
The pig-killer withdrew to the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
"A man known only by his surname, Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and blood flowing, next to a barn in Lupanshui Market in Guizhou Province," the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to introduce the swine vaccine into a pig feeder on May 30, 2005 in Sinin in China's Qinghai province.
He and his cousin reportedly came from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the nearby piggy bank was open.
He said that there was a big knicker in the piggyback with blood on the pussy.
According to the report, forensics confirmed that a 550-kilo knob had dislodged the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were covered and damaged," said a cousin from Wu's nickname (as quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
A video from the surveillance camera showed Yuan going into the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent an attack on anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people are rare, they have been before.
So, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife scared the animal off.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a downing hook.
"They're just gullible.
They're cuddly and very inquisitive...they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The Rose's speed, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. according to Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. When the Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical rain toward the south.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture, which interacts with the incoming area of low pressure, will in the coming days call forth strong torrents in the southwest.
In places between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall causes dangerous flash floods, mudflows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall in places to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in much of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Because of the ragged areas of tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible under the condition of rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out into the desert on foot because of the possibility of tropical rainfall threats.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by steamy wind and dust.
The upcoming low-pressure area will bring heavy rain in parts of the Southern California coast in places.
Possible total rainfall of more than half an inch can lead to a slight stream of garbage and make the roads slippery.
This will be the first shower of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature swings in the United States as temperatures get colder in the Arctic, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp changes in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of sharp temperature drops in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis, and Dae Moyne, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the continued summer heat will try to intensify and expand again.
Warm October is expected to begin in many central and eastern U.S. states with temperatures of 80 degrees, from the Southern Plains to part of the Northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearings.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched interesting witness testimony on Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that supposedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of the emergency news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunken Cavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull her off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company, you usually have problems evaluating people watching TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing the playoffs or Academy Awards.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, ran all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearings as well.
Flake was the main figure in the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican published a statement saying he would vote in support of Cavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at him for an address and when he tried to climb the elevator to a hearing before the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes lowered for several minutes as he was being lashed, and this was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, but many women are deprived of it."
Flake said his office had published a statement, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks ran a live broadcast for several hours when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the issue of selecting Cavanaugh's candidacy at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI was considering charges against the candidate next week, which is what minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several Senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to endorse Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of planning to leave the European Union that they were "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one interview alongside her on the first strip of the paper was her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "sharp" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal for the UK and the EC to have single fares was "totally flawed".
Murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect in LSU player Dytheon Simpson's death.
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
"20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and placed in prison on charges of second-degree murder," Baton Rouge police said.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
"Police took the glasses from the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them," reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to the fatal shot at Wade.
"The cost of the facility is set at $350,000," the Advocate reports.
An Eastern Baton Rouge investigation published a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force Department, the state police crime lab, Southern University Police are asking residents in the area for assistance in an investigation that would have contributed to the arrest.
University of Louisiana sports director Joe Allewa thanked the district's law enforcement for "ageing and striving for justice."
Sims was only 20 years old.
Attacking at 6 feet tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
He averaged 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, University of Louisiana basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "disturbed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Papacatepetl volcano reached southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday suggested Mexicans stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was detected and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
There was audible grump in the center and there was a push.
Images on social media have shown that there are thin layers of papyrus coating on car windshields around Mexico City, such as Sacchimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeast of the capital after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence supporters clashed with police over public order protection, and thousands of others joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of separatists in masks, restrained by police for public order, threw eggs at them and sprayed them with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the fighting broke out when police used their batons to deter demonstrators.
Within hours, groups of independence fighters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" were confronted by present trade unionists shouting, "Live Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen people underwent treatment for minor injuries sustained in the course of the protests.
Tensions in the region seeking independence remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was marked by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred independence, although voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the flight after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to follow a different path.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attends a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's independence prospects.
"We flew through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to keep momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who records a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he would be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Selecting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonders: Men arrested after ramming house on car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonder.
The incident occurred in the Belinagard-Cresent area on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was fired into the car.
As a result of Mang's strike, Livingston gets a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Mangy's first goal in favour of Livingston secured them a win.
Livingston's success stunned the Rangers, and this caught on to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Mangy's hit of Fate was excellent because Gary Holt had risen one level with Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team will not win on the road in the Premier League this season and will meet leaders next Sunday, the Harts team, who are eight points behind.
Prior to this, Rangers in the Europa League host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continued their unbeaten streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt still feels paralyzed after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances due to rude visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they killed, but this direction caused Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's blow.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
A penalty kick was allowed on the Rangers side, and Livingston went on to make their debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Menga, who made a pass and scored from midfield.
By this point, the Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that the team's defense was untenable, and goaltender Liam Kelly was practically unengaged.
The same continued into the second half, though Alfredo Marélas did save Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was deflected by Rangers goaltender Alan McGregor, and Lithgow far away from the second set of Livingston.
The balls continually hit the Livingston gate and were deflected, while two penultimate demands, after being called up by Halkett to replace Glen Middleton, and a penalty demand for the game by hand, were rejected.
Phenomenon from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alessair Lamant at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have not changed practically since their return to the senior echelon, but it is worth giving proper Holt for the way he has been stimulating the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grand, building a well-organized defense, while Menga held Conar Goldson and Joe Waroral all over the field.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match, they didn't own the ball, only scoring in the gate once, which was something of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who ended up in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdagan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles were seen and there were groundless summers when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They quarreled over human rights issues, press freedom, and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdagan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police were saved on security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect differences over the guest, who was declared a hero by one German Turks and condemned by others as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: Ravarist died in car collision
Ravarist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped, medical staff arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another rower died in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Steel police said their employees are working to identify the man and report him to their closest relatives.
There are roadside fences and bus stops near that site, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six employees injured during riots
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in a strict-regime prison for men," the Penitentiary said.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continue until now.
To combat the riots involving eight prisoners placed in one wing, a special group called the Tornada was involved.
At the scene, employees underwent treatment for minor injuries.
A spokesperson for the Penitentiary Service said, "Specially trained prison staff were sent to fight those who committed the riots at Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees underwent treatment after receiving injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Royal Long Lartin Prison contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was undergoing treatment in a hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, public order police officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots during which employees were attacked with swords for water polo.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix City, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which may be beneficial for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but this is exactly what may happen early next week because traces of Hurricane Rose remain in the southwestern part of the desert that form a risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already on Monday and Tuesday published data on flash floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Sol.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or drop in pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona state border."
The National Hurricane Center's latest model predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual locations having levels as high as 6 inches in the Magalion area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall between 1 and 2 inches, with individual resulting values reaching 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be a long-awaited one because their region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfall are likely to be useful because droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory is experiencing an emergency drought of the second category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to a landslide on Mexico's Lower California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the hurricane's power with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and so subside.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, there will be an exit of rivers from the coast during the day or on Monday evening.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall is expected to be between 3 and 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sanllra, where rainfall of up to 10 inches is possible," reports weather.com.
The Rouge will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical drop in pressure, which will then continue through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
"The major danger is expected from Rose or its remnants, these are very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the southwest desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and mudflows and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four attempted arrests of assassins
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Excelsior area of Midsamer Norton at around 4 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in a "stable" condition.
"A 17-year-old boy and both others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset districts," police said.
Police appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what had happened to advance further in their search.
"Cavanaugh is reeling from the Democratic Party's meanness and anger," Trump said.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the repeal of the Democratic Party's ruthless and offensive tactics," Trump reported at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffers from the subterfuge and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his election to the post.
Cavanaugh gave testimony before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually abused her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave indications during her prosecution hearings.
On Saturday, the President said that "on that day, the Americans saw a brilliant, qualitative and courageous character" by Kavanaugh.
"A voice in support of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most advanced experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service," he said to a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly saved Kavanaugh's election by talking about the importance of Republican turnout during the interim election period.
"Five weeks left to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he replied.
"That's why I fight for big candidates everywhere."
Trump disagrees that Democrats intend to "confront and obstruct."
"The first key procedural vote at Senate level on Kavanaugh's selection is expected to take place no later than Friday," a senior parliamentary assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of people affected is rising
"At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi," authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves six feet (18 ft) high were battling the shore in the twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately flee, and they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the Indonesian disaster relief agency's press secretary, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami has been pulling cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before hitting the shoreline.
According to him, some people only survived because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palou centres.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Management Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and collapsing, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The subsequent push continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's severe earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "widespread" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without news.
"The casualties and damage may be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, an area called Dongala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
Communication at Dongal "was completely damaged," Nugroh said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely disclosed for not reporting a tsunami in Palu, but officials say the waves came at the time the warning was made.
In amateur pictures published on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting out to people on the street warning of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell ashore, dragging buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, so authorities found it difficult to reconcile the rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first necessity.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vida planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed
That's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Danggala were successfully reaching the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in the razor hideouts set up in the courtyard of their office, on the way they saw scenes of devastation," Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses," he recounted.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups began grim actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auliya Arriani, press secretary for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government declares, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we will be able to open up to international aid, but this status is not yet available.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing without news hoped that their near-miracle ,would be among those who would leave the bleak storylines of the worrisome disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was released from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under ruins for two days, and next to her was her child's body.
Hendon Subandona, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"Being older in the field of paragliding I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told how hours after news spread among the paragliding community about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu members who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one greyhead rather than two blues.
"This means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Refilling Bancomats in Newport on Levy
"Early Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who was depositing bills at a ATM in Newport on Livy," the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money," wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man "runs out from behind Brink's worker" and steals the fur from the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not ascertain the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police by phone at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I am officially known as Kenny West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Just like the contraction of his current professional name West used to say that this word has religious significance for him.
I believe "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it's "you," West said earlier this year, discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So I - it's you, I - it's us, all of it - we
It's gone from "Kaney," which means "one," to just Ye" - a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former employee, Jay-Z, also handled without a connection and headline letters.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use army against peaceful residents
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel Lopez Abrador, vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the day of bloody reprisals against students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Abrador vowed "never to use the troops to subdue the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired a peaceful demonstration in the area, killing about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were entrenched throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador vowed to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those studying, thus opening up more free places in public universities.
"Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
US should double funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes more active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Li, an investor and machine intelligence specialist who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if there is no official MI strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
"A doubling of the budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in the MI area," Lee said.
"Double funding could double the likelihood that the next great achievement of MI will be in the United States," Lee said on CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of MI's most famous companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Melan University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated Atel's highest-ranking American player, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's robotics competition for front-end research projects in the field of defense, and asked if there would be one next to help identify the following visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants," Lee reported.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders; it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired lights from universities to work on MI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of MI," he said.
China's State Council released a next-generation machine intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Machine Intelligence Center, in which industry and science partners must participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Organization (NSF), it currently invests more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury, which sought to create the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not monitored the action for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would allow a ten-year dispute to be resolved with Greece blocking applications to participate in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory, and has vetoed accession to NATO and the EC.
In June, both governments struck a deal considering the proposed new name, but nationalist supporters say these changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would meet the 50 percent minimum required to hold the referendum.
The referendum vote question suggests, "You are in favor of NATO and EC membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a cost worth paying for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievskaya, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name will require more than two-thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was just 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Skopje's 62-year-old voter, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica, and his son Dusko voted for a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the country's name, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and laid out chairs in front of tents set by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want a union with heads raised, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that the NATO friendship would make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming number will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the result of "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future."
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's TV showed 57 percent of those polled planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum failure will be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-government government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City walks to the gates through all of Brighton's defenses
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton by a 2-0 victory for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero easily did so.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders before hitting an open field.
Then Aguero found himself among four green shirts.
He went around one defender and overtook several more on the edge of the Brighton field.
He then pushed a pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker first touch in the penalty gave the ball to Aguera, who used his right kick to get around Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan kicking into the right side of the net.
"Aguera has some foot problems," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that very moment."
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got this ball in the depth of Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sein made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far bar.
Attacking the Sky Blues pointed the ball into the net before it popped out the border.

Scherzer wants to play the "choice points" role against Rocky
After the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff competition, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But constantly competitive Scherzer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff consequences for the Rockies remaining in the lead after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The Rockies won at least a definite place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first division title.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will stack up so that the game is likely to be at the highest level of anything I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a ball in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, held a CPR session on Thursday and will be on Sunday for a normal rest.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president was indirectly saved on the situation around his choice of Supreme Court by Brett Cavanaugh, speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones — I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for the big candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're full of determination to regain power by using whatever means necessary, you see - meanness, meanness.
They don't care who they offend, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to him, Democrats intend to "confront and obstruct".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil, mean, backward and false."
He was saved on the Senate Judiciary Committee's earlier recognition of Senator Diana Feinstein's Democratic group, which received a loud evaluation from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you let the document escape?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect - it was a very bad nonverbal language - the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It is impatience with those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a number of MPs from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome — all to express their opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically fate similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A message on the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, said that "we want these meetings to be lucid and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, that's exactly what meetings were like on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not that and the promise of a "more good, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed there ever was one.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and each opinion is judged from that side of view whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously believed that I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions with which I would not have made any mention — on national security issues of the EU or one at a time.
Every time I speak publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — there's a tirade of insults on social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the center's policies, saying I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments aimed at me tend to be political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who encounter a stream of sexual or racist acts every day, but never evade.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is to normalize the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that holds different views, and with each "uncertainty" movement or rule change, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that has urged me not to fall for the spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government, which caused my schooling to fail, I have been trying to stand up for better public services for those in their most need - let it be the local resident or the government.
I have never hidden my political views, including in past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could get lost in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that when a country is headed for Brexit, which is detrimental to the household, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leaders of the Labour Party.
But really the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether it's Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of election cancellation will be there and political expediency will not prevent me from acting in your behalf.
Chris Leslie - MP of the Nottingham Eastern Party
Ayr-Melrows 38 - 17: Invincible Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat said the end result, but without a doubt, Air earned a triumph in this amazingly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
They now head the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just like their best chances of making them masters, coach Peter Murchy Merchant had every right to be pleased.
"We've still tried our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, Give due to Eyre, he dared more than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try, transformed by Fraser Clima, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealized try.
Klimov stretched Eyre's lead with a penalty kick before, right in the break, he scored and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Eyre in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Bogot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Not, which was sprained, and after a re-start, Aire moved on through Stafford McDowell's attempt, implemented by Clims.
Air, acting Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled try at the end of February pressure.
However, the masters returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for kicking the Clims off the penalty line, McPherson landed behind Aire.
Klimov realized his attempt, which he did again almost after re-starting, after Kyle Rowe got hit by David Armstrong in the penalty and sent flanker Gregory Henry to the field's fifth try.
The Still Game star is like, ready for a new career in restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is about to enter the hotel business industry after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series would be the last in the show series, and Kernan appears to be planning to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kernan was hoping to take part in "a thriving trade in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "Our Sea by Right" is painted.
Adjusting is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of the shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over 19th-century resources is still alive — as is the urge to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached a maximum summit in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on October 1 after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Rabert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the IC decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense negotiations, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is committed to negotiating a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Morales is Bolivia's charismatic president facing a controversial re-election fight next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and this will change little, even if it does.
The UN organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to make a decision on the territory of Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Chilean international law expert Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have thrown it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her, Morales' militant rhetoric has lost its remaining Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velte, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of differences with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political stronghold.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The regulation is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place until they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore .
Ree says it is an "insurmountable dream" for continued U.S. sanctions and objections against the declaration of an end to the war in Korea to ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not start significant disarmament steps at first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump demand a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive headwear on the way to the shops in your cities
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
Valentino and Thom Browne's designers presented a bunch of unusual headwear on the podium for their SS19 collection, which crossed expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has won the popularity of impractical hats whose designers have sent their faces to the podium.
A prominent feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat decorated with wide margins similar to feathers that filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included jewel-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tim Brown also showed a selection of wise-cracking masquerades - just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with sewn lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a diving rod with a tube and safety goggles, and the other resembled a molten ice cream cone.
And if you keep sticking strongly to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who believe in style predict that huge hats can break through into our daily lives.
Huge-sized hats follow on the heels to "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot-wide margins that can be seen in everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label for a very uncomfortable hat that was dissolved in social networks, contributed to another big face on the podium - a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag dressed in a swimsuit.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia acanthus and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has had a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for non-gabled accessories."
John Edward: Knowing languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain achievements in academic success, this continues from 2018 with another excellent exam result underpinned by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community beginnings.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a vivid reminder that we can't only hope for English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's latest exams, we see languages ranked first in league tables with the highest enrollment rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students reached a higher grade A in learning Chinese, while 72 percent were learning German, 69 percent were learning French, and 63 percent were learning Spanish, too.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will no doubt be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now chosen as a subject just like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons employers cited for difficulties filling vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising jobs requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
No matter which profession you choose, if you learn a different language, in the future it will become a real advantage if you have those skills for life.
The ability to contact directly people from other countries automatically puts multilingual people first among competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are still vital to the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference for Scotland's youth.
It must be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts Sunday in San Diego
Start waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play at the preseason opening Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James would likely play in limited minutes.
According to a practice that took place this week. James was asked about his plans for "six game preseason schedules".
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's performance time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a slew of campaign actions.
It is the first of five scheduled Trump speeches next week, including stops at friendly venues, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When confirming a vote on arrival at the polls to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking to bolster support for those in the running for the midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's performance begin tonight in West Virginia and how to view it on the Internet?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia on the Internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider a hearing this week on the candidacy to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, who has problems on the occasion of allegations of sexual harassment with an expected confirmation in the Senate vote within a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of these speeches is to help Republicans facing election in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at "activating the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter a tight pre-election season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today's action could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, reported Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team advances to fight to keep hopes alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four Saturday afternoons may have been exactly what you need for this Ryder Cup.
The pendulum of momentum that is being wielded is a completely contrived sports concept that players sincerely believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
Dic where would they say impulse now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now they have four, so I think we're going through this with a little momentum," said Jordan Sleep, spattering throughout the day.
Europe's advantage is, of course, four points ahead, and there are twelve more in the game.
Americans, Spitch says, feel that they have a slight uptick in the wind, and they have something to hope for, not least because of the shape of Speight and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Spite was lethal from T-shirts to greens and is an example.
These garish cries of celebration became increasingly loud as he lasted his round, and he sank a decisive kick to play in a four-field match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His kick, which allowed them to win the match on the 15th, was met with a similar cry, like one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out.
"You just have to get deeper and worry about your own match," Spiti said.
Each of these players has already left.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, the only players who have gained more points than Spait and Thomas are Francesca Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Maliwood" were the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
This is happening, and how their energy is like flowing to and from this stormy crowd, and it confirms that they are players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential win in Europe if the sun goes down on Le Golf National than Fleetwood.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
Talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief job on Sirgio Garcia, the hero of the morning buffet, when he was paired with Alex Norén.
Boggie and two doubles on the front nine plucked a Spaniard and a Swede to him, with whom they were never able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't follow, and how the strategy can change in one instant.
Europe has so far become a better team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the U.S. team is eager to fight, which some have questioned, especially in the States.
Europe enter Ryder Cup final with 10-6
Europe will get a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Frances Malinari marked the fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the results in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in an effort to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, reigned in the U.S. dissatisfaction agency this morning, winning the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in a four-ball match, winning two matches, but they failed to do more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Furik's side needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, and he and Mallinari, who was named Mollywood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they magnificently braced themselves to beat down Woods and American rookie Bryson DeComb by another 5 and 4.
Woods, who spent himself through two matches on Saturday, showed a random splash of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-ball matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rouse, resting on x four-ball matches, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the four-ball games to para 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkij are ranked one and two in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time main winner Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas set up a two-point checkpoint for the Americans.
They scored a 2 and 1 victory over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in the four-ball matches and returned later to beat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team come back from a four-point deficit going alone, although the Furik owners only need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they will get everything.
North Korea says "no way" will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations was continuing sanctions that increase distrust of the United States, and in such circumstances the country could not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping testing at nuclear and missile sites, dismantling the nuclear test zone, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"One thing we don't see is an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way to disarm ourselves in the first place."
Despite Ri republishing Pyongyang's usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea was rewarded as it took incremental steps, his statement proved significant in that he did not deny one thing.
Ri was saved on a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", with Trump promising to give security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on 'denuclearization' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes 'an end to the war'," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is the unfathomable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. chief noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the denuclearisation issue had been South Korea, not the United States, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have become such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly saying that targeting the U.S. continent using North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President Evil" Trump called Kim a "rocket man"-self.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there would still be a lot to do, and sanctions should remain in place until the pair are denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing in the UN. The Security Council said Pyongyang should be rewarded for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompea told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be actively and unconditionally pursued until we are sure of a complete, final and complete denuclearization."
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006, trying to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the Security Council's colloquiums. the General Assembly then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeio has visited North Korea already three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress made with North Korea within hours of talks ended with a visa application stating that he was imposing demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to eliminate the missile installation and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said that according to Kim, the "appropriate measures" he expects are a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take a course on proper rest.
Harvard University's new course this year should encourage students to sleep more, and has the goal of fighting the culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a speech on the impact of lack of sleep on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, "Why was I told this just now, in the last course of study?"
"She said nobody ever told her about the importance of sleep - it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course taught by a student explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were often sleep-deprived within a week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section has an image of a room on the internet where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects sports performance, as well as the importance of habits before bedtime.
At the onset, participants are told how years of sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know this will not instantly change students' behavior.
But we believe they should know this as much as everyone knows about the health consequences of smoking," added Professor Chaisler.
According to him, the culture of nightlife still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be an increasing problem.
"Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be the students' 'secret weapon' to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid being overweight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studies chemical and physical biology, assisted Professor Chaser in developing the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to educate everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all undergraduates to complete a similar program of study before entering university.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students be able to set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful consequences of "blue light" being emitted from monitor screens and LED lights that can change the day-to-day mode that causes problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga kills Gerard's goal.
The Rangers suffered another injury when Dolly Mangy's goal assured Steven Gerard would not get a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Aibrax wants to record his first win on the way to a 4–1 triumph in February at St John's, but Gary Holton's team is already carrying Gerard's second streak as manager of 18 games to leave his side eight points behind the leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, didn't look as if they were clogged with paralysis.
At the same time as Rangers drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, with Hibernians remaining behind with a difference in balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after forward Colum Spence has to be treated for a head injury after he has an item thrown from the stand.
Gerard made eight player changes, which is why Ira did not play in the Batfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy under 11, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they were going at every step around their opponents.
The Rangers were more in possession of the ball, but Liwigston made more attempts to kill the ball.
They were to be killed within two minutes when the first time Mengy directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gate, and then the midfielder used that chance.
Jacobs Cagan's successful penalty kick was scored by Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to deliver a strong kick from behind.
The Rangers seized control, but in the last third of the game, they were more likely to kill than demonstrate a good game.
Alfredo Marélas certainly had to be punished with a fine a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lawles faced off in the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Columbia's complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit the gate in the first half of the game, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly almost gave up a goal to Lasan Coulibaly and an effective attack by Ovi Echiria.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute Livy may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to the bowlers a good game.
Again, the Rangers failed to break through the Jacobs gate.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for an opportunity to be killed at the gate.
Gerard substituted for Ryan Kent in Coulibaly's break, and this had an effective effect when the attacker broke through to Marellas, but an impressive Kelly ran in and blocked the kick.
But Livingston continued to delight visitors by playing the game they liked, and Lithgow and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long opposition.
Holt's side could only prevail in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to oppose the Jacobs before Litgov went on the bench.
Rangers replacement Glen Middleton happened another time after being fined when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter.
This page is from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLYKI... the day of the future physicist Ian Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radio activity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Called the Carnade, in which those seemingly under-represented scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: Who is he on the ground?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that are given away by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say it's really shaking now"?!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system "see" cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system "see" bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine kind of teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
The cells can then "see" the protein common in many cancer cells and then reintroduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was injected with a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear within 18 months.
The method involves getting immune cells into the patient, changing them in the laboratory so they can "see" the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then re-entering.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight cancer of the breast, ovaries, lungs, and colon," Professor Berazofsky said.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "learning" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a debate in support of Trump, bearing the title of MAG, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening Saturday evening, Kanye West was sacked after a performance where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would balk at a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening, titled City Ghost, when he was in the "Make America Great Again" hat, he spoke out against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked to white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show featuring the lead role of Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee while considering the sexual assault case of Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite the performance not being broadcast, West's words popped into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to get rid of West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They got excited over me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap.
They got excited over me.
"And then they say I'm in a geeky place," he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Want to see a giggle place? "Talking about what he" would put on my Squirrelman cap, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Due to his statements, the hearings were withdrawn on at least two occasions, and SNS representatives were embarrassed by the message from Veraiti. "The whole studio has shut down".
West was adopted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA's Conservative Party head, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But lead talk show Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art', which I believe is embracing and promoting an ideology that is hurting my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially called Kenny West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and he followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg called Snoop Lion's cradle and, of course, a music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a restaurant in eastern Belfast attacked a second man on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamor, police reported.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the State Attorney's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington was captivated by idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his swinging sword and for his role as John Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones' medieval raw material fight.
But the 31-year-old actor received a stereotypical macho hero, which means that young boys are often felt tougher to respect.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said that he thought "something happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the ?MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" roommate, Rouse Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he feels strong about solving this problem.
"I feel like a personally strong guy - when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?"
Keith believes that television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very male characters.
He continued, "What lies at the beginning and why is it taught?
Why study on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel like they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions of our time — how are we going to change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series would end, and he would step out of the battleground of the series and would not make docs or sequels to Game of Thrones.
From November, Keith will begin to revive the Real Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a burglar.
Recently, the actor reported that he considered meeting his wife, Rose, the best opportunity to complete the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who is in love with Keith's hero John Snow in this fantasy series awarded "Amy".
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Manor in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"One number of such people who contracted HIV infection through blood transfusions has dropped to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still prevalent.
Because of conservative values in the country, approximately 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread from lack of knowledge and sexual contrast.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has vowed universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies data leak, danger and conspiracy theory by her MPs
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters dropped charges on Saturday that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that there were claims against members of the super-right wing and their websites.
"Lies, lies, and a lot of disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Meaning Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capital Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court member Brett Cavanaugh appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to the Waters office and shared information with a Waters team member," reports Hill.
"This allegation is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"The member of my team whose data, personal information, and security were compromised as a result of these shunning and false accusations was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal causes anger," Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that she does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They don't have to lead themselves outrageously.
They should not question the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and agreeable.
Fleischer compared the reaction of the Waters to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navarro, the Republican Party candidate who votes and participates in the midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's a cut if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these false allegations.
"We guarantee that the perpetrators will be found," she continued, "and they will assume legal responsibility for all their actions that are disruptive and dangerous to any of my team members."
Johnny English Strikes Again review strikes fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It has now become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British twist, and that twist seems to be in Johnny English's comedy and action franchise, which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title "The Rebirth of Johnny English".
Will the satire be able to express itself well about how obviously mindless we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to make a mockery of things - his name was louder than all the comic faces he had done for non-English viewers in cinematography.
He is known to be a secret agent who, despite his wise-minded claims to glamour, turned out to be a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's features and a little taco guy who contributed a single note to the Choir of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character was originally based on the wandering and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barkleycard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are a few nice moments here that weren't there before.
I loved Johnny English, who is approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval advances, and the rotor blades knock a little on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but humor is felt weakly, and so it is surprising especially when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Unfulfilled confidently offer comedy as the main part.
Humor feels as if it's not just for adults, but for children as well, and even Johnny English's mindless mishaps are not as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in Bean's face.
A perennial current predicament is the UK's serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of a state agent - this is unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed-minded man who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Tereza-May, but there's nothing like it in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be revealed, she will have to engage some of those already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, things get complicated: he now works as a sixth teacher at several chic institutions and gives lessons on how to be an undercover operator: some good examples here, as English offers the Academy of Music lessons on espionage.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Boe currently has a marriage tied to the submarine commander, a role that Vicky Pepperdine performed a little in vain.
So Batman and Robin get horribly wrong things at the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman named Volga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister gets a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve the problems with UK hackers: with the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their action with immediate things: disguise themselves as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board a luxury yacht Volta; English commits pure anarchy because he tries to use the headset of virtual reality at home.
All moments are drawn for the last event, but are just as pleasant and noisy, in which there is quite a bit of a kid in the TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I couldn't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being drawn up to pay the British for a four-day work week with pay as low as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party should consider a radical plan if the British only work four days a week, but they are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to hand over to workers the results of the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was seen that the employees of the future would enjoy the three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The trade union convention approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times, "A planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea that is in line with the views in the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy to the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspirations of the Labour Party as a whole are not supported.
A Labour Party spokesman said: The four-day work week is a non-party policy goal, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonell said he had decided to take power back from "biased directors" and "monagers" to utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also suggest that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire package of shares because the Labour government may make a "calculation" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to bring workers to the boards of companies and create joint property funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's own funds to workers who will hold annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for "60 Minutes" that an FBI investigator working with Kavanaugh must change his mind
An FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his selection to the Supreme Court for at least a week.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Palley asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about "The Meaning": whether the FBI could reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy proved more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said, going to the courthouse: I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked about the cause of the charge, asking, "Did you do that?"
He was decisive and unambiguous."
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Cavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And everyone she calls hasn't been able to believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the International Festival: an annual music event that has a very impressive lineup of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on a large Central Park lawn, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, as well as learning about the event's true goal of ending poverty and ending the 2030s.
The International Festival of Citizenship, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the scourge of an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a number of tasks either to "do the action", be a volunteer, email the country leader, call any other person and raise awareness.
But how successful was the Civic Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a costless concert a real way to convince people of the need for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" - people feel like they're doing a good thing by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organizers say they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters seeking to achieve various goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to meet commitments to account for more than $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with UK-based investors and executives to "help children develop in full", and promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can redress the social injustice of malnutrition in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling for better food for moms and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a "food aid" project that reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website, "what makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival responded: It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will suffer the paralysis and failure.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are one of a number of Pearsons performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use Navy for 'blockade' to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
"Washington can, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EZ and Middle East markets," said U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink said that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it is acting to invite legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to acquire energy just like they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to assure the openness of the sea lanes, and if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy will not hit the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less equalizing and replacing fuel," he said, calling Russia "one-sided country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its imported natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration workers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump agrees has turned Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline at a cost of $11 billion, which is being created to bring the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to this project is taking a start in the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the only view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans received a kickback from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
A major German organization representing industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrialists Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at Halioki City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
"It's time for women to head to Washington and sort out our failing government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will be very seriously considering the possibility of running for president."
During a speech at the mayor's office, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh.
On Friday in her tweet, Warren wrote "of course, you need the FBI to conduct an investigation before you vote."
However, the poll results published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Center for Policy Studies, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be bothered.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Devall Patrick, where 38 percent were in favor and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats discussed in relation to potential balloting in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont State Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially take the decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned Trek Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder
The 26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called up for service in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What my son is going through after he returns, I can compare to the results of post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with, in other families," she said at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest a "ball issue" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, "return a little other, hardened, come back with the question of whether there is that respect that soldiers, pilots, other military men fought for, giving themselves back to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of an attempt to report domestic violence, wearing a gun in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, the press secretary of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new policy to provide a haven
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a challenge to new U.S. policy denying refuge to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support a challenge to the policy of providing a shelter, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his friends from the brutal gang" raped her, but U.S. authorities denied her bail on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which the largest number of requests for refuge in the United States come, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Reisin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislative experience by states, countries, and the world."
"The federal legislature requires that applications for the dock be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and a similar change violates this principle," says the analytical note.
Lawyers also said in a note that policies that deny immigrants are hurting the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and "create the jobs they need."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Residence is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," said Sessions on June 11, announcing this policy.
The refuge has never meant solving problems, not even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. During the attempts to find those who survived, the number of deaths doubled
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very stressful," says Rice's 35-year-old mother Kusuma, calming her little son to a temperature in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute a car 'quickly' brings in bodies.
Clean water is very little."
The residents began to return to their shattered homes, parsing the wet stuff, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Army Palu Hospital, where patients are treated in the street due to strong shocks that recur.
There were tears in his eyes as he recalled feeling strong underground jolts in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was squeezed under the ruins of a wall," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town for marriage.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'threats' using 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in the American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid addition of China Daily to Des Moines Register - the state's most-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election. This is an accusation China refutes.
Trump's accusation that China had tried to interfere in the American election marked what American officials in a conversation with Reuters called a new phase in Washington's pressure campaign on China.
Though placing ads by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have now unleashed a trade war that has resulted in mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts said, have been imposed to hurt exporters such as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in the author's article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by printing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, there you will find there are not so many votes against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron Fifth Communist Party," he said.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused the offer" to print his article, though he did not name that newspaper.
Republicans push back on women voters ahead of midterm elections from Kavanaugh's fiasco, warn analysts
While many prominent Republicans are defending top judge Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual violence charges, analysts have warned that they will receive a hit in return, especially from women, during future midterm elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans already show that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be brought back," said Grant Rihar, a Maxwell Syracuse University School of Political Science professor of publishing The Hill for an article. which was printed on Saturday.
Rihar said he was not sure Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)'s statements about the investigation by the FBI would be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow and in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn newspaper from Washington, D.C., said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Cavanaugh, despite a statement by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be extremely big," said news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can also be even higher, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president but often don't vote."
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual violence against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong hit in response.
"For the Republican Party, it made some kind of mess," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party's National Committee at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee voting or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh will get into office. It's about how Republicans handled it and how they put it before it," noted news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it is similar to the fact that Americans are divided in the matter of whether Ford or Cavanaugh is right, with a little more in favor of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents would definitely or not very definitely trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they would definitely or not very definitely trust Cavanaugh.
In addition to this, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in their statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push by Flake, the FBI is investigating charges by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh, when drunk, had sought her as a 17-year-old.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate demonstrated her genitals at a party when they were studying at Eyle in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world network plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee Solid's open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and who has permission to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that, in creating Inrupt, he meant "to dominate the world".
"We need to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "own data warehouses on the Internet" or PODs.
This can contain lists of contacts, lists of cases, calendars, faneks, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available at once on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this "personally enhancing potential with data."
According to the company's executive director John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the ability to bring together the resources, process, and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, several developers working on the contract project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not complete changes if all their business models were instantly reviewed.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Honoring the priest awarded by the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack under Belengliz and Leacourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper bullet and never learned that he had won the highest military British award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren at the parade unveiled a commemorative stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone would open exactly 100 years after being awarded to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through a thick implosion and under heavy rifle and machine-gun fire from the enemy."
He then ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, capturing the cannon on his own and knocking out three units.
Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, and a little over a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather's actions were "something I would never be able to do and also something worth respecting."
He and his brother Dr. James Wang also staged a wreath after the parade, which was headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the manhood of the true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many provide."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, they got Pep's pig instead
Just imagine, you've stood up all night to watch a packed transmission from Bellator 206 and then you're denied a view of the main event.
There were 13 fights in the program from San Jose, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on British TV channel Channel 5.
And at six in the morning, when Gerard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were just stunned when the program changed to Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night specifically waiting for this fight.
One of the cheerleaders on Twitter called switching to baby multyk as "somewhat silly joke".
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications said, "According to a state regulation at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and we needed to switch to a children's program."
"Yes, Pep's Pig."
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said that in the future they would work on the program to take British viewers into account.
"I believe that we will discuss the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, we can resolve this issue," Cocker said.
"But now it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to resolve this until Sunday by now, which is Monday by their time.
But we're doing our best.
Believe me, when the programs were memorized, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to resolve the issue by thinking it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state ordinance.
Magoo will promise that next time it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to tip the fans off, but we overdid it.
It's an embarrassing situation."
'Disks of a deserted island': Tom Daley felt 'insignificant' because of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley said he grew up with a feeling of insignificance for others because of his sexuality - but that gave him motivation on his way to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discs of the Desert Island" program in lead Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional host of this rather old Kirsty Young program, she took a break for several months due to illness.
In the role of the man who ended up on a deserted island, on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a child he felt "less" than everyone else because "the community didn't accept those whom both boys and girls liked."
He said, "I still believe that this feeling of not being like everyone else and being insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist of the Olympics has become a significant LGBT activist and at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia has called on countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man — an American screenwriter, director, and presenter named Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "it was unexpected to me."
Daley married Oscar's owner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he says the age difference doesn't matter.
"When you go through this at such a young age" - at the first Olympics he got to be 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer - he said it was difficult to find a rover who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son's name being Robert Ray Black Daly, and Daly said his "perspectives have changed completely".
"If you asked me last year, I'd tell you I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Roby is my Olympic gold medal."
His son is also called as his father, Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked if they had bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics was he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be sitting in the first row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't immortal," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that that's what I've been dreaming about all my life - jumping into the water before my ballplayers at the Olympics, that's the best feeling," he said.
It also influenced the song's choice - Proud by Heather Small - which found echoes in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are now running.
"Disks of the deserted island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summertime.
Mickelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47 match in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get his form back so this event doesn't get unlucky.
Mickelson, who will play in this biennial competition, a record 12th time, team captain Jim Furick has landed on the bench for Saturday's foreballs.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time cup winner divided his days between cheerleading and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the challenging Le Golf National field, where hard-hitting kicks are severely punished.
And if the field itself isn't gloomy enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will be fighting against the exact British Open champion Frances Malinari, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of 12 singles matches, start with success, a Michelson match can prove extremely important.
Furik expressed confidence in this player, but could not say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, attracted me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He's very confident in himself.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and gave very many teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two games.
I planned more, but it worked that way and that's how we thought we were going to play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
In Mickelson, 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brought the team benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to joke over people and just a very good person to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players were pleased to pair him up with jokes, also this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large breakout can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the individual last day's Ryder Cup games can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderam, where the European team led by Seva Balesteras had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but finished with a minimum advantage of 141 to 2-131 to 2.
"Constantly remind yourself that at Walderham we had a big advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost," said Bjorn after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday, and yesterday, and win 10-6 at the National Lef.
"History shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not the end yet.
Tomorrow you have to play for all one hundred.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Until the points appear in the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and it's an attempt to win this trophy, that's what we're going to focus on.
I'm constantly saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that there are the best players in the world on the opposite side."
Satisfied with the way his players played on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
There will be individual games tomorrow, and that's quite another thing.
It's just great if you're on the field with your partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing alone, then this is where your true galfist talents come in.
Here's what you have to bring to the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave the partner, the pits have to go and also show the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furick hopes for a better individual game by his athletes than the one they demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word of it," he said, responding to a question as Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain set his players up for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but always want to have a quick start that you've seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
As the speed grows, the greatest pressure is exerted on those who play matches in the middle.
We made the appropriate schedule and put the players in the way we liked. You know, tomorrow we're trying to get a bit of magic."
Thomas was given the task of starting to play back and plays against Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rouse, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play against the top golfers.
"I put my players in that order because I think I'll shut everything down like that," Bjorn said of his choice for individual matches.
The descent of the new German warship is postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy was due to enter service in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to failing systems and ever-increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The descent of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the absolutely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as the Die Zeit newspaper wrote, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to enter service in 2014, but problems that emerged after construction hamper this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships ordered back in 2007 are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics are longer periods between maintenance - newer frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, ongoing delays mean that modern battleships - which may allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country - will become obsolete by the time they finally enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have written about the many "defects in software and hardware" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships only have 120 sailors - half the crew of old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is double the weight of ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to missing equipment, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - although at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems accumulating with the new frigates are made particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's sea power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, said the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions."
He stated that the problem was increasing over time because old ships were being written off and there were no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Monument Conservation Society overheard the secret life of bats
A new study being conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by scientists from the National Monument Conservation Society of Scotland is done by small bats and also by the stormy long-eared Dobanton bats in the Inverew Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this area to monitor bat actions during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all records determine the frequency of bat calls, as well as what bats do.
A residence map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the National Conservation Society, hopes the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals to live in.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developer work affecting and destroying their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, also like sticky ribbons for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
Spoken is not blind at all.
However, because of their nightlife, bat ears are more audible than eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in the way of flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check residences and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish bat sanctuary at the Three's estate in Dumfries and Galaway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
Property manager David Thompson says it's the perfect territory for bats.
"Here, in Triv, we just have a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for the presence of bats before undertaking an asset repair, as it is possible to unintentionally destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 females and young bats, leading to the complete destruction of the local population.
Everyone is under guard and they are prohibited from killing, frighting, restless, or destroying their saddles.
Elizabeth Fairall, an employee of the Bat Protection Organization in Scotland, urges the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and many of the species we don't even know how to live their populations."
Ranaldo is facing rape charges, and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Kristian Ranaldo called his rape charges "fake news", saying that people want to "advertise themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
The forward of the Portugal and Juventus national team was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 for the silence, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ranaldo addressed 142 million of his subscribers hours after the charges were published, calling the message "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball owner in front of the camera.
"They want to make an ad in my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Ranaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel magazine over the charges, which they called "an unsubstantiated report of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player would demand compensation for "moral damage in an amount that corresponds to the difficulty of the violation of rights, and in recent years it is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Howtel and Casino Hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Meeting at Ranaldo and Mayorgo's nightclub would be like going back to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as written in Clark County District Court documents in the state of Nevada.
Mayorgo claims that Ranaldo then conjured up and said that at "99 percent" he was a "good guy" who was suffering from "one percent".
The documents state that Ranaldo admitted they had sex, but with the consent of the parties.
Mayorgo also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage in the hospital, but then agreed to a bail settlement because she was "very afraid of revenge" and she was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reopen the charge because she feels a moral injury for that case.
At the time, if there was a place for this case Ranaldo was going to move to Madrid Real from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will 'forever regret' losing carmakers
The UK will "forever regret" losing its status as the world's automotive leader after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was "unhappy" with Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at a plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays on the border as a result of Brexit without an agreement could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Bernaston - where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be carried out if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. These include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that carmakers are talking about the risk of supply chains resulting from Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border that will lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply of parts at the Derby plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Clark's spokesman said Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" on future relations with the EU was "made exactly so as to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will allow not only the success of today, but also allow us to take advantage of that opportunity," he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, suggests that we should be able to continue to operate successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how long the production would last, but for the future warned that the added cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the trade union coordinator, said trade union members are very concerned: "By my reckoning, if jobs are cut, they won't recover anymore.
The government's press secretary said, "We have proposed an accurate plan for our future relationship with the EU that deserves to be trusted."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" while fighting around Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies election interference by Russia, Trump associates' ties to Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
To fire Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus put Mueller's independence at risk, has been fueling the fire of Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted this.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump, who was at UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a confrontation at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further slowed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday's Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date is not yet set, perhaps this week, maybe next. I believe that rather, a week later, taking into account all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information."
Some journalists are ready to challenge her claim: Sanders has not conducted press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Programme host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings is not caused by disrespect for TV reporters who "work for the public," though she added, "I agree with the fact that they work for the public."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more meetings with answers to press questions than any president that was before him," she said, adding without specific facts, "We have studied these numbers."
Briefings are taking place, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, at which you can ask a question directly to the president, will replace briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
Press conferences by the president himself are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagant, he appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system before Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from the EU working in Scotland's health system to express gratitude on behalf of the country and wish that they would remain after Brexit as well.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of living applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on our country's exit. They are leading to pending decisions this fall.
But the British government was also quick to prepare for a no-agreement scenario.
I know it's a very troubled time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers team's linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in a Sunday match that his team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player's injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He switched to the sideline and suddenly fell," Reid said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercombi oxygen while still in the field before putting it on the force and undergoing a diagnosis to establish it.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no "details on what it was about the injury," and Tennessee State is trying to detect if the player has been injured.
Abercombie, a second-year sportscaster, spends the first season behind Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving a total of 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay more duty
Under the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher tax, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in state duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters as well as affordable housing.
The increase in state duty is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing homeless program.
Raising the current state duty, including higher levels adopted two years ago, to buy second homes and housing for hire, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to receive up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents of the United Kingdom, this leads to higher prices and new buyers find it difficult to buy their first home.
Many of the country's rich regions - especially the capital - have become "ghost cities" because a large number of buyers from abroad reside outside the UK most of the time.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce state duty for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping real estate prices high by seizing land and not using it, and called on Mrs May to abolish affordable housing quotas in order to direct the "disgraceful housing situation" in Britain.
Spadar Corbyn announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including controlling rents and stopping "irresistible" evictions.
He also wants to transfer more powers to the local council in the areas of housing construction.
Mrs May said: "Last year I stated that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - life for every new generation should be made better.
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that individuals not residing in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as UK workers.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly elusive, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run the Scottish constituency"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his main ambition is to ever become the coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the first.
He moved on to this job in the summer, after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," Ross said in the BBC Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
"I grew up often sick for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, such an opportunity will come if I am a successful club coach."
Among Ross's predecessors are Sunderland coach Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye, and Paula di Canya.
Former coach Aloa Athletic says he felt no fear of such famous names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now success for me will be the answer to the question 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club his place is definitely in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I will only consider my job a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa return from the third league and turned Saint Miren from a loser who almost got into the Championship in the winner of the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his work at Aloa, he said that "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds incredible because I've worked well, earned well, and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I still go through it when I talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing it now, and for me it's the best time of my adult life."
The full interview can be listened to on Sportsound's programme on Saturday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summertime
According to the study, the ideal time to drink a pint of beer is 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but brought pressure to bear on restaurant networks.
According to statistics, a group of pubs and bars noted a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but in restaurants, the volume of sales fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA advisory business group that collected this statistics, said: "Continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of the English national team in the World Cup final means that in July there was still what happened in June, when sales increased by 2.8 per cent.
The decline in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks have so far shown the best result as opposed to restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food also baked in the sun, though not as heavily as restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages rose 6.6 percent, and sales of food fell three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and accommodation issues said, "These results are being made by a trend we've seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle because sales have fallen 4.8 percent in a year, which is very frustrating when costs are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the most difficult time for operators who are focused on food, and time will show whether lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployments.
The sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars, and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is an important landmark in this field.

A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid rise in "fake Insta" accountancy - which is as if leading to an Instagram photo sharing site.
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they run "clean" "basic" accounts to show to their parents, and also run private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, learned that they had called on others to "rape me".
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of independent school principals (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles each, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the internet where neither their parents nor their teachers will find them."
Eileen Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Council
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer member of the council at that body's annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the event as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to gain many benefits from her experience at a variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
"Eilide enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sporting community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit a lot from her work in the council," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can help guide the sport in Scotland."
An American who won gold at the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert on the BBC, cannot walk after surviving a microstroke.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will correct myself and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and now I'm doing an aftercare exercise!
Thank you for the messages of support!"
An advertisement for a baby pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions online
A campaign to produce baby pumps has divided opinions by producing an ad that compares nursing women to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is called the "world's first wearable baby pump", consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music commercial based on the video to show the freedom that this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a pigtail with cows under the song, where there are such words as, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "On occasion, if you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my chest."
And I sang, "Dai, dai, I feed my children, dai, dai, I give my women."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a heated discussion online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments.The reaction to the video was mixed, many said it was a horror of small-scale production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to graze and give birth to milk, here's just their children being picked up in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's baby pump hides unobtrusively in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a baby pump for a mother in which children are not taken away?"
Someone added, "Such an unthinking ad."
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was "fun".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd like to have one if I were breast-feeding.
Sucking milk makes me feel cowish.
It's an ad a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a genius product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very entertaining ad aimed at a mother sucking milk pump (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and hearing herself "cows".
This advertisement does not endorse or condemn the small-scale industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with invisible baby pumps hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use baby pumps feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no truths, no pipes and hides undetected in a bra for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children and even leaves the house while the device is in operation.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, remarked, "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milk sucking and its difficulty, while simultaneously demonstrating in an entertaining and agreeable way how a new milk pump would bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
This is not the first time Elvie's baby pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium wearing clothes from Martha Jakubowsky, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without excessive noise are transported to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, partly due to the tough rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump administration that have hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are immigrant illegals who are wary of endangering their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
Risks rose significantly in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other full-time household members would need to file fingerprints and data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, spoke before Congress with a report on the arrests by an agency of dozens of people who were asked to sponsor minors without escort.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had previously had no convictions.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and much of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we continue to persecute such people," Mr Albens said.
For faster handling of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, with the former standard term being 60 days, according to orphanage workers.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status as an immigration judge will have to use video communications rather than being present in court in person.
Those who are treated with no reason to be helped are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children remain in prison, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers state that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are found to be much stronger, as signs that the child is in a hot state are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a hint town without providing time for emotional training or to say goodbye to friends can make the injury worse, which many have already faced.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of 'occupation forces' of US, France and Turkey
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war continuing in the country for the eighth year.
Muallem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and without putting any conditions," he said at an Assembly meeting.
Muallem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have had to abandon their homes, the "war on terror is virtually over".
He reported that Damascus intended to continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
Syria is home to about 2,000 U.S. troops, who mainly serve as instructors and advisers to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's ground contingent in this war-torn country is over 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for return were favourable and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that hold refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he says.
"They are politicizing an exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces supported by Russia into the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "exact deadlines", and expressed hope that the military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would "be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first sittings of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, in order to draft a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem expressed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and cautioning against interference.
Why Trump will go on a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will not end his presidency prematurely.
And it will no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of the presidency in all of history!"
There are no signs of viewer fatigue at this point.
Since 2014, primetime ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and the channel's "The Rachel Maddow Show" aired 3.5 million viewers at the screen and crossed cable TV ratings ahead of the evening.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because we don't understand it," says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama Breaker, about a Cabinet member who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scovell, a masquerading comedy screenwriter and author of "A Couple of Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys Club," there is another theory.
She mentions a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
- Why? she asked.
He replied, "Because he cheers me up," Ms. Scowell told me.
Chaos is also valuable in that it can be comforting.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington can become as defining a future as the Rove v. Wade case, depending on whether immigrant families are reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch Trump's sixth hour framed by a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "information not for print" in the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket with edible skin (a garment strewn with pride, as written in The Washington Post), the implications of that are stark.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"Part of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show he demonstrates every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars. ("Stars as pawns") about the changing cast of the show.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll get away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleas this week, behind the windows of his home on the north bank of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not fail, not when Brett Cavanaugh stood up before the Senate Judiciary Committee discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging on his hair.
"I remember the Thanksgivings when we were producing these crazy shows, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleas told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

External cash flows pour into tough pre-election race of midterm elections to the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district was covered by a cash-strapped gubernatorial due to a change in the boundaries of the districts introduced by Congress, causing two candidates to participate in elections for one seat.
The recently redrawn suburban area of Pitzburg surrounds a Democrat, House of Representatives member Conar Lamb, who won his seat in another district at a by-election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in campaign funding by major party finance groups, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (CCDC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory at a widely acclaimed dowry in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts argue that Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of El Salvador being punished for supporting China, and then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing's position despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," State Department press secretary Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted restrictions on the issuance of visas, would hurt Central America's country with its high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings concluded, representatives from North and Central America postponed holding a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would have continued a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigration from the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively stop considering El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pension will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favor of holding the event.
And three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while maintaining anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by other, close to administration analysts who also wished to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, examples of which there is currently very heavy evidence in documents of a public nature.
Mr Mueller is reported to have drawn attention in the investigation to the possibility of a Trump campaign and Russia plotting to attack the election.
If Congress changes the landlord, Mr. Trump will find himself facing responsibility before that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps ultimately, to jurors from among his colleagues.
There are many "ifs", and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, just like his peers in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History spins around similar turning points, and the incalculable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, Americans are facing a few of these tipping points.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a difficult position since writing in the paper that last year he suggested secretly writing down the president's words and pondering his profligacy.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' recount is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's case is not all-encompassing or fair, or if it is approved in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual violence and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in an election for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, a long winter will come for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak gubernatorialist who was deported to Asvencim by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorance of Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over Villareal earlier this month will allow them to confidently exit Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented halfback Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season to a 2-2 draw with Villareal, however, he believes the Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a trump.
"It was a substantial match for us because Villareal is a strong opponent," the 31-year-old footballer reflects.
"We started the game thinking we could get something, and scored a point.
Maybe in the end we could have scored the ball, but overall nothing was a good result as well.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had the best half of the field.
Another significant night for European football will take place on Thursday.
Hopefully we'll be able to earn three points, but it'll be a difficult game, as they showed good results in the last game, but given the crowd of wicket-keepers on the stands, I'm sure we'll be able to beat them and show a good game.
The past year has been determined to be difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, cross last season's result and succeed."
Women lose sleep out of fear for their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had an accurate idea of what care they wanted for themselves, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, Nationwide's vice president of life insurance.
That's what you should start with.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you unless you make your wishes known in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical help, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve yourself in the discussion of a financial advisor. it can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover those costs, or you can self-insure your life — provided you have the money.
Solve cases with legal documents: anticipate court battles.
Get confidence in medical care to assign a trusted person to control your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can't talk.
In addition, consider issuing a financial management trust.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that you pay your bills if you are unavailable.
Don't forget the details: imagine your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about banned medications and the presence of allergies?
Record these details in writing to be ready.
"It's not just financial issues that play a role, but also the professionalism of doctors," Martin adds.
"What medications are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything."

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that collapsed on the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection of communications, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Regency, a district north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a distressing disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and a tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Dongala is a regency that stretches along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
Regency is an administrative unit with status below the province, with 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but mainly concentrated in Morawali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times in the past 100 years by a tsunami.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in Dongala from the tsunami, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
Indonesia is in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes swept the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that swept to the south coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred in Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands outside of Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake pummeled the regency of Podzi Jaya in Aceh province, causing havoc and panic as people were reminded of the devastation resulting from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes swept over the tourist island of Indonesia's Lambok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on family domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to a report by the KTUU channel, Palin is in the Matanuska-Susitna detention facility under a $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "exactly innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network reports.
Palin is accused of three Class A offenses, for which he is threatened with imprisonment for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with committing a Class B crime punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell them about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence, and possession of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Video clips showing the moment of impact have spread on social networks.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami swept ashore.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
The federal attorney's office in New York City is seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City, who has killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly took advantage of a rented Home Depot truck in October to drive on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, beating off pedestrians and cyclists in his way.
To justify the death sentence, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to court materials, there is a possible death penalty for both offences.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigating judge stunned Saipov with a 22-point indictment that included eight murder charges to support racketeering; this clause is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of trafficking.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "an early and deliberate planning", and describing the crimes committed by Saipov used phrases such as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Saifula Habibulaevich Saipov Caused Injuries, Damaged and Caused Losses to Diego's Families and Friends Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lori Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlio, Erna Ferrocucci, Erna Diego Menda Mendoza and".
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last criminal case was opened with a death penalty measure in the form of a death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York on a federal case was applied was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been punished after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A pair of Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an outlaw from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt pleasure from his act.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed authorities that he was inspired to attack by watching an Islamic State video on the phone.
He also asked for permission to fly the flag of the Islamic State in a hospital palace, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the indictment, which consists of 22 counts.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "definitely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Paton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory Member of Parliament says Nigel Farage should set up Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at a Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel uncomfortable" with Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs offered his candidacy to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would already "get out" if Mr Farage were to serve as Brexit secretary.
But the problem faced by Mrs May, trying to reconcile her disparate supporters, got even worse when the Tories, who are in favor of maintaining EU membership, mounted a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Premier is trying his best to keep the compromising Chequers Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and supporters of the exit as well as the EU itself.
The Allies persist in trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "disorder".
Speaker Bone said at a rally in Salihal, Leave Means Leave, that he wants to "throw the Checker off the board".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made equal and that he should set aside responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have already come out," he said.
Member of Parliament for Wellingboro added, "I'm for Brexit, but we need to move away from the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We haven't fought world wars to be addicted.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country."
Spadar Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue."
A supporter of Brexit and a member of the Torah, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in a conversation with reporters said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checker Plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out on the streets and electing us.
Please abandon the plan and start listening."
In a scathing address to Mrs May, she added, "Prime Ministers stay in office as they fulfill their promises."
Spadar Farage said politicians needed to be forced to "feel uncomfortable" if they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a matter of trust between us - the people and the politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'It won't get away with you.'"
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make those of our politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country who gave us victory in Brexit, and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit party passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists brandished Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adanis got upset with the Conservatives over the security problems they faced due to the party program when the conference opened.
"These are people who tell us they can have ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the balloting process for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will "pay close attention to the balloting process for the presidency."
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about her future during a general assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to go for re-election, she is opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Deal, who was the co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it was already the 36th meeting with voters in the general assembly format, which was held on Saturday afternoon in Halioka.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that to happen, a woman has to be in charge."
The arrest occurred after the death of basketball player Sims from the Louisiana State University team.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that a suspect in the murder of basketball player J.S. Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditan Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting asking for help identifying the person featured on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot on the morning of Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died," Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed, and shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A six-foot-tall, six-inch (201 cm) sportsman grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on the field from the start, averaged 17.4 minutes on the course, pitched 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the World Championship title after an intra-team deal won over Sebastian Fethel
From the moment Walter Botas was ahead at the Lewis Hamilton qualifying event on Saturday, it became clear that the guidelines within the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good spot on the jester and almost left Hamilton at will while he defended his spot on the first two vibes and invited Fethel to attack his friend on the team.
Fethel was the first to go on a pit stop and left Hamilton reeling at the end of the overall mass of the racers, which was exactly the maneuver that was to become crucial.
The Mercedes pilot went on a pit stop on the lap later and came out behind Fethel, but Hamilton came out ahead after several wheel-in-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside space free, risking to hold on after the double mana.
Max Verstappen in his 21st birthday started from the back row of the network and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led most of the race while holding the tyres because he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Raikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he left for a pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his speed on the remaining eight laps, so Rajkanen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri spoke fantastically all weekend and expressed himself to real gentlemen if I was allowed to speak that way.
"The team did an outstanding job to take first and second place," Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leak of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the indications given to Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "sleazy, disgusting and untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see angry, rabid, and lying people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document-- "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
There was nothing of me."
Wait a minute.
We allowed the escape... No, we didn't," he added, parading the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing the charges put forward by Ford against Kavanaugh and he escaped in early September - but Feinstein denied that the escape had occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her story leak," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked that the story remain confidential and I granted her request."
But her denial probably did not please the president, who so commented on it during Saturday's rally: "Here's what I'll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are full of determination to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the meanness, and they don't care who they hurt, through whom they have to step in order to gain power and control," the president's "Mediaite" message reads.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee
Dundee Stars played back for Friday's defeat by the Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League, winning the back-to-back 5-3 match in a home game on Saturday.
Thanks to a hit by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baville, the Giants led by two tackles at the start.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equalled the number before Dwyer regained the Jayants lead.
Francois Bouchard of Dundee equalled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen two goals secured the team a win.
It was the third Parasitic in the Elite League in a season for the Adam Keefe team to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer from Kendal McFol's pitch, and another four minutes later, Bavilier doubled the number after David Rutherford's pitch.
In the lively first period (13:10), Sullivan opened the number on the part of the masters of the field and then Kaun equalled the number after Matt Marquardt's transfer (15:16).
Dwyer secured the Giants the lead on the first break, killing his second goal for the meeting at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bouchard equalised again, killing the puck at the team's numerical advantage (27:37).
Kaun and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee into the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory along with the team's fifth number in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five meetings, will play the last match at the home ground against Milton Keynes on Friday.
The airspeeder dies, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An aviator in Indonesia died heroically after ensuring a successful take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news following a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday that caused a tsunami.
Strong underground tremors are still ongoing, and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were rescued by escapees, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in a dispatch tower that was wildly swinging at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained in place until the board of the 6321 Batik Air Company, which was at that point on the runway, broke off from the ground.
He then jumped out of the dispatch tower when he decided it was breaking down.
He later died in a hospital.
As reported by the Australian program ABC News, according to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan which was to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach several thousand, and the disaster risk reduction agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Button is limited.
Sutop agency spokesman Purva Nugroha reported, "Maybe the number of victims will increase even more, as many bodies still haven't been able to recover from the wreckage."
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a car 'quickly' brings bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
They're robbing shops everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don't know what awaits them here.
It's already a tragedy, but things can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jock Widoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the troops, "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports "CNN".
Earlier this year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lambock, killing more than 550 people.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports one man missing without news after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which was on a flight that made an emergency landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team had been safely evacuated from the plane that was melting and now claims to be missing without the news of one passenger.
The Air Niugini company said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon it could not give a report on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report details of the passenger; such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after landing the aircraft on the water in an attempt to land at the island's Chuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unexplained.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing strip.
According to reports from some witnesses, the plane missed the landing strip.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
"It's very successful," Janes reported.
According to him, he and others were able to wade through the belt in the water before the plane's emergency exits, which had already melted.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming as well as that he had sustained a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors ramming nearby the wharf also aided in the rescue by using a hoverboat to carry people ashore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of Papua New Guinea-registered aircraft over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst resumes the course of events on the night the woman was burned by a resident
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlet has given indications for several hours as an involved expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to a jury how he used records from mobile phones to recover the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Thelis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Rowlett, he received location information from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicts his past statements.
When it was revealed that his cell phone was next to Chambers's at the time when, according to him, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, police were on their way to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford gave indications on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that evening, he said that he was "lying, since my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Telis's claim that he had been acquainted with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Records from mobile phones showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Rowlett, sometime after Chambers died, Thelis removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Haley said.
The defense side should start arguing the sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive settings.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins: political statements and on-racial issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have returned to collectives such as The Fugees and Common, a popularity in the UK.
Another black one?!
Nanny from New York sues married couple for 'racist' message after dismissal
A New York City nanny sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a randomly sent message from her mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies they are racists, equating the pose to "extortion".
In 2016, Lynsie Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
"NEEEEE, YASHCHE ADNA CHARNASCURA," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent a message to Miss Morris twice.
As the New York Post reports, realizing the mistake, "felt awkward" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nanny, who was also African-American, was doing a bad job, and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris paid a day's work and sent home on Uber.
Morris now sues the couple and wants to be compensated for her dismissal according to the terms on which she was originally hired, though without a contract: $350 a day for six months with accommodation.
"I want to show them that this is not the way to do it," she told the Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied accusations of racism, saying that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, given that they could not trust her, after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," reported Post's husband, Joel Plasca.
"Would you trust your children with someone you've been rude to, even casually?
Your fiancée?
It's not?"
Plasca equates the pose to "extortion" and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
"And you will persecute a man in that position?
It's pretty tough," added an investment banking specialist.
Although litigation is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the married couple on social networks, subjecting them to harsh criticism of their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers feared that readers would not supercharge the bear speaking, said in a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it's published.
So thoroughly read this, already aware of the tremendous success of Paddington."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC operator before daring to write a book for children about the little toy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a fairly quiet man, and not at all boastful," she said.
"But since Padington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's pride for a child that got something done: you're proud of them, though it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Padington's success in that kind of key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave his due to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to break up with her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Beyond regularly phoned to tell me that things are really bad, that she won't stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I called Na to say she was going to die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave to be afraid of her heart were slowly leaving her body.
She died some time ago, and it was the very end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was unfolding there.
I couldn't stand or scream or cry because there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - and they did not know at all what she had to go through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and tears flowed down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's in flight that Ned's sense of compassion has gripped me.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who are embarrassed to put up cards to warn suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their dearest people who have committed suicide are doing everything to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting cards on with warm words and phone numbers that people can get help from, on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began his depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the way I do," she said.
45-year-old Mrs Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
People said his smile would brighten up any room."
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Spouse Davis says, "I'm constantly concerned that there might be unpleasant consequences to this."
Mistress Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet - you need to talk."
Mistress Hasfries, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he didn't even look at them."
She said his death was a big injury for them, but had to live with it: "There was a huge hole in the family.
It just kills us.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

Future Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain because the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought we could have what he wants - a limited time and scope investigation - we can get a little bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that his concern was that the committee was "falling apart" due to actually getting caught in traffic.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is explained by time.
The midterm elections just five weeks later, on November 6 - when Republicans are expected to lash out, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect the candidate they need to the top court.
George Bush called a senator to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the issue of voting equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea declined under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors from North Korea to the South has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Pak Bo Sun, bringing South Korea's Ministry of Unification data, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
Spadar Pak said the main reasons are increased border control between North Korea and China and higher costs that have been set by smugglers for transshipment.
Pyeongyang has not commented on this in any way.
Most defectors from the north get South Korean citizenship as they go.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 residents of North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is more easy to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily guarded.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in a state of war - have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyeongyang for talks concerning denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards fully freeing the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Jan Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we are not going to disarm first," Mr. Ree said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh a "sterile", she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh a "sterile" and said he was not fit to work for the Supreme Court at his own pace.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune edition festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved that way, she would be called a 'steress,'" told Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally refuted the accusations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and could not speak when his family and the school's senior classes were being discussed.
He also explicitly accused Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a "grateful and orchestrated assassination of a person" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's speech showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had a bias against Democrats.
"I believe he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he's not telling the truth in Congress or in the FBI, then he not only shouldn't be working in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he's working now," Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in Rowe v. Wade because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect us to say 'how wonderful it is,'" Pelosi said.
And a woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified indictment speech, months and years of anger just overflowing, and she can't fake it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was working as a director somewhere, and who said that when she got angry, she cried, but she worked out the technique of behavior. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the co-conspirators, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And just kept talking.
I think it was great."
Tears are allowed in part as an exit sum because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, at which I once cried from indescribable anger, then I was grabbed by an elderly woman behind the collar - a restrained chief who always scared me a little - and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they proved you."
Patricia Shrodar, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt filed for marriage treason on a yacht called Monkey Business and walked out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder thought she herself might be half-way into the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision," laughingly she told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I was completely unnecessary to them.
Someone called this situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Since the campaign had already gone quite a long way, she lacked the funds, so she said she would not take part in the election unless she ran $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters who had sacrificed $1,000 to men had only given her $250.
"Do they think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she made the statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so strongly gripped by the emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to get money and aimed at voters rather than candidates, and anger at sexism - that she had caught the breath.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Shrodar's beautiful press reaction to her condition.
"You might think that my corporate sponsor is paper surveiller maker Kleenex.
I used to think, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
Why a trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between China and the United States have been deafening, and since the war is far from over, in the longer term misunderstandings between the countries may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's major export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week when new tariffs affected goods totaling $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods that come into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in this way, raising tariffs recently from five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed the United States a symmetric response, and the economy's second-largest is unlikely to lead.
To force Washington to back down, we need to deepen in demand, but public leaning before the United States is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the long run could support China, reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic fallout is much more dangerous than observers had thought before," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, in a new research paper.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by the war, which has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said conditions in the country were improving.
"As of today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions to return refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Rydar Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rydar Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won a Rydar Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown back when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who competed most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water for 3 pairs on the 16th hole, giving up this match to Frances Malinari.
Italian golfer Malinari played perfectly in all rounds, becoming one of four players to pass this field 5-0-0 from the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating on the European team, Thornbjorne Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Polter of England, who may have played in his last Rydar Cup.
The veteran eight-cup Rydar Spaniard Sergio Garcia made the player who has won the tournament the most with a career-high score of 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said the excited Garcia after the European team won.
He passed the batting to his countryman John Ram, who played American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won at Tiger Woods, a man whose career I've followed since childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four caps in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Rydar Cup.
Amazing statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus on this score.
The American team competed with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finns, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning we have sometimes shown Europe what we are capable of.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'll be working with the Golf Association of America and our Rydar Cup committee, and we'll be moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been rerouted."
