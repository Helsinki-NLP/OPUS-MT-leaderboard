Republican strategy of resistance to re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of election fraud in the United States are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That’s why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 making it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained a new dimension after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to produce a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will and take away the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law passed in Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills obliging voters to produce photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state’s government agency.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Student voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for voting.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
This is the first time such a requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of immigrants from Latin America.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to put some 10 million citizens on the lists.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
During the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike whites, who make up 76% of voters, only 46% of voters were early voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo IDs.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as an obvious focus on influencing the 2012 election results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: test or not?
In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, false-negative and sometimes false-positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men who are so reluctant to undergo medical examination, there is something to doubt even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those patients who were screened and those who were not.
This study also showed, after a 12-year follow-up, that the likelihood of metastases is 30-40% higher in those who have not been screened.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test starting at age 50, or 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a threat to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are accurately determining the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
I would recommend taking the test.
But it’s also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movembert has created a tool that allows you to evaluate all the pros and cons of passing the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people ate healthy and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that number would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to people’s health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the association adds.
Meals
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies are not unambiguous.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies are yielding conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
There is also a lack of clarity in assessing the effect on the development of vitamin D cancer.
However, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that it is important to discuss your anxiety and family history with your doctor.
"Testing doesn't lead to cancer".
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, a report that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a real stir - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, nothing more or less.
In addition, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the Standard Model — our best, or at least “least imperfect,” description of the nature and behavior of matter — but which has never been discovered before.
But physicists are not yet sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet enough for full confidence.
Imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and we’ll see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment in time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
On the other hand, there are bosons, a nefarious gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can calmly find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite extraordinary) Particle Adventure Berkeley Lab, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the “particles of force”, through which the main forces of nature and which in some way belongs to the Higgs boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “particle of light”, which is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "violation" is born electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons of "power carriers".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you need to achieve very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the one operated at CERN — the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! — is needed to achieve such huge energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is also useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never be kept on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "could" all this research bring, Ms. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to feel the discrepancy between the results of observations and the forecasts of SM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be revealed, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to “new physics” and shut some Model holes.
The latter, I must say, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (ow!), or for dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the universe (ow!).
But so far, such discrepancies have not been found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
Look: in the early 60s, pioneers of laser research in Bell laboratories could not even imagine what revolution their work would cause.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous was pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered more like a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for the tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Quebec Commission for Decent Death recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, and a bill is being drafted at this time.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
"Duty" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregi.
The cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year reprieve.
“I was given five years, I lived seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadboua palliative care shelter in Beloy, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at the table, on which there is an appetizing lunch, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicines, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before an ordinary death.
“My biggest wish to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
“During our lifetime, we are taught that a man should urinate standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois shelter.
Regressing to the state of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on the ability of a person” to come to terms with the decline, he says.
Since, according to many people involved in palliative care, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative home are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more care, called "therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying “consciously of suffocation.”
But the illness allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says, before allowing her to put on a breathing mask.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
That's not enough, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
Here, life goes on in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it’s physical, emotional or emotional comfort.
To the dying person, we will agree to provide mouthwashes from brandy or pepsi, whatever he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son finished this beer in the legs of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of nursing.
In the shelter of Victor Gadbua, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and has tried everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor Gadboua Asylum come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in an orphanage.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbois Asylum and the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this large gap in Quebec’s health care system that makes many palliative care physicians wary of passing a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by the luminaries in palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they are not receiving adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Helen Richard's survival were already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death are grateful to the medical staff for not fulfilling their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to feel better.”
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about the colossal “system” that envelops the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
An industry that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system collapses after all the means have been put into action, jokes Jacques Duchenault, MP and former chief of police of Montreal."
It was thanks to him that the scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charet, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchenne Report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties, and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” if some held back their instincts to take a stake.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already removed two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "open up the schemes behind the individuals."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011, which included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer", which after 2009 forced the "sink cartel" of Montreal, to stop overstating the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next in line is Gilles Wayancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, several Montreal route engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the “system” of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a certain intermediary associated with the mafia, who, in turn, transferred the money of the party of Mayor Gerald Tramble “United Montreal”.
In the 2000s, Zambito made money to the right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mainly liberals who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the cost was inflated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: for ten years, he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totaling $ 736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the cost of which he overstated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they received on the paw, inflating bills by 30-40% with fake additions.
Then one organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash desks with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the Riviera de Prairie district in the east of the island, she has been resisting since 2010 the sale of a municipal site bought for $ 5 million and resold for $ 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she “will pull a thread that allows you to understand the functioning of the system infested with ants to stop gangrene and identify those responsible.”
This process is characterized as “painful, but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchenault, for his part, notes that “officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about this scheme,” but did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $ 100, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of granting government contracts and financing parties: “We can not go lower; boldly understanding the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenault calls on those who laugh to look into their own courtyard ...
"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have achieved an extraordinary scale in PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors cause me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From the very beginning at the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfontaine to my arrival in St. Etienne, I have always taken a step forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer it is not new to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be at the level and give his best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is helped by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti in charge?
Absolutely.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical personnel.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-profile clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I got away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified for one-eighth finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take the return match in one eighth final.
Can PSG become a top-notch European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for it.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position for the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project real.
Not to take the title in the First League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship.
We were close to that last season.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Even though strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we’re at home winning 4-0 against Troy and we’re still found to be critical, of course, it’s a little upsetting.
We wonder what people expect of us first.
We can never win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed with time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who have failed to make it to one-eighth of the finals for two seasons, even though they’ve spent a lot of money too!
Given the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not on top last season, were “awakened” by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we won.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
Well, what if they say that there is some kind of "Gold dependence".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is a First League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to be a part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play good matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first months in charge of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a tough coach, he is close with the players and inspires to win.
How was Laurent Blanc?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
“Blanc has achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A good deserved draw (1-1), snatched on October 16 in Spain - is this the fundamental match?
This game gave me faith in myself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, in my career there were no such matches.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, there is clearly a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later before returning to around $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as “credits” are used to promote in a video game that are earned in the process of playing or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are simultaneously bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers, and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, similar to an email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through solving a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
We are talking about the phase of hashing a file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before “hashing” it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
Network life has already experienced ups and downs.
Bitcoin service providers have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noiza, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payments company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoin to gold.
Pierre Noiza, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which thus comes out cheaper.
The owner has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough just to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, Pierre Noiza clarifies, assuring that he has already thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“It will be some time before Bitcoin is approved, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are considered to be increased today, if this system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not relying only on us.
We were mainly affected by the Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer exist as soon as the West begins to behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our days.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into dealers seizing state lands to resell them for development to repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracts.
They are discredited; by the way, most of them did not even fight.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have managed to American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world at the time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return either to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that are watched everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who waged an anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore provincial squads that would not be subordinate to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s, and even earlier.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dams are functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were there only to take possession of them.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without the means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “win hearts and minds” and fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service of “military-civilian activity” under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of the local workforce, were able to help contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and increased arable land.
What do we keep in mind when we spend two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale farming from local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which farmers, they told me, want, you need to give them a little non-military support, which would be well controlled and would come to them directly.
Difficult Births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohamed Morsi’s new risky move.
While Egypt is divided more than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, he has decided to play va-bank.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Soon, two years later, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "violate the word" and "violate the right."
In the camp, his followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article after article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I reserve extraordinary powers”, which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to deliver their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To achieve the required quorum, 11 alternate participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around ... a time for prayer, since some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were wrongly tuned.
The text on which yesterday there was still a vote consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 eventually remained identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of Shariah are the main source of law”.
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is a basic requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules” that would enable them to be enforced more rigorously.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” answered the liberals, who see only PR in this.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, because “people called to make decisions are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.”
We can see the beginning of the theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, are excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with a university education, some have studied in the French system,” says Alexis Bloye, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to “fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, there may be a question as to how competent the civilian judges are to rule on this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have significantly decreased compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will be held not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy has been maintained and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speaks about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy places, the navel of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the pristine nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this “bottle” receive God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the holy things in Jerusalem.
Believers here go the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Antonia-Pretorium fortress - where the court was, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Calvary - to the site of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the Wailing Wall, left over from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
By tradition, people of different confessions leave here notes with desires, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from the secret shelter from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them with their own course.
The rest on this historic peak is delivered by a lift along the cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus carries him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t go to all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exposition widely presents paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-ban of Al Basha, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you are in total darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Cheer up
Israel's three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there are swimming all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is brine, easily keeping afloat even if they do not know how to swim at all.
The landscapes around are incredibly beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with salt water - rape, and healing mud, and treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to put in order the shattered nerves.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "own" sign, Fortune will become favorable.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the Crusader fortress.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
Carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on note
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
Money for the trip is better to take not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $ 1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower Town with the Upper.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
It offers a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - phallalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fattened cats that gagly "walk on their own".
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Ants love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $ 15 per day.
A bicycle rental will cost 15 shekels per day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Language of Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of all to travel and rest came citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
“The great and powerful” to Moscow will bring: migrants save money on language
While deputies and human rights activists argue what the law on mandatory language testing will give, scammers have already appeared in the country selling “lip” certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
For the most part, these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind in their homeland.
On December 1, the law came into force, according to which every labor migrant will be required to take an exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, household and retail trade.
However, over time, - promise in the FMS, - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, you will have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history, and the basics of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Not subject to the law and people who managed to get certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples’ Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press the question: what will it actually give?
What will change the mandatory knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, this will reduce the number of people suffering from “labor slavery”.
A lot of people are now talking about the protection of the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will put him in a terrible cramped barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“At home, they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are deceived, passports are taken away, the promised salary is not paid,” confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan.
Don't swear, asshole!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, admit that they not only do not know the language of the country in which they seek, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as a misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a good primary education.
After all, their families do not even have anything to feed their children, not to mention decently dress them, dress them and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys are sent to work at the earliest opportunity.
It is difficult, if bad with knowledge of the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, human rights defenders note one important point.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No Foreign Entry"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be done quickly and for only a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov told reporters.
"Float, don't skimp, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents were fake.
Several "lip" certificates for passing language tests have already been withdrawn by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they went to the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: it will cost a migrant laborer three thousand.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “shells” can not just be bought, both government officials and human rights activists agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The percentage of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to toughen the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Pressing shots at weddings, when there were no victims, and the massacre staged by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age from which you can get a license for weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced in the state Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “tightening the screws”.
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public rifle organizations - demand to abandon "meaningless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a criminal lawyer, told the BBC Russian Service.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for six months of 2012 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while during the same period 1,168,000 crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter believe that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not put the criminal to go to the black market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims that it controls the situation with the distribution of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market of weapons is replenished through several channels.
The main such channels are five, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is the “army or military trail”, that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were carried by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets said.
The next type of “black weapon” is stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes those taken from police warehouses, and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal “barrels” go on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occurred in many military warehouses.
“There are proven versions that some of the arsons were made specifically to cover the shortage,” says the former military.
According to Barants, arms manufacturers are making their contribution.
“Now there are private weapons factories that can not stand the competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its own production, sometimes handicraft, and the mafia formed, which organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts considered what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open portal data on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there “due to officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14% of cases are thefts at the stage of weapons production, 5% are “black archaeology”.
The sales consultant at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapons found by black diggers have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most often, he says, for a new batch of sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through an ensign, a person buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
He's being discharged, passed through a fence.
“He takes her to the city and here he sells 900 euros apiece with two stores,” he says.
“However, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when the plan for solving crimes burns, they conduct a control purchase from dealers in illegal weapons,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya", where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner", where we will bargain.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Viktor Baranets
To get the gun, I need an acquaintance who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I am not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a few knuckles through a man I'm sure of.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won’t give it up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos where there was "anything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Barants, is not offered a cat in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there we set a target.
“I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon hits well, we start to bargain,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet lead to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents and personal meetings.
“It is enough to have a certain amount of money,” write in the advertising cap on the website “Buy a combat pistol or machine gun.”
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Should minors be sold?
“Without a license of course,” asks the user “Ivan” (the spelling is saved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - succinctly formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of front-end sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons are rowing with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish for bait, and then produce coal in Siberia

I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through the ATM makes a payment.
“In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapon is hidden,” says Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Arms.
Viktor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can remain without weapons and get behind bars.

Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can meet the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Arms organization, Makarov’s pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
It will take a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these middle-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, workers strike fast food and supermarkets
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the McDonald’s box office
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
While no one dares to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
Actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that ordinary Walmart workers and fast food systems receive, the goal of the organizers of the protests is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday”, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, which captured millions of ordinary people and sometimes was accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed, along with trade unions and left-wing activists, the corporation’s stores, whose goods are designed for people of modest and average income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees are only at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheap goods in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or manual scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded a pay raise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 an hour can’t afford it, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $ 3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on wages now.
If Walmart completely shifts the growth of wages on the shoulders of buyers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They will spend $12.39 more per year than they do now.
Supporters of Walmart rather note that the protests occurred in only nine states and did not cause the corporation any damage.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporation spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that fewer than five Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just “another PR stunt” by the union organizing it.
"Free cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart stores (they are not welcome in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn’t even give you sick leave or pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
The minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants grow over time, but not much, and on average, their ordinary employees receive $ 8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York with such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once through “McDonald’s” passed almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their shelves after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I’m constantly confronted with interviews with employees of McDonald’s, who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this and punishing trade union activists with pickpocketing and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But to embrace the union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Disagreements
Loud protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The action culminated in a mid-afternoon rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which featured several local Democratic politicians, notably City Council member Jumaine Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn't even give you sick leave or pay you for honest work!"
Prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio, supported the demonstrators, saying that “we must stand united in support of fast food workers to achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest such action in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it involved only a few hundred people, and not all of them were employees of fast food, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will produce a mass movement flame.
"While cheating the brain turns out to be average"
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the theme of augmented reality has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown to Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft’s Cambridge laboratory, Sharam Izadi, it follows that for scientists of this company, glasses are a passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Can you please tell us more about what your research team is doing?
- We are engaged in the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking at them with a finger.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and anticipate dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else lies ahead?
Even though Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good yet.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, fuck these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because you do not always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over swinging, but over such stingy, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were removed not by the camera of the device, but by a wrist bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a mixed type of management, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You can say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can’t do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual encounter.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is something from which we can build in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels of 8 at a speed of 1000 fps.
But it’s not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betiches from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touches, so that the frames per second were larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second is a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, a normal sensor of visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in three-dimensional position determination.
Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it is not very convenient to walk around all the time, holding your smartphone in raised hands, but here’s what I think: the coolest option would be a “transitional” augmented reality, when based on a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and further everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of this idea: there is no tactile feedback!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a good press recorder!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" tangibility - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you were blown on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel the moment he sees something?
That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task that has to be fought for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking on an open, almost infinite - we are also working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher — many things in an absolutely rudimentary state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the townspeople who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the shocking artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, which is found either at the Russian Museum, or at the Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and vernissages.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile among citizens, lifting everyone’s mood.
Recently, he picked up a charm and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer, engaged in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray causes aggression and excitement of an unkind nature.
But my provocations are aimed at starting the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonevshchina, which led to the "Pushkinskaya-10", and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, every genre except the word.
- And all this united in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: BUT, Tekila-jazz, I remember how the Cord was brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
Cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in a tight tight, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Cali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went his great career, and the basic education and upbringing he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the club "Griboedov - it's echoes from the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regulars are gone.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was "People of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, my climax ended.
In modern times, according to the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be that - it's painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dress-up in an orderly manner.
Now they meet on clothes, focusing on external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't give a hand and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you in the role of an urban charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, they will be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people strayed into packs, bohemian one loved, simpletons another.
Now everyone is broken up into micro-community, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you like.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes for a few thousand!
- He's getting dumped, and the sex-social sphere is working.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything is drying up.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what they have gained.
I painted such paintings in my youth that one collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting.
I am in favor of such a culture.
- Kirill, what is lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing as an official from culture.
However, not all of them can be cultured.
Under the right kings, it was not so, the kings, perhaps, did not understand very much in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed, because we need higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who should look for other museums.
What is Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil there.
And on our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural ground, and we have more writers now than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer is thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the help of a grant from St. Petersburg
Giving Birth in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a replacement planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises: how to continue their lineage in zero gravity or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Surdin, senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS).
But if on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
To approach the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the breeding of insects in orbit, tiny fruit flies-drosophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops in zero gravity conditions.
We're getting a perfectly normal chick.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Unable to find support, the chicks randomly threw up.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
“And twice we hatched chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” Vladimir Sychev notes the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
With animals, the last time a biological "minicoche" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with a fetus.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"This was just on biosatellites, but again - this is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, humans can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is a female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it will remain after a flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
“After all, no one answered this question,” says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice in orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We have a small number of cosmonauts, who after long flights everything went well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," concludes cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratorium CPC is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts practice their skills in open space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit a comfortable, but still alien environment, then for infants - a native element.
Little ichthyanders seem to confirm - life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months at the mother in fertilizing fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, only 2 weeks pass.
“It’s very little to forget something,” says coach Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for the child born, then gravity, gravity, is necessary for a woman.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus decreases.
All right, let's lower that, relying on birth stimulants.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go to childbirth, she will push him out.
"And then what?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely maladapted person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the IMBP RAS.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, over time, this will be a reality when Earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will become home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Control and Audit Department: Check of the schwartz system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktu?ln?.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack,” Kala commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nechas’ approach to the so-called Schwarz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be in some way established, and if it prohibits anything, then the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions that are charged with the obligation to verify and enforce obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
We are talking about a parallel test, which we started, probably, two years ago.
Simply put, the point is that European legislation affirms how public procurement should proceed, followed by national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished inspection, interesting differences were found - in other words, the legislation we have can be "accurate and error-free", but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop clarifying laws, reducing and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not a fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps this system will overflow with "papers" so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not decreased.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our KRU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, our CRU is Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized according to our principle, there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, that is, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it is impossible to say for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they are better at control?
Definitely not, but I don’t like that comparison.
But I must say that even model countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t get any benefit from working with our office, right?
Regarding domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affect your institution?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we began to use our new tool "detecting the risk of uneconomical", through which we drove almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law will bring benefits or additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "hardened" and they will be impossible to comply with.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are tied to the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
Then how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called Schwarz system. What does this mean?
Is the "Schwartz system" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies that are required to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say, “We will change this law and allow it,” but you can’t say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains rather strict rules on how and what should be formally conducted, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in some places, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snow-covered.
They are mostly passable, but in some places with greater caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should warm up a little.
Snow in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands there is a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are currently passable without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain trails, are passable.
But in some of their areas still lie the remains of frozen and sometimes infested snow.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located on the highlands.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradetsky region
The Department of roads and highways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on highlands, there may be a patch of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about the ice, which can form especially on the hills of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be near Lanskrona, Usti nad Orlitzi, Polichki, Svitavi or Vysokoe Mito especially on second and third class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located at Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoshe and Orlitsk mountains.
A patch of snow is located on the roads located on the highlands in the areas of Rikhnova nad Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today, there is variable cloudiness without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region this morning are passable, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is freezing, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In some places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost unlimited, however, road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzni and Takhov may come across frozen areas.
Second and third class roads are wet and there is also a slippery warning.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the sparsely used roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highlands of the Olomouc region should take into account snow porridge on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videlskiy Krshizh.
At night, snow forced road workers to go out, according to information from the road administration, about three centimeters of snow fell in Sumperk.
In other areas, the edges of the road are generally passable without restrictions.
“On the hills of Sumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading in the direction of Yesenik should keep in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle, ”the dispatcher of the Sumperk road control told CHAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenik went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the highlands after treatment with chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberk, drivers should be careful in forest areas where humidity still persists.
Ustetsky Krai, Liberetsky Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few hard-to-reach places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road is closed on the site from Telnitsa on Klinitsa in the Ustetskoe region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - it rained and snowed all day, at night the sky cleared and frosts began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highways and on the I/13 highway on the border of the Ustetskoy and Liberetsky Krai.
Because of the branches of the trees curved under the snow layer, touching the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnitsa on the Kninitsa.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans get so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we joke about it all the time and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell me more about this to the readers?
We are talking about a national fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar has, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time provide us with support.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world is canceled."
Will the already beloved YouTube audience anthem sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be played live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video by Tomasz Ganak, also participating in the performance of Xindl X.
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people of the Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
Where will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlichki Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Yedlichka Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and in this way we try to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the additional construction project of the Edlichki Institute, a separate building will appear in the future, in which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grand events" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we’d love to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we’re in the United States, would love to do a performance in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It’s not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their strollers have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and tool boxes.
However, so far we have managed this without any problems. Czech Airlines and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east it is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and here is still a curiosity about the independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there are such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities move independently on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere else.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-free is one thing, but the moment famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is now very popular, but back to two years ago, what made you start it in 1998?
I went to the Edlichki Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician and play including the saxophone, then together with a colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has it only gotten popular in recent years, or am I confused about something?
It’s true, it helped us that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, in fact, as if does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that imitate each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, it is natural.
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Have you been successful because you are the tough boss that many people think you are?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Ladja Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
The goal of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlichki Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK, for children under 12 years of age admission is free. Tickets can be bought in advance in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency ministers, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of the agency's projects over the years.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights into space, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Astronautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltrie and André Louis Hirsch Award for "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known world advocate of astronautics, and his contribution was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland, a railway ladder was built, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was used to accelerate or to brake the trolley.
Information about this ladder is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The research was carried out by the Armament Engineering Section in collaboration with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzytski.
From the surviving materials, it can be seen that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket, proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in a specialized press, and the following year the work “Air Torpedo Rocket and Aviation Bomb Rocket” by the author of Lelyva-Kzhivoblotsky appeared.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects of military use of missile equipment was handled by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society for Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about society mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problems", which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will be engaged in astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn of POA became its full member.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankevich, the first chairman of the International Astronautical Federation (1902-1959), became deputy chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM weather rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of covering a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested at the Bledovsky wasteland.
This missile was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first missiles of the RM type was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C) were developed, which varied in camera size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space volume of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then, versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The ruling sparked a lively debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economies in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), price stress arises.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state when the manufacturer, through the delivery of a cheap product, tries to withstand economic competition by “shipping down” the value of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market and, thus, increase his own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for unemployment, the inevitable expenditure of the state on social needs increases.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create a situation at the level of the economies of individual states when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are handing over their own populations to private capital despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to force their people economically to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for reducing the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years, there has been a public distribution of products to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra to get a living wage.
Such a scandal became known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced to either emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on a poverty-stricken salary in the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will someday come to the country.
But I wonder where he will come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, since the Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turks, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African is still working for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are sickeningly claiming that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere in the economy.
Next, we should answer the question whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the whole state, does not act for its own selfish purposes?
The definite answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that government ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type states, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly in such a situation, as described by Appian in the work “The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey”: “The state has long been falling apart, and departments are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal obtaining of favors with the help of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any bans, and people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice"... decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, in the end, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months."... "Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person."
As in ancient times, in modern society, their own reckless interests prevail without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The current result is no different from the past: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
Hence, the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes, we must look for in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't exist." - Guthelle Schnaper, wife of Meyer Amschel Rothschild
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, elicited many responses.
Some support Israel for its position that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians for its racism, its genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel for its role as a terrorist State.
I do not want to speculate about who is the perpetrator in these recurring waves of killings and who is the victim, after all, of today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (considering the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of it derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be admitted that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in a single generation.
Among astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be regarded as the head of an octopus (I do not know if someone is standing over them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don’t write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90s of the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name with criminal activities in the highest spheres in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, increasing wealth or both.
They have large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of their country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great 33rd-level Freemason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial rule, especially Great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds works is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was supposed to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations on Germany, which created the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only necessary to throw the Germans a strong enough, denouncing the guilty and offering simple solutions of the Leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played the function of the fifth column of the war, when fomenting.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was initially held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war by a third.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (to take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers give people to vote in elections only their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu the Hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, international banker-loyal politician doing everything to start a war with Iran that, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran’s control of the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of all world oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to destruction.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a creature under total control.
And he makes all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, have a mark on his right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked with the name of that beast, or the number of his name, cannot buy or sell.
Here is the wisdom: anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
Operation Argo: When the worst is nowhere to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later amplified by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck “Operation Argo” describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult turn, they finished their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story, according to which they went on Canadian passports as members of the crew who were looking for a place in the country for filming a sci-fi epic.
Combination of Genres
The plan, which was invented by the expert on the "evacuation" Tony Mendes, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be reliable, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, held press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-cinema", the story of a successful venture, a scam - an example can be a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck had a great career.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and his play ceased to be an object of ridicule.
“Operation Argo” is his third feature film, after the dark detective “Goodbye, baby, goodbye” (2007) and the thriller “City” (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not shot in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that raised the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck demonstrates this in Argo, where Tehran is “playing” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history changes suddenly somewhere.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes thinking something up - there it all comes out not so elegant (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the pursuit of the runway look rather far-fetched).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is absent-mindedness associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind you of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as to show how exaggerated the idea of omnipotent and omniscient special services.
Ballooning rules, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce a competition for the “most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop”.
“We were driven to this by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities that have already been nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013," Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for chickens, as a result of which eggs have risen in price this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "butter oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic light bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even defends the demands of its banks under threat).
The lobby’s interests are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union should reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show “abnormal curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by the fact that it only harmonises the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite resistance from some states, has softened standards for fruits and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to waste of products.
A candidate for the poll may also be last year’s EU regulation, according to which sold balloons must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age can not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to American studies, according to which balloons when playing are a potential cause of death of children by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are forbidden to blow in fair duffles.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: everyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but should instead say “BYURM” (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovna poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to a few of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food reserves that can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have a sea.
Let’s ask the European Union for compensation,” said then-Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palace (ChSDP) in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain harvest in the country, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had complete stocks that had to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for subsidies were offered to the villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemets (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to draw up an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre orders are an exception
While regulations in member states are easily criticized, the EU’s efforts to regulate as well as to more effectively operate and develop the EU, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states achieved when discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheeses", but the "Tuzemsky rum", whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our manufacturers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
Rum can be called only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzola", marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parma ham, have already been, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, Gorzhelitsky and Trshebonsky carp and Zhatetsky hops.
Also, the EU trademark can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Gorzhytsky straws.
People want me to protect the republic, but I’m an amateur, says Okamura.
Senator, how does a man come to run for president?
I’m not thinking about being a senator or a president myself.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how over the past 20 years the country has been plundering, how thieves are fussing here, people are being raised by taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I’m 40 years old and I’m an independent, not affiliated with any party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for Senator or President.
You got into the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I always said that I would join the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the elections to the Senate.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can realize my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, murmur in our bar or at the TV, but at the same time are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
To this are added the media, which denigrate a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You began the struggle for the presidential castle with theses on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and reverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only an entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for excursions to become a free enterprise, this was promoted.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this deters citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without party laying on the shelves, without looking at dogmas, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a rightist or a leftist?
From the Czech point of view, I think that people refer to me more as a leftist.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about someone being on the right, it’s about someone being on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it will be offered by the CHRM or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
You are trying to get closer to that.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are spoken about by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will have only slogans.
And with this in politics you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you come out to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material liability?
I have no other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to tell why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality who will voice abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of pressure from the public.
I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; if that doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything by myself, so I’ve bypassed a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported the investigative journalist Yana Lorenzova, who uncovered the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on the scale.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of each potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about property declarations, but how are your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and several million more on the account.
By the way, I had Aston Martin, because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own $60 million in property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program isn’t that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs will essentially be covered by the senator's salary.
But with this money, I would not live, for example, could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand monthly.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to go into business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut back on this activity?
It doesn’t depend on the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a scumbag who would keep the republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much do you, as an entrepreneur, get paid each month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
If I were president, my business would be over.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Law".
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verhaig, passing by on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenisse, a little-noted sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vinnie Maas of MVRDV, a Rotterdam-based architectural bureau, master of bold column charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical, buildings, approached the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury members puzzledly looked around and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas folded a pyramid in size from his original gift and ended the speech in defense of his project with the following words: “Dear citizens!”
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Speikenisse, the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, has grown.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the contest “Best Library of the Netherlands 2012”.
Also, the project participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of a dairy plant, became richer in one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly - in Speikenissa appeared the first public building of cultural purpose in the history of this town.
The long road to the book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cap for cheese.
There is only one elevator passing in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed from all sides, the room is bright and easily visible, floors made of burnt brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create a feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
The look is involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Typically, bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of space on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Particularly pleased with the black bookshelves, which serve as either wall decoration, parapets, or stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guessing what this unknown material is.
“We wanted to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a lining under the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Those who overcome the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trowborst.
The heat of the earth is used for its heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Wide glued wood farms, arranged perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here, too.
As well as the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bookenberg “the soul of Speikenisse, which has long been lacking.”
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own collection.
These books were supposed to take up empty space on the shelves of the not yet fully staffed library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are stacked up.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Viny Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident is somehow connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Speikenisse wrote his literary history.
Let them be young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building an identity.
Szabo: “Germans should play a bigger role”
Germany abstained in the vote to recognize Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why not?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in a vote to impose a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was ruled by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent common policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only groping for their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which is carried out by France or Great Britain.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are very different from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relationship with the United States by abstaining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even in the United States.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has been clear in its support for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as an essential partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now this is not the case.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are instead forced to act on their own view of the situation.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This subject has always been sensitive.
But I think it’s clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take on the leading role?
Or is Germany still in the lead?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans don’t just deal with it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or increases dislike for you - this is life!

Trademark protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a claim.
But even then, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a company specializing in trademark infringement in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Imitators only need to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci you get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, for example, the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively fakes.
However, the cases of Pattloch are not like that. On behalf of his clients, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises officially receive from the trademark registration office the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it Ban Minpai, the passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
This is the name of women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not admit guilt.
“It hurts the business, it needs to be fought,” Pattloch said.
"The trademark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers greatly."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the trademark registry, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, because after a long time, the contested name became “the reality of the market”.
If the plaintiff is not lucky, then he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he caused damage to his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machines Sany, an enterprise that had recently acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes.
Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not to blame.
The trademark office of CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to the lack of personnel and equipment of the premises there.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the workflow to the norm.”
Thus, the number of pending cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting this is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth protesting it many times more, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission of its own, as surnames are not protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark registration office of CTMO rejected the claim of the Munichers.
True, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to fight until now.
You need to be alert
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs are hardly amenable to accounting, the archive of the company had to review even the acts of a hundred years ago to bring the evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side “a large six-figure sum in euros” for the settlement.
“It’s clear from here how expensive it is for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
“We have to be vigilant,” says Wenzler.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection regulations, rather foreigners should “anything that is worth protecting in any way should be registered also in China,” Wenzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing side licensing fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: to drown, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice at this.
The history of relationships that have covered a distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First comes the drowning: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up the bar on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that, the voices of the singers slowly grow - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, fascinate and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, nearly pops out of his cloth shoes as he guides them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty choir members from 23 to 69 years old came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om"Obani" is not an easy thing, each choir voice has its own text, besides in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa has found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or praiser.
They don't speak Bantu fluently in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: in southern Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected 40%
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, with many children among the residents.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus.
In Esitjeni in miniature reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted in the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before Imbogni saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothes, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since taken almost professional care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pubic pediculosis and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute believes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Chlamydial infections are significantly more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Human papillomavirus is also common among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are registered.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers can occur in the genital area, complaints when urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not give one hundred percent protection.
After all, part of the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent changes in sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, you can cure most STIs and avoid long-term consequences.
Chefdom, donations and, last but not least, fees for choir performances throughout Germany allow you to collect something.
“We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annete Lennartz, the association’s chairman.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Two Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well-equipped, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, is the support of the village.
Some of them have adopted up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in uniform appear in class on time every day.
Those who have no relatives go to the shelter to Haniisila, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized an HIV test for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to remain deeply silent.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it is related to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in past years.
But it also lies with the vagrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support cultural exchange a little, the Ibmogni Choir takes a tour of southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since the days of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, happened to cause tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the small village is difficult to find on the map, in the valley of the river Etsulveni it is more than known.
“Go to Esitzheni, there is light,” the people here say.
And after a 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
Next Post:NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered in ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life ended up elsewhere in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, “Phoenix”, explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to a new definition of the international astronomical Union from 2006, is not a “planet”.
This fragment of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink “newborn” stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation - scientists call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This iridescent heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-like ring is made up of material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, the colors get better.
As the red eye winks to the observer, the snail nebula in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity with the Earth's continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they originated is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it is the fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color rendering, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the image shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifidus comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part), as dark dust bands divide the hot heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and inevitably collide.
This star birth was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical cuts can call it the Southern Chain Wheel.
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
A large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
Star Cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars — 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the Universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces available to their eyes are becoming deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
Lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-harvesting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a "Very large telescope" - fully consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
The ESO Observatory in Chile is also planning to install the European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should stretch for as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, looks into the sky also with the help of Subaru telescopes and IRTTF.
In addition, Mauna Kea should have a new giant telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
You can look at the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets beyond the solar system — primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the goals of the telescope is to search the light of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the Messenger orbits closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch in 2004 of the probe "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists are now confident of this.

In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach the biblical age.
There is also a museum of longevity.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus rolls with thunder along a winding road past the hills overgrown with dense forests, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright that you can think that you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak well in Farsi and Azerbaijan and are distinguished by longevity.
The end point is Lerick.
A small town boasting too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to get to 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here in the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has something to interest tourists.
“In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Festival, and next year we will have a festival of the world’s oldest people,” Fatulaeva said.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biography of about eight dozen Talysh from these places, which are more than 100 years old, is documented here. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Muslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Muslumov seems extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years, he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the shepherd Muslyumov add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
“A striking number of elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “Sardinia is also home to an extremely large number of very old people.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of melted oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lerik area are strikingly often of biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years old living here.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
Talysh love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoeva lives in Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here, eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had grandchildren of their own.
There are also two children nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea in typical armoud puzzling glasses.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under her head scarf she hides long dark-skinned braids, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what she grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought food in my entire life.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it got better when Heydar Aliyev’s “favorite father” took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, knows practically no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount on which you can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzaeva’s long-grown son is also right: “Old people in our culture are deeply respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, surrounded by care and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not in the constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo signal a deep split in the country.
The future constitution, based on Shariah, was met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is not entirely clear to Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles managed to pull through in a nightly 15-hour obstacle course at an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that legal proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what do you mean by "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use vague language and the resulting legal luft to more strictly interpret Shariah.
At least, one new article hints at this: in all Sharia cases, Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamist institution, should be involved in the council, which enjoys great authority throughout Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversee legislation that would de facto have the effect of restricting the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is subject to interpretation
Another problem is that civilians must remain subject to military jurisdiction.
These courts during Mubarak's reign served to suppress the opposition.
Since the dictator’s ouster, up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military custody.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morality and values.”
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
But another forbids insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable to say that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Morsi proposes for signature and which, according to him, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the international atomic energy agency Mohammed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is “in the dustbin of history.”
Through Twitter, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to lead a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged,” Khaled Ali, an opposition politician, was quoted as saying by Egyptian media.
Many judges also said that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under veils and Salafi adherents who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi, "Clean up the country!" and assured him, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, on which everything began, provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clear.
Now it is time for the people to decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most are for the Islamists' project, this is considered a solved case.
“The concept of ‘human rights’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeed is furious with this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Morsi's influence over all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto annulled it," Saeda said.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There could be a payoff for that.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: “You are creating a monster that you cannot control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the most bad-smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s population of five million has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get the smell of rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I’m in a small town called Fagernes, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around the picturesque views covered with snow. It is very beautiful, but in the air there is an indestructible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of soul you need to achieve.
As the twilight thickens and gets colder, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, let’s say, exciting dish.
“It’s eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, local cumin vodka,” explains Haward Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time “Racfi general” who directs the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it with considerable portions of alcohol.
“Someone likes aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - not much different from the portion of sushi that you took with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish was soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the autumn.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and, muffling the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States is still remembered by the last generation.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a longtime rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) come here to work en masse.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat ominous element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most residents of the country seem to be satisfied with this.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called “the July 22nd”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of Norway’s current prosperity is the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re thriving,” says Anna, our waitress carrying trays of aged rakfiska, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don't like to show off, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone piled up money they didn’t have, Norway kept a thrifty count of all costs.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - I've had enough of rakfiska.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
A special Rakfisk dinner is held in my hotel, during which visitors vote on the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV air, in which the presenter is shown in a bow tie, surrounded by plates with a rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what's your estimate for the best fish out there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, perhaps overtaking the aquavit.
Maybe just by smelling the fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start to his career.
As Mexico’s newly elected president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable state.
This city is overloaded with transport and at the best time, and since Monday steel barriers have been erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico’s new head of state, Enrique Pena Nieto, will wear a presidential garb and take the reins of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now resigning, but the country is mired in a war on drugs, which in six years has already claimed about 60,000 lives.
“My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence,” Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the oval office of the White House earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, the political career of Mr. Pena Nieto developed alongside the President of the United States as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with potholes and pits that were previously on the site.
Signs with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We have hopes for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pena Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the accusations of lack of content that the opposition has put forward to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision for the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to quell drug gangs in those areas; violence against women is particularly acute.
On the wasteland near the vast landfill only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of murdered women were found.
More than a thousand women were killed in the State of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Pena Nieto, a figure far higher than that of the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pena Nieto ' s opponents, he was at best a victim of the murder of women during his term as governor.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most homes in this dilapidated area, Irineya Buendia struggles to hold back tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her boyfriend.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” Ms. Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already hamstrung.
Mariana’s mother recounts this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, which bears only one word: justice.
This, they say, is what has been denied to this family.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But it’s wrong, it can’t be, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,” she says.
Having put on the presidential garb on Saturday, President Pena Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility along with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new president has promised to make addressing this issue a priority during his presidency.
“I hope that he will be exactly the same president as the governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution claims.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning’s claims about poor detention conditions.
The hearing focused on Manning's time in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were cruel.
A U.S. Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified materials in US history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which, according to him, he had to endure while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, as part of the defence's motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves a sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning stated that while in custody he had intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, Attorney Fein, along with Manning, reviewed reports that were filled out after Manning's visits by administration officials during his time in Quantico prison, where he was held under strict detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Attorney Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed verbal concerns about the issues and that the administration officials who visited him had discussed the issues with him and said they would deal with them, but had not recorded them in writing.
“They were recording ‘no problem’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t bring it up in conversation,” Manning says.
A military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a panel meeting examining suicidal intent, which he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to get the "injury prevention" regime lifted and the conditions of imprisonment eased.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited regime of imprisonment - at a level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay with them canceling injury prevention... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is solved, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day — all alone.
Manning says he was only allowed to leave a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying in the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during sleep in his eyes constantly beat light penetrating the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, he said, he was woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at a morning checkup.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Asked by the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a rubber band of underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his imprisonment, and significantly reduce the term of imprisonment, if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin consideration of his case early next year.
The defense said it planned to ask Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with the most stringent regime.
Manning's charges include aiding and abetting the enemy, illegally facilitating the release of data on the Internet, passing information relating to national defense, and stealing state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My Crisis of National Self-Determination is a Mexican American Story.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico for lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked through the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called a Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I settled on the complex design of “American of Mexican origin.”
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got my U.S. passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pegna Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda included the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pena Nieto was eager to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans will now be able to stay in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any US statesman to speak at least a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, complaints are immediately heard in the press and among the elite of Mexican society that Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
The most difficult is Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about grievances?
There's enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone - a father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark-skinned, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
They see it differently in Mexico.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got good jobs, but we will not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people, like fake Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties to Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now be behind the silk curtain, finding in the United States a satisfying life, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my Mexican-American acquaintances do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations are not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexico’s ambassadors and represent Mexico’s interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many grievances in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And it's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still offended by the way their relatives were treated recently in Mexico.
Yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles of the New Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Can there be lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to a conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
There has been a habitual, pointless debate about who started it; many buildings have been turned into rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and for the first time since the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly stuck in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have swirled in a rebellious storm of many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not managed to stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give grounds for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, is implemented, the clashes this week only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses suffered by them.
Although some of the group’s leaders have been killed and 1.7 million people have been trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
With the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
A resurgent regional leader, Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim nations, has come out in support of Hamas; it was followed by Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and fastest-growing states.
Solemn supporters of Hamas claim the creation of an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the Hezbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, in which increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where the power of the king is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where under President Mohamed Morsi, the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood has strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator with little focus on supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic settings, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has justified the cost of building it and has successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
On the diplomatic front, the United States has remained true to its position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall that enters the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections scheduled for January 22 - united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What's the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If all power in the West Bank were given to them, wouldn’t they start firing rockets into Israel, as their counterparts in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and harshly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
It is possible that supporters of the “hard” line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt’s president, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change.
Israel must also take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As the democratic transition in the Arab world progresses, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, it is necessary to pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
The only solution left is one that sane representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are relentlessly calling for: the formation of two states and Israel’s ceding territories in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue for a decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar are more than ever in a position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, given the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote in the UN, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows reluctance to join the solution to this problem.
This is a disastrously short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Cigarette Packaging Act came into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of diseased body parts are contrasted on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice of the Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of dull olive color with creepy pictures of diseased body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced mandatory from this Saturday - the names of brands that are printed in the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the design of packages of tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to keep young people out of smoking, depriving them of their fashion status.
The study found that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never became smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
“It is obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to convey with the help of packaging,” explains the Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia is one of the countries with the smallest share of smokers in the world, so these changes will not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering taking such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences different from those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, claims that demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has skyrocketed (almost from scratch) since companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal this law two months ago.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and expects a new batch.
This is good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely the part of the population to which these measures are aimed.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from exhibiting cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re selling tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting,” explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations between all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of their adoption of similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory posting of photos warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defiantly do not obey the innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“Just pull out a cigarette and put a pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yew, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on the shelves
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, and now it's four hours," he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it’s over, close the store,” he says, throwing his hands up.
Being bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help much here.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in child development are speaking in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which perhaps contributes to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
In the past, I, like many, believed that boredom is an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century.
The question remains, however, as to how we understand boredom.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on this topic and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want, but can not do what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something they’d like to do.
With apathy, you do not want to do anything.
The main thing in the experience of boredom, he says, is “disruption of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is slow.”
The description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we’re bored when we’re actually just having a hard time focusing on something.
In their study, “Unemployed Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading a journal.
Some participants also heard the loud noises of an off-the-record television program included in the next room, others heard the same noises at low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to a voice recording without an extraneous sound track.
Those participants who heard low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, peering into the flow of products on the assembly line in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people begin to sway on a chair or draw scribbles on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not to relax physically.
“The study showed that children who are not forbidden to fidget and spin, learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show varying degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special “boring bias scale.”
To determine the score on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "Much of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I am too much interested, so there is not enough time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He got the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would be similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescence has a peak tendency to boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes it is not, because in extreme manifestations, as studies show, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
“That’s how our brains tell us to do something else; it’s boredom,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this same brain does not always know what is better to do.
If you’re bored and you direct that energy to playing guitar or cooking experiences, you’ll make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will get better only for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will cease to be bored, but he will not learn how to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment, ”says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he says.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom needs to be extolled.
However, to consider it something bad is also not worth it.
Rather, one should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“We see it in a way that we need to be bored more often, even though boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we are used to the constant over-stimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when there is silence, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is unclear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old soccer player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a criminal offense that will soon be perfectly legal across the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar driving a car down the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and possession of a device for drug use - minor offenses, each of which is subject to a $100 fine - and a court date was set.
“We are treated like criminals,” Mr. Orozco says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for several weeks since Colorado voted to legalize marijuana use in small amounts for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the location of the case.
Accusations of minor marijuana-related offenses are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana cases and continue to hold those responsible for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they are voting to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“It’s happening so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of regulatory authorities in Washington state also scratch their heads puzzled.
They will have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for good or ill, is ahead of most other states in settling marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
“There’s a more orderly market in Colorado, so they’ll set a good example,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Board.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than to put forward some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could be guided by,” he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and put the state into a state of uncertainty for a year, when the state licensing system is not yet in place and marijuana ownership is already legal.
But there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state order on “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trading it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses within cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly established marijuana legalization center research group.
On November 21, Aurora police chief Oates sent an email to his subordinates saying that the city’s prosecutor’s office would no longer hold people under the age of 21 accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police would stop incriminating people about these violations “starting from now on.”
Oates, the police chief, said police would monitor the city’s compliance with regulations governing medical marijuana growers and would prosecute drug traffickers and distributors.
The Weld County attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office would continue to prosecute possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 people have been charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also accused of other violations.
“It is our institution’s duty to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, are no longer prosecuting adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already open cases related to the possession of marijuana.
“I believe it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the decision, incorporating marijuana for entertainment into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different places of the state revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the experiment of the state with marijuana.
“There’s a cultural barrier to this,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana offenders and a local representative for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve been chasing people for so long that they can’t really accept that it’s not a crime anymore,” he says.
Colorado and Washington — the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana in the same way as alcohol — are destined to become an experimental field nationwide to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are wary of waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, which still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will concede on the issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government in most cases approved the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
DEA agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabet, a former counter-narcotics adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on opening new stores selling marijuana, which could not have opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position where we give someone a license, and then it’s going to cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
The city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks at the history department of Oxford University Worcester College in the late eighties, I packed my bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and wept.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the crushed cups.
Actually, it wasn't all that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically bullied and bullied.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I was in private school.
I was bullied for only one reason, and in this illustrious cradle of enlightenment it looked like real barbarism and blind bigotry: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You might ask, why think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who adhere to right-wing views is subjected to the same persecution.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Cambridge's Corpus Christi College's student club say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel like unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the college's equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary about politics in the student environment “Wonderland: young, smart and right”, in which conservatives were presented as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rides in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit, and a cane with a silver braid.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made "scapegoats because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice president of the Conservative Association of the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in the university environment, there is an increasing bias towards left-wing views.
People who don’t even know us think of us as the brazen and unpunished children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College who has been petitioned for more protection, calls the atmosphere “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of Oxford University’s Conservative Association, says the student club’s attitude toward right-wingers has deteriorated significantly.
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate and the normal lives of club members,” she said.
For the first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was rife with hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university voted to strip former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to budget cuts for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the early days of freshman week, when the students get to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was waiting for me ahead.
I did not know that teachers not only looked past their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but also took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues — the miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s opposition to sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa — have penetrated the wood-paneled walls of audiences.
At my first seminar I needed to translate the eighteenth-century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was difficult for me, I stuttered.
Harry Pitt was a very grumpy man with a cake-like face.
"Teachers don't learn French in principle, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, if you are not very busy, rotating in society,” said Pitt.
I went back to my room completely miserable.
That night in college, I was sitting at lunch alone; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year English student who introduced himself as a member of the University's Conservative Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being conservative will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most freshman Conservatives pretend they're Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I tried to be cowardly.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied at Eton himself, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
How do conservatives have sex?
- They're stabbing each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years for me began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up at college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettiness, and commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ house in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were adopted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said grumblingly.
- They can't do that, except in the city of dormant spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved flawlessly.”
His wet eyes are clouded.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week during a seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me an “enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In my heart of shame, I confessed that “my parents brainwashed me,” and called them “old fools.”
The rest was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was destined to be hammered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't come out, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me cry and rag.
But at eighteen, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation as a university that values equality and freethinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of “Valentino: Master Sewing”, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is Garavani's "Il Signore", but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, abound personal letters and photos signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the modest tailor from the city of Voguera in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elite”.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
“At least they don’t extinguish the cigarette butts of their cigarettes on your gorgeous carpet like some great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitza.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all really enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains Thiessen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza representing Valentino
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in the Plaza de Espana in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
“Valentino made each of his guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Paris Fashion Week.
“He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
A parade of pedigrees
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been turned into a glamorous sixty-meter-long leather podium that offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must defile on the podium, contemplating "viewers" of dreams that sparkle with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a suit that was used by Monica Vitti.
In this audience of models shine names such as Sibylla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abaskal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as a first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
These were pants, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abaskal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light in them and they "fit" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and trendsetter Patricia della Jovampaola d’Arenberg also can’t forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets.
That time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linh.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, a "corsage" in the fold and a cutout without straps.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories accompanying it."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make this outfit from ivory silk with pearl inlay, twelve kinds of various laces and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the upper world."
Fooled by the elite’s “lifestyle” for many years, Valentino is now its best representative himself.
Cavalier of the Grand Cross (a badge of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), Cavalier of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his refinement, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance,” says Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He sat at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was perfect, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make their living by mining sulfur in the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
Plucking huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, piles the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up a steep rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2.386 meters high, only 250 meters, but it takes emaciated loaders more than 40 minutes to climb a turtle step, struggling to keep balance and gently groping the road so as not to stumble and not to fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France, who fell several years ago from the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah-Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur mined
Once upstairs, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company placed just above, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical industries, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“Since the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily carryings.
He spends three hours on each of them and feels broken at the end, however they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While this seems like a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day are paid for coffee collection and the average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the loader, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are some Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes get teary because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking his life in Kawah Ijen, whose gray has already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes get teary because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
That’s the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’ll work two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel porter, but instead he does the job of mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to flow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glitters in the midst of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such hardships.
In fact, they do not receive even a fraction of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photography fee that, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance ticket, the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
“This work is for livestock, not for people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old stock carrier who has spent three decades on Kawah Ijen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate work “as much as he can”, because he needs money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because a volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that none complains of their severe illnesses... more serious, obviously, than their habitual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pains and shoulder ulcers that have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Uninik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades remove 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because a volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and housing and education prices for the lack of children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint tortilla ads, but despite that — or perhaps because of it — this video became a YouTube hit in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao (bulk) in the stove" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do "their national duty."
This thing is purely for the internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of reproduction of our own kind, so we felt that this is a topic that we should touch upon.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing quick dating parties (blitz dates).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Who doesn’t take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - which is known as the replacement percentage - was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of the National Population Authority’s Couples and Families Policy Division, says the reason is “improved education” and “wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to weddings and creating a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies that aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline are causing resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites where barely hidden xenophobia is rampant against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and not wanting to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party scored its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have a known impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development guidelines have shifted to controlling the number of small apartments known as “shoesboxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46-square-meter apartments sell very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a bachelor lifestyle and deprive developers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of homebuilder EL Developers, says their shoe boxes are selling much faster than the more spacious ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide clearer guidelines for developers who used to put up obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his early 20s.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the Singaporeans have the final say.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is about the property of private or “the sphere of private life, which have the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations on the Internet that he probably wouldn’t share outside the Internet?
elPeri?dico interviewed five children aged 10 to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
On four occasions, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal realm, and "password and username" when applied to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB, I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I am also having fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who’s behaving stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just download them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends quickly,” he points out.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't consider someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example,” he points out.
According to the boy, no one rubbed into his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If I get pressured or demanded, I’ll just remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is today known as cyber mobbing.
A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Just turned on the privacy."
It then explains the sequence of steps for setting up an account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyber mobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Mariellos Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means to find information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning,” she says.
This topic is difficult, because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or can not be distributed, published or said, at an age when maturity is not enough for this.
“Also, they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or, would you like it if they published a photo of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask for permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you are doing in every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, so it should be in social networks,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,” he says.
According to Gaurdius, the key question is to remind children to "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, previously declared and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI ordinary meeting of heads of state and government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the presidential administration indicated on the main page that it will be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the contents had been laid out by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was limited all the time.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without a sound was broadcast in the press hall with the message “closed meeting, sound is prohibited”.
Some of the information that circulated among the reporters was relayed by the spokespersons of some UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but we are talking about the statement of Umala, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American-Arab Summit (ASPA), and at that time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague hearing statements by both sides, as part of the charge that Lima has brought against Santiago.
"We will abide by and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals,” Piniera added, and welcomed Umala’s handshake against the background of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia protested this week the Bogota Pact, under which it recognized submission to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it found to be erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and for closing the summit, just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects were approved for action among South American countries, the amount of expected investments amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements.”
He said action was being taken to improve “cooperation against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America, and taking into account the combined and effective manner of natural disaster risks.”
As Europe is in crisis, "economic unification (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis, but should serve to expand our production base and anticipate a better future for our cities," Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in the village and border zones ... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a readout of the meeting.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five referred to Peru, and were limited to cross-axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful way about the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogota.
“The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also during the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc preliminarily met to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter is suspended.
Peru has an interim presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other clashes, "but now they are almost the same fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the UNASUR countries.
“It is necessary to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President had also shown himself to be a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who had signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision, because with him he did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not be respected by the process."
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning regarding an alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What is really there is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the possibility of doing exercises in the air.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that there were talks in London to find a solution to the problem of imprisoning the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use the word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
He added: “If the UK gives a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows, and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate “mediocre, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
“The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt villains-politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this aspect, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, “neither the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemon countries dominate in Ecuador,” and added that, having been re-elected, he would “deepen the revolution in order to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR until at least the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of the rule of law," because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also said that the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, was “fully justified”.
At the moment, this decision is not respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together in order to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over maritime borders, which is being conducted in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to apply to international bodies if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be.”
Regarding the opportunity to stand as a candidate in Ecuador's upcoming presidential election to run for a third consecutive term, he said he was considering the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it's quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations like Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, that would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment that was already scheduled, routine, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean an aggravation of President Chavez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was announced that his AIDS test had tested positive.
“I was stunned,” he recalls that difficult moment, despite all the tact of the doctor.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts were justified - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He has been living with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too few treatment options existed then, too little was known about the disease, too biased towards patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut.”
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without worsening the quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, has “exhausted” their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “a big achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” said the head of the HCG HIV department, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectious disease specialist and expert on HIV/AIDS, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system available to patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when 500 CD4 are reported.
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although deaths have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that 60 percent of patients in the national database have died since the advent of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
"Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some kind of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who ask for it."
Experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree in their proposal, as well as patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for verification, motivated only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather nag three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, said in a statement.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gap between health programs and ordinary citizens is wide, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has tackled the issue of HIV.
The biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, “actually increased condom distribution, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with chicanery and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health workers, which teenagers do not want to hear, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not only behind the counters and that a hundred of them be in vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
It's not encouraging promiscuity.
It’s not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if condoms could be distributed under his guidance.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 reported cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections relate to the genital tract, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people for every reported case who do not know about it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that annuls the Vitro Group's debt restructuring achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms, which are allowed by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlene Hale in the Northern District of Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of seizing their property across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to a leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies as evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be regulated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding concerns a bankruptcy proceeding pending in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without inter-firm voting, recognized in the critical mass of bankruptcy proceedings debts that had before the parent company branches of Vitro, would not have achieved the majority necessary to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro wasn’t the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Industries.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the affiliates, the creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the United States courts, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional, and Liverpool Limited, would not reach a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by a severe economic crisis that has overtaken the United States in hitting the country.
So far, the firm of the Gonzalez Sada family will appeal the decision to the appellate court itself, so that the vote reached its plenum, that is, five judges, due to the fact that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be filed, which will require a review of the process by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae (“friend of the court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it exempts itself from complying with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country obeyed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambole from two sides: they hit in the Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
Given the months-delayed complaints posted on the table by Mexicana de Aviacion unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The agency, led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 bank trust of IXE on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be used to purchase shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Gathering over the weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant center of sales and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products isolated country, with a living area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that leveled part of the protected areas and pose serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government's rejection of the Senate's demand to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already gone into the archives.
As you know, the action was carried out, despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the opportunity to consider it as violating freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a brain haemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-category player, Major Basketball League player, BSN commissioner and BSN executive with the Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of the BSN, CEO of the National Team and president of the federation in the 90s,” Reyes recalls during Primera Hora’s visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabelle, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his path through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These have been my best years, which I have enjoyed the most because I have had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey made his BSN debut.
From that moment on, Kuko Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the leader,” Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, saying to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Want to?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our top bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already listed as the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsi’s achievements in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time against the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez, and Piculina (Ortiz) play on that team again, but also young (Javier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitner in return for players suspended for disorder in the Mar del Plata Pan-American Championship, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level the way Piculin did.
And that doesn’t include his career in the various leagues he’s played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s there were up to 17 teams in the BSN season.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and this is unnecessary.
At the very least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon-predator J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night due to complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas-based production studio.
“Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he most enjoyed,” the family said in a statement.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original personality and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and has admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television for his role as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl, played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
A CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who shot J.R.?”, designed to create hype around the episode, full of emotions, in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most watched entertainment program in history, following the 1983 MASH finale, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put on treatment.
"I know what should be on the J.R. gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who were lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new release of “Dallas” were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman leaves.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who excelled in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on New York's theatre stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memoir, Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t include anything that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and after,” he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He has also been active against smoking and has been involved in several campaigns.
Begins a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharma decided to teach a course about the end of the world, he knew he had irresistible bait: the end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people grasped as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was coming in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some have called “long-armageddon,” and the growing conflict that is dragging Israel into, a place where Christian doomsday theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharma told Rutgers-Camden University students this week.
If you analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we have only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on “the end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course on Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We are analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions are suggested.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell the students what’s possible, probably plausible and impossible,” Walker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to teach a course called simply "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must study, prepare projects and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The seats ended in two hours," Restall said of his course for students with a high average score, which 35 students enrolled in.
We received e-mails for many weeks before the semester started from people asking if there was still room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach this,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed — let alone the professor — said they believed in the end of the world date of December 21.
“Our first project involved a Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“Other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote, referring to the order of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that there had long been talk of many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are cautious about this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call one of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
