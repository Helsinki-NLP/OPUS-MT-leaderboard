I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom is smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Tell a wise man to make a mistake, and he will thank you. Tell a fool to make a mistake, and he will offend you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything there.
Express your opinion clearly.
They don't know us.
Tom must have forgotten to tell Mary about it.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?

She always has time after lunch.
The lander occupies a smaller portion of the earth's surface.

I'll help you tomorrow.
This story amused me.
Careful with your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?

It is better to die standing than to live on your knees.
Tom is waiting.
Tom likes everyone.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They elected a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one.
Tom told me he was alone.
This is the church we are married to.
I don't think Tom will be absent.
I think that's logical.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
He was popular with voters.
Tom did not take the credit from the French.

You're someone's friend?
Tom is too tired to work.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty convincing, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.

Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.

I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
Tonight will be pretty cold.
I'm not asking Tom for help.

You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit him there.
Put it down.

Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going for a picnic.
We couldn't buy concert tickets until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I'm Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
Tom needs you here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot know the pleasure of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a cola and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom happily agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Is everything okay?
Maybe you're the only one who can do that.
Who is not right?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, God!
Tom nodded.
He was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary who did it.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how to do it.
Drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began at 5 p.m.
Mary said she likes to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I have only been to Tokyo once.
I got an electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do it.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are pleased with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She was crying bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
She'll find out.
A witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is done.
When I walked into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom threw out his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We have to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll take a bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Spring is coming.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We have to invent a secret language.
Do you plan to stay for a long time?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking of you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn’t know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.

I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine.

John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it myself.
Tom wiped dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The following month, Tom leaves Boston.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Every year, millions of people die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
All in chocolate.
They moved to another religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just got a haircut.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I’ll buy a new car.
It's our own fault.
You're so cute.
It will cost about fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory is worthy of attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
That's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.

Do you think there's a chance this will happen?

I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We have to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy the flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon at night.
I got it up on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have a right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with the boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London is foggy.
I'm really glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to escort him.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't get angry.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brazil.
What I really want is to sleep.

You deserve to rest.

Listen to his honest opinion.

Tom never had to learn much.
How's your woman doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.

Tom's neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a yobaan asshole.
Tom handed you something for me?
I would never have been able to do that without your help.
I always have coffee and snacks for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.
I'm the best.

I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!
Maybe I was wrong.

Do you understand French?
I bought it that week.
Obviously, Tom doesn't talk to Mary.
I have to leave tomorrow morning.
I knew we could find you.
Mary likes girls.
Do you have anything else?
I think you're telling a lie.

What's the guy's name?
I always get up at half past eight.
Did I invite you?
That's what Tom finally did.

Just keep doing what you're doing.
You made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are some exceptions.

Tell 'em I'm exhausted.
I thought Tom wouldn't do that.
How much money do you want?
Tom has changed.
I don’t enjoy traveling in large groups.
Tom has no regrets.
Forgive me, please.
What's in your backpack?
This time we have evidence.

Tom also speaks French.
Aren't you ready to help us?
I doubt that the new proposal will be accepted.
Release her.

Can I try?
I hate to dance.
He knows how to play the flute.
Some animals do not reproduce when kept in cages.

Tom's asleep?
His father was a carpenter.
Someone smart, someone not.

Do you know any cheap hotel nearby?
Taste the cake.
Two times two is four.
No effort to achieve anything.
Want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He retired at the age of 65.
I lost my pen.
I will continue to work.
I was at a meeting yesterday.
Layla's late.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she did it.
I'll be in Boston for a few days.
I've already done that.
I stayed after school to help clean up the classroom.
Everyone wants something.
Does Tom have green eyes?
I always forget people’s names.
Why are you asking me?
I'm just looking.
Tom said he didn't care if he won or not.
Do you speak French well?
You don't really have to do that.
I think Tom's living in Boston right now.
I was scared.
I can read English.
Tom helped me wash the car.
This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I take care of my grandfather.
I'm going to leave around ten in the morning.
You came by train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
In Rome, they act like Romans.
He saw an expression of surprise on my face.
Hurry up, and you'll catch a train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom would actually do it.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell the car.
I just want to measure it.
Tom's car was confiscated.
Could you open the window?
I wonder if Tom is scared.
How well do you know Tom?
You can go.
I have Tom's keys.
Let us in.
I'd like more butter.
Obviously Tom likes it here in Boston.
Tom turned off the music.
The guy I love doesn't love me.
You're very busy.
I'm done for today.
I signed the check.
She gave me a shirt.
Mary trusts me.
Tom returns from Australia next week.
We had a good time yesterday.
Layla saw dreams in Arabic, thought in Arabic, spoke Arabic, and cried in Arabic.
That day will come!
What color are Tom's eyes?
Tom swims well.
You're one of us.
It's very nice of you to help me.
Choose a certain event that you remember well.
What are you gonna have?
Tom has a good alibi.
I'll treat you.
He fucked her.
I don't think Tom wanted to do it himself.
Hello!
Buy me a bike.
The party is in full swing.
Tom's not helping me.
Do you agree with us?
Entomology is not just about learning how flies fly!
Tom didn't want to read a book.
I'll be outside.
If you come here again, I'll call the police.
I know it will be difficult.
Did you get permission to park here?
Anyone can do that.
I'm terrified of how tired I am.
It's time for us to go.

Both Tom and Mary looked at John.
Tom said Mary needed to do it.
She managed to get the truth out of him.
You've already done it.
I'm fed up with your nonsense.
What are you teaching?
Tom is not dead yet.
Tom looked under the couch.
I'll find a way to do it.
Hey! Don't run by the pool!
They met in the classroom.
Tom has good manners.
English is not my native language.
Stop Tom.
Tom wanted to listen to Mozart.
Tom, what do you want for dinner?
Stupid to teach the dead to count.
You were wrong.
Tom's car ran out of gas.
I'm running out of money.
Tom has a decent salary.
I will answer one more question.
I'm going to work right now.
Don't believe everything you hear about Tom.
Spring has come.
I look forward to my own birthday.
Not so much!
I can wait if you want.
I am very grateful for everything you have done for me.
Don't talk to me.
Act good.
Tom apologized to us for being late.
They have twelve children.
How did the exam go?
Can you climb a tree?
You're a smart guy.
Do not open the door to anyone.
The train arrives at the fifth platform.
How many cats are in this house?
I heard you screaming.
What about going to the movies?
Tom is extremely successful.
Why did she want to talk to me?
I often go to Tom's house.
It doesn't bother me.
The boy bowed his heart to the dog.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
Each country has its own story.
The salt is gone.
How do you know when to stop?
Tom is persistent.
Her eyes stopped on the dress.
My father served in the Navy.
