Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “look like Muppets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is growing dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (from the English Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Parliament of Wales) for their name.
A problematic decision is connected with plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour member, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation "is rhymed with Twp and Pwp".
For our readers, not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "kakashka".
According to an Assembly member from the Welsh Party, his organization as a whole "remained dissatisfied" and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close in spelling to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a name change law, issued the following statement: “The final decision on how the Assembly members will be named will, of course, remain with them.”
The Wales Governance Act 2017 empowers the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the option of “Parliament of Wales” instead of “Assembly” has found wide support among the local population.
As for the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee favoured the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Apparently, members of the Assembly offer other options, but it will not be easy for the presiding member, Elin Jones, to find a solution that suits everyone. Recall that the draft law on changes should be submitted in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly's working process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the Committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name "Republic of Macedonia" implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against its northern neighbor's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Harlem parishes: St. Martin’s bells are forever silent
“The old-timers in the neighborhood I spoke to said they used to have bar and church around every corner,” Adams says.
“And now there’s no one else left.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar ceased to be a kind of living room of the whole area, where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, they are concerned that the funds received from the sale of assets will be enough for a short time, no matter how much their leaders hope. “Sooner or later they will be left with nothing.”
On the site of the church, he added, there will be an apartment building, whose residents are unlikely to support the parishes that have survived in the area.
“Most buyers of these apartments will be white, and this will bring the day when such churches will finally close, because the new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was bought by a black parish located in the neighborhood.
When the Church of St. Martin passed into the hands of the black community, it was headed by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main shopping artery of Harlem, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered significant damage, and during the restoration work, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "bells for the poor."
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it otherwise: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical tool.”
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the St. Martin's Carillon that was the world's first instrument of its kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's Church still hasn't found a replacement for him.
Over the past few months, St. Martin’s Church has faced a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The congregation, the parish's governing body, which includes secular leaders, turned to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would "try to shift the cost of the work" to a congregation of parishioners, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors directed by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who fished for lobster
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with KSWB-TV station (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with friends and about half an hour later heard the boy’s cries for help. Together with friends, they sailed by boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was loudly pleased with the capture of the lobster, but quickly "understood that he was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Arriving at the diver, Hammel remarked that "he had completely torn skin around his collarbone."
“I screamed to get everyone out of the water, ‘Here’s a shark!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of Redi (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked the teenager is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was spotted at the site a few weeks ago, but it was not classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper torso.
Authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablada to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure public safety.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to conquer the perfume and cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury is going to install cosmetics and perfumery departments in the stores of Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams with consultants and cosmetologists, according to the model of luxury department stores.
The UK perfumery and cosmetics market is valued at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to expand, while in fashion and home goods sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this coveted market, spacious cosmetics and perfumery departments will be presented as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, and if successful next year, they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves, previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens, household goods, and investment in the perfume and cosmetics market seems to be a good solution.
According to Sainsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3 thousand items, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in dedicated locations, by type of organization of goods in Booths stores.
In addition, the Butik-Cosmetics branded product line will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two of Sainsbury's stores will feature Fragrance Shop's perfume stalls: the first one has already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second one is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
E-commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food for each day in small shops near the house led to the fact that supermarkets are forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket chain is fighting for buyers in a competitive battle with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of supermarkets in Sainsbury have Argos outlets, and some now have Habitats stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to increased sales of food products and revenue from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized between Sainsbury and Booths, but later disagreements arose between the participants in the issue of dividing the income from the sales of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Sainsbury (a total of 281 stores) to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care products La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's ?11 million exit
The star of the show “Dragon’s Lair” Peter Jones “angry” with the release of TV presenter Holly Willoughby from the transaction for 11 million pounds, which she intended to conclude with the lifestyle brand of Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with “Marx and Spencer” and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their co-branded homewear and Truly accessories.
The business of this pair was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
37-year-old presenter of the program “This morning” announced its decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV enraged Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Lair.
According to our sources, Jones was “angry” when a favorite of viewers during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after the conclusion of new contracts worth up to 1.5 million, she will not have enough time for their common brand of home clothes and accessories True.
Their brand was compared to the brainchild of actress Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and it was expected that its sales will double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram, Jones himself left the UK on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure its carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision has stymied all parties to the deal.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because before the launch of the brand remained a few weeks.
At Marlowe headquarters, there was a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host “This morning”, one of the most popular stars of the UK, can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as a potential delay in the launch of the line.
In addition, we are talking about the rupture of long-standing friendly relations.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created the brand True with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over the company’s board in March.
Both couples often spend their vacations together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of the company's shares in the television production company Dan Baldwin.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I Am a Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said last night: “We cannot comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiations, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that the media will fall on him because of the “unworthy president” of the comment and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump drop so many complaints?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in a second meeting, after Trump called their first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho addressed world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea was still waiting for “relevant response” from the US after the DPRK’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation with North Korea is great,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have borne fruit: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been released and American servicemen who remained in the territory of the DPRK have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy is not strange.
“Behaving like the president is so easy, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street rushing into this completely packed hall, there would only be 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: recorded catastrophic damage, victims numbering in the hundreds
In the early days after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told there was no need for their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost their homes, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing the team for shipment to Palu, but we don’t yet know if the foreign team will be able to work locally.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu in order to determine the appropriateness of involving international organizations.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains woefully ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, no siren was turned on in Palu to alert the population, which most likely resulted in so many casualties.
Transportation between numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously moored in Lombok to help earthquake victims, is heading to Palu, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the strengthening of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the main focus of his election campaign and spent countless funds on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for escalating sectarian feuds between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows with arrows and other arrows.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea with a goal in the far top corner of the gate
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and hit the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and ended up in the far upper corner of the net.
Goalkeeper Kepa Arrisabalag jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Sturridge said, "It was all about being in that position and getting the ball, players like Shake always play to the maximum, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible."
“I saw Kante coming towards me, took possession of the ball and, without thinking twice, hit the goal.
At the end of the first half of the match, the Chelsea team led with a score of 1-0, the goal in the 25th minute was scored by the Belgian Eden Azar.
The central striker of “Chelsea”, passing the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, through the middle of the field broke through half of “Liverpool”.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic played a one-touch game.
Next, he passed the pass on the move to Azar, who went out on the gate.
Hazard overtook the defense and struck from the left flank bypassing Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, hitting the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will meet the Napoli team at the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play with the club “Videoton” in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will be held on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed it in Indonesia reached 832, the National Disaster Management Agency said on Sunday morning.
Under the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, many people remain. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of more than 380 thousand people was littered with debris of collapsed houses.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Muse complex on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among local residents.
Detective Inspector O’Hagen said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I strongly urge anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could capture something on a DVR. Please contact us with any information that can help the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found in the compound.
This afternoon, alleged known victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Muse complex tried to walk into his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he heard what had happened, he lost his voice.
Residents of the house were told that they would not be able to get home for at least several hours.
One of the police officers told the tenant that the entire surrounding area is considered a crime scene.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another remained outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to observe the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a private message to the user on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 (case 247 of September 30).
Cromwell's monument in front of parliament sparks heated debate over 'rewriting history'
Cromwell's "expulsion" would be a deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated, "As part of the ongoing debate about the demolition of historic monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Probably Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated, "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, saw Cromwell as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate by experts.
But it is safe to say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure, representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve praise and respect."
Chinese farmer stabbed to death by a pig killer
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer was the victim of a pig, according to local media.
The bloody body of the victim (the media mentions only his surname, “Yuan”) with a torn artery was found near a barn in the market in the district of Lupanshui province of Guizhou in southern China.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Xining District, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered Yuan's lifeless body, with the door to the nearby pigsty open.
There was a huge pig in the pigsty with blood on the snout.
During the forensic examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bitten the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bleeding and maimed,” Wu, a relative of the victim, told the Guiyang Evening News.
Video from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate squad during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan’s family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer’s death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal nailed a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let him go, only afraid of his wife.
In 2012, there was a case when a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their latent aggression as a “trigger”.
Pigs are playful,
they are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just need to instill in your animals a sense of proportion and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rains to a significant part of the South-West of the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing power, moving through the zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring rains and floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone had reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, being 360 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of Baja California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the southwestern United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, trapped in the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the South-West in the coming days.
Precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity of the air, the precipitation rate can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mainly in most of Arizona, is expected to 5-10 cm of precipitation.
The risk of sudden fast-growing floods is not excluded due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
With the current risk of tropical rains, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Rainstorms can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause gusty winds in some places and raise clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low pressure zone, rainstorms will fall in places on the coast of southern California.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause small mudstone flows and create slippery surfaces on roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning in Arizona in some places will be tropical rains, which will spread to other areas in the evening Monday and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will be in the Four Corners area and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, there will be sharp temperature changes throughout the United States, due to the low air temperature in the Arctic at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be especially noticeable in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern territories of the United States, warm weather is expected in early October, the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the space from the Southern Plains to the North-East of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with high probability an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing on the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was watched by more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazy Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, on Thursday attracted the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six TV channels.
The political standoff surrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Flake put forward a condition that the charges against the lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
Ford told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that she was "100 percent" sure that Kavanaugh had attacked her intoxicated and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers watched Friday’s debate.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison, we are talking about the average audience watching the match of American football in the playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: the Senate hearing, which lasted all day, was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had an audience of 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, and MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
After the hearings, interest in the case did not wane.
On Friday, there was a real drama with Jeff Flake.
After a senator from Arizona, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support the candidacy of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS managed to capture on camera, as on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake faced in the elevator with a group of activists who brought criticism on the senator.
The whole world saw him, lowering his eyes, getting whipped by angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one of them said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“There is power behind you, while so many women are powerless,” the women tried to explain their position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on this topic at a meeting of the committee. The elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all TV channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake made one condition — to conduct an investigation of the FBI on these charges against the candidate by next week, as sought by the democratic minority.
Flake claims that he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Senator from Democrats Chris Koons.
He made the final decision by talking to Koons and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect, as it was apparent that Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
By presidential decree, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of “political games” around the situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting partisan interests above the interests of society.
The British Prime Minister arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on the same page with May, former foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called plan “chess” in the framework of Brexit, saying that he considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous”.
Death of Wade Sims in shootout: Police arrest Dayeon Simpson on suspicion of killing Louisiana State University forward
Police have arrested a man suspected of murder in the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge police said Dytheon Simpson, 20, had been arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, a regional CBS channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
According to the publication Advocate, for Simpson set a pledge of 350 thousand dollars.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that the death was caused by a through-and-through gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The department is grateful to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the local residents who assisted in the operational-search activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at Louisiana State University, thanked the law enforcement for their “good work in catching the criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the Louisiana State University team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds on average per match.
Team coach Will Wade issued a statement Friday morning, saying Wade Sims' tragic death caused "shock" and "real grief" at all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
Volcano covered with ash Mexico City
Volcano Popocatepetl covered the ashes of the southern suburbs of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended the population not to approach the volcano: activity was recorded in its crater and 183 combined-cycle emissions were produced per day.
According to the observations of the Center, near the volcano often rumbled and felt trembling.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users posted photos of the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash.
After a 7.1 Mw earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl volcano (or, for its own, "Don Goyo") is an active volcano since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of first anniversary of independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona held a rally dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the secession of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps. Not without clashes between supporters of independence of autonomy and police; six rioters were in custody.
Police officers pushed back pro-independence protesters, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powder paint at the police, lifting clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police used batons to restrain the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed vigor.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted: “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!”, and their opponents answered them with the slogan: “Long live Spain!”.
According to local press reports, fourteen protesters were hospitalized with minor injuries.
On October 1 of last year, a referendum was held on Catalonia's secession from Spain. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government, but it became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tension remains in the region striving for sovereignty.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to secede from Spain, but turnout was low due to the fact that opponents of the exit mostly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year almost 1,000 people were injured when police tried to block the referendum at polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, separatists took the night off a demonstration in support of Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but took a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termez, who attended a separatist rally in the company of his wife, laments that the hope of Catalonia gaining sovereignty is becoming increasingly shaky.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying with happiness, having the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in limbo,” he said.
In the recent December local elections, Catalan parties in favour of secession from Spain won an important victory, albeit by a small margin. However, this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either on the run or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police rally on the phone, said the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders held in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next European Parliament elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: the car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was hit several times by a car; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39 years, were taken under arrest.
The collision was made on Thursday at about 19:30 local time in the district of Ballinagard Crescent.
As a result of the ram, the gate and the building itself were damaged, according to the inspector of the criminal police Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that a shot from a bow could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's apt goal
The first goal of Dolly Menga brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingston team
Thanks to the score, Livingston won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Steven Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menggi's exact kick equalised Gary Holt's team with Hibernian's club in the standings, where they share second place.
The Gerrard club remained without a victory on the road this season of the Premier League. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, the Harts, from which the Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will play on their field the Europa League match with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
The Livingston Club continues its unbeaten streak in the division, having already played six games and received no defeats since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Lost moments for Livingstone in a fight with assertive guests
Coach Holt's wards had to keep score from the very beginning - the Rangers clearly did not cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not work out. Then the defender Alan Lithgow, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball of Keig Halkett to get into the net.
The host side allowed the Rangers to play out in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That’s how they missed that important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer to Menge, who scored from a central position.
By that time, the Rangers had an advantage in possession of the ball, but the host team's defense was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued on the same pattern, although Kelly still had to fend off a blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman, and Lithgow made a wide pitch out of the standard position.
The balls were constantly hitting the Livingston penalty, but all attacks were repelled, and two penalty requirements — one for provoking reserve player Glenn Middleton by Halkett and the second for playing by hand — were not met.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingstone" - analysis
From BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, report from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympus.
Their style of play and composition have hardly changed since their rise to the top of the rankings, and coach Holt’s great credit is that he has mobilised this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a superbly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall from relaxing.
At the same time, the Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
Although they had some good moments with Coach Gerrard, this time they didn’t live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they lacked possession of the ball, and they managed to get through the defense of the host team only once. The Rangers, who fell to the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Cool reception of Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was beautiful weather, and both top officials were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany to forge relations between the two NATO member countries — a visit already fraught with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 crowds from entering the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan settled nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn in a loud voice both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the ambiguous essence of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of the city of Depforth, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver fled.
Police in London say they are working to identify the victim and notify his immediate family.
In the meantime, roads are blocked at the scene and the route of buses is changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Riots in Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured
According to the Long Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the rioting at the men's maximum security prison.
In the men's maximum security prison of Long Lartin (Wustershire), riots continue from Sunday, which began around 09:30 local time.
A Tornado task force was called in to quell the riots involving eight inmates from the same wing.
The police received minor injuries to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided with medical assistance on the spot.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were involved in resolving the incident at the Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our facility, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for a longer period.”
Long Lartin currently holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the governor of the prison was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison authorities were forced to engage special forces units to calm the raging prisoners who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely falls into the zone of passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is “lucky”: at the beginning of next week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last breakthrough, should pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday evening.
The bureau of the National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that just “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status, being within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Weather Service, from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation will fall, sometimes reaching 15 cm on the Arizona plateau of Mogollon Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, precipitation is possible up to 2.5-5 cm, in places precipitation can reach 10 cm.
For areas that will be bypassed by torrential flows, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although torrential floods can be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season not taking place in the Southwestern United States.
According to the maps of the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of the territory of Arizona is at least a severe drought (the second most severe category),” reports the website weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, with a top speed of 137 km/h, is located 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category “tropical storm”.
It is expected that in some areas of Mexico there will be heavy rains with the threat of floods.
“In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonora can fall up to 7-10 cm of precipitation, in places up to 25 cm,” reports the website weather.com.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the border with Arizona in the category of tropical cyclone. From Arizona, it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is associated with heavy rains in Baja California, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in desert areas of the southwestern United States,” the National Weather Service said.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects arrested in attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager was seriously stabbed. On suspicion of attempted murder detained three teenagers and 20-year-old boy.
The victim of the attempt with serious injuries was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as "stable".
That evening, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime, who have any video of what happened on a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: Kavanaugh Has 'All the Hate, All the Wrath' of the Democrats
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his associates in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all the hatred, all the malice” of the Democratic Party collapsed.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in an emotional address categorically rejecting the accusation of Christina Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago, when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during a hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the US president said that that day "the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an untainted state record,” the president announced to a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly touched on the issue of Kavanaugh’s nomination, speaking about the importance of Republican turnout for the elections to the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important election of our lives is only five weeks away.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different sense,” he said.
“I wear it like a tan and fight for our great candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all their might.”
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate on the confirmation of Kavanaugh’s candidacy should take place no later than Friday, said an assistant high-ranking representative of the Republican Party.
Earthquake in Indonesia claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many carried away by giant waves that seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible force of tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday at sunset, the coast was overtaken by waves almost six meters high, which swept everything in their path and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach holiday, instead of immediately running into shelter, and lost their lives because of it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an official with Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Authority, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, there were cars, logs, whole houses in the water flow, the element destroyed everything in its path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and hit the coast with all force.
Some of those present climbed the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photos of the disaster management department show destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by tremors.
A series of earthquakes occurred on the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the energy release caused by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected, due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “massive,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Palu, in the town of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with Dungal were "completely destroyed, no information was received".
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dungal area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“There was a tragedy, but this is not the limit,” — said in a statement.
On Saturday, the Authority came under heavy criticism, as it did not report the arrival of the tsunami in Palu in time. Authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
An amateur video appeared on social media in which a man on the top floor of a building screams about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water collapses on the shore, taking with it entire houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major power outage, causing communication to be lost in Palu. This made rescue operations of the services very difficult.
Military transport planes with humanitarian aid have been dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and essentials, government sources say.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian aid; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents broken in the yard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, a terrifying picture of complete destruction appeared on the way to their eyes.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to get to Palu.
Indonesian law allows the attraction of funding, humanitarian assistance and employees of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the place where the disaster struck, a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is believed to be a local disaster,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Palu, friends and relatives of the people listed as missing are still hoping for their miraculous salvation, which will return the population to faith in the best.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued after falling into a sewer hatch.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother’s lifeless body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paragliding coach, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel included his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Hendon remembers learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel from other paragliders, for the next hours he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Palu, vacationing at the beach festival, via WhatsApp.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray check mark, not two blue ones.
“This means that messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Theft $26,750 while servicing an ATM in Newport-on-Levy
On Friday morning, the attackers stole $ 26,750 from the Brink's incubator, which runs one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Liby, according to a press release from Newport police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus was taking cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex, and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, “an attacker ran to Brink’s employee from the back” and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “Personality formerly known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has long carried this pseudonym and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news comes ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album, Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as a co-host instead of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, the author of the program reports.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only an abbreviated version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means 'you,' 'you,'" West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am we.
First there was Kanye, which means “the only one”, and now I am just Ye, that is, a reflection of everything good, bad, incomprehensible in us, everything at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye isn’t the first famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P Diddy or just Diddy, this year asked to be called Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Brother Love" or "Brother Love").
Speaking with West rapper Jay-Z also changed the spelling of his name several times: with hyphen and without, capital letters or lowercase.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking in Tlatelolco Square on Saturday, President Lopez Obrador vowed to "never resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and the massacre began, killing 300 people. This happened against the background of the strengthening of leftist student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also pledged support for Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of study prospects lead young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI
China and its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts should not be underestimated — the U.S. should double investment in its scientific developments, said Li Kaifu, an investor and entrepreneur in AI development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier statements about the work on AI were made by several US ministries, although in general the US does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in AI innovations by 2030.
“A doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we expect the next AI breakthrough,” Li said.
A doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in the U.S. Othello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States in the development of artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to scientists in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken any measures in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments struck an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether voter turnout would match the minimum of 50 percent needed to hold the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was formulated as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievskaya, 79, a resident of Skopje.
Sufficient members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it is not legally binding.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority of MPs.
The State Election Commission said there had been no reports of violations by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favor of a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene by placing chairs in front of tents set by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads held high, not beating the thresholds of official offices,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the key to our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Political Studies showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but that is below the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it turned out that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those polled said they would vote positive.
For a referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City bypasses Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cracked down on Brighton's defense, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it seemed that it did not make him any difficulty.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then passed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, while in the penalty area, at one touch returned the ball of Aguero, who with his right foot punched Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan into the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero is having some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero got the ball while deep inside Brighton.
He gave an excellent cut-off on the left flank on Leroy Sanaa.
Sane made a few touches before handing the transmission to Sterling on a long-distance barbell.
The Sky Blues striker scored the goal just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to take away points from the Colorado Rockies
After the Washington Nationals dropped out of the playoff battle, there was no particular reason to force the events.
But the indefatigable Scherzer hopes to win the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, have problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they are still hoping to secure a First Division title.
“And while we’re playing for nothing, we can at least hold our ground knowing the huge importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of the audience and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher for Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation tend to put Scherzer in this role.
Scherzer, who is going to enter the 34th game, threw the ball on the pitch on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his day off, he will be a pitcher.
Washington's right-handed pitcher statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running a race in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the presidential nominee for the Supreme Court.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, although I do run, fighting everywhere for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, and we are witnessing meanness and abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to step over to get power and control, which is what they want to get — power and control, but we’re not going to give them away.”
Democrats, he says, set out to “stand up and stand up.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, nasty and deceitful.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the contents of this document?
Mmm... Mmm... what document?
No, no. Body language has given it away, I have never seen body language so refute words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
She has no tolerance for those who voice their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of no confidence in me, it came as no surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour MP yet to be told that we are not welcome to speak our minds.
The same attitude towards my colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan, because she strongly spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by a vote of no confidence for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe — ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the time out of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC evening Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that differences of opinion are not allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree to — whether it’s national security issues or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly, no matter what I say, there is a tirade of insults on social media calling for the cancellation of elections, condemning the center’s policies, or claiming that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me do tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who every day face a flood of attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never back down.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that so many insults have come to be considered the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that “broad church,” and with each vote of no confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party is already becoming.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations urging me to sit still and speak less, and then I will be fine.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago, as a student at a school outraged by the disparaging attitude of the Thatcher government, which has caused my school class to literally fall apart, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — whether it’s the job of a local MP or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done so in past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to appeal to is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of election cancellation or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I see fit in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated "Er" comes out on top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but without a doubt, the "Ear" has earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Premier League Tennant.
Now they lead the table, the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Murchie the right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” commented Peter Murchie.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth paying tribute to the 'Er', they tried better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, implemented by Fraser Climo, brought the Er forward, but a yellow card issued for the Warriors game to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed the Melrose to come forward, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unfulfilled attempt.
Climo increased Er's lead from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, he earned a point and then scored a single try at halftime, making a 17-5 score in Er's favor.
But the Melroses started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who received a stretch, and after re-exit, "Er" moved on thanks to the attempt of Stafford McDowell, implemented by Climo.
Acting Er captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for an unfulfilled attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of furious pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the advancing mole of Er.
Climo realized the advantage without stopping almost from the very second exit, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent extreme striker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field hosts.
Star Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is going to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script for which he writes, and starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on this information, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was planning to take part in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“Our sea”: landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will again open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are outlined with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Across Bolivia’s landlocked region, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict over resources; alive and eager to sail across the Pacific again.
Those hopes may have been the boldest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of an international court to be held on October 1 as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the peace of mind and, of course, they are waiting for a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice process on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign landlocked Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a tough battle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and if so, it will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to administer Chilean territory and has already said it will not influence the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case “wasn’t complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, Bolivia’s case has not progressed, but on the contrary, all the time was postponed.
“The current Bolivian administration has exploited the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, Morales’ bellicose rhetoric destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to conduct discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, does not agree that the court's decision was rendered too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the naval issue as a political bargaining chip.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to once again make sure that we need to step over our past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is gradually returning to the path of resuming deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ree argues that the dream that long-term sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is utopian.
Washington is afraid to approve this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the newest line of massive headdresses that promise to appear in mass sale, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add hats to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun’s rays, there’s no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a lot of unusual hats, which are part of their SS19 collection and blinded the visitors of Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram followers, and the designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
Distinguished instance of Valentino: the head beige outfit, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included gem-embellished watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, however, all these hats are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had a sewn mouth, and they looked more like a portrait of Hannibal the Lecturer than a creation from couture.
One of the copies resembled equipment for snorkeling with a tube and protective glasses, and the other - melted ice cream.
If you are a fan of fashion, you are in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of making their way into mass selling — right to you.
Hats of enormous size follow the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot-wide margins worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label that released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such wide popularity on social networks, gave rise to and sent another huge accessory to walk on the catwalk - a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit herself carrying this bag.
An orange bag of burnt raffia with a white leather handle and raffia edging became a vivid example of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will go on sale next summer. Since the designer has made such a splash with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: outstanding exam results demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with more than 30,000 students across Scotland seeking to provide the highest level of services to students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, as well as the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are calling to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you turn to his heart.”
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages occupy a leading position in the league tables and have the highest score on the results of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign language learners received a top grade of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an “A” in Mandarin (an adverb of Chinese), while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received an “A.”
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and in other educational institutions.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons employers had difficulty filling job vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will get a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his later life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage — it is spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That’s why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a fairly wide range in terms of languages that are taught - each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in light of the country's future development through 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teaching staff, whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scotland’s independent schools aim to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vital for the future development of the country, so this must be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron to debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The torturous expectation of fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a preseason Sunday match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be seen how much time he will have to play.
"More than one and less than forty-eight," Walton replied on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers preseason games.
“At this stage in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season.”
Trump election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his proposed Supreme Court nomination has been delayed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time will Trump meet in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at hearings this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the post of supreme judge. Trump’s proposal of this candidacy has caused a lot of negative responses, since Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was supposed to take place in the Senate, will be postponed for up to a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this action is to help Republicans entering the November elections to increase the election pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign aims to have these five meetings, to be held next week, help “intensify the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible as we enter a busy campaign season,” said a Trump campaign spokeswoman who declined to be named.
Planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the action could attract supporters from "...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit to this state in the last month, because it was here that he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“The fact that a president has to come to get Morrisey ahead of the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey himself,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. National Team Shows Willingness to Fight and Hopes Going to Doubles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The shifting initiative is an exceptional fictional sports concept, but it is in it that players believe, and at such competitions it is especially pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I guess it’s a small initiative for us,” Jordan said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and twelve more are at stake.
Americans, according to Spit, feel the "wind in the sails", and they have reasons to keep their spirits up, not least thanks to the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleep was adamant from you to the green, which set a personal example.
The winning cheers grew louder as his round continued, driving the deciding ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His kick, which gave them a victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar outcry, one that speaks to his belief in a chance for the American team.
“You need to get together with all your strength and focus only on your game,” said Spit.
That’s all the players have left.
Walk 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Sleep and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four out of four, and they don’t seem to know the mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only couple not to score a boggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the frenzied fans strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player securing a potential victory for Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both in the same spot at the same time.
However, it is premature to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly cracked down on Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggies and two double bogies on the first nine holes dug a Spanishman and a Swede hole, from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It’s so exciting to watch four-ball and four-player games because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange and who deliberately keep quiet, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and made significant headway on the last day, but this session of the fours also showed that the U.S. national team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score in the "Le Golf National" to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team in the four-ball morning games, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they failed to close the gap in the score.
Team Jim Ferrick needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four goals, they then teamed up magnificently to defeat fallen spirits Woods and American rookie Bryson Decebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who went through two Saturday matches, showed periodic glimpses, but now he lost 19 of 29 matches in four goals, and the fours - seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with a score of 2/1, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk, a refreshing day south-west of Paris.
Earned three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a landmark for the Americans.
They earned a decisive 2/1 win over Spain's John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and returned later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy by 4/3 in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team get out of the four-point gap, going alone, given that the Ferik team, as the hosts, needed to play a draw in order to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding the second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increase distrust of the United States and that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing not to build up stockpiles of nuclear weapons or develop nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able to unilaterally take the first steps toward disarmament.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s already-sounding complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for incremental steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to begin a move toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearisation must be carried out first,’ and raises the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal and even objects to ‘an announcement of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, had been a party to this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have ended up in such a dead end.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “suicide missile.”
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said much remained to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a timeline for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and necessarily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006, seeking to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times so far this year, but his latest trip has failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea promised at a meeting held with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, takes “appropriate measures.”
Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax in special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all elementary students learn to sleep more and combat the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to stay awake all night long.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery was made, he got excited about the idea of introducing such a course, having previously made a presentation on the impact of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘I’m sorry I only found out about this now that I’m almost finishing my studies.’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the overall well-being of a person.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, says the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The lesson lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the class offers a picture of a dormitory room, where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, exercisers, and books, get information about how each of these activities and substances — coffee, light, which cause a lack of sleep — affect athletic performance, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages course participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe they have a right to know, just like anyone else has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health,” added Professor Chaisler.
A false sense of pride that a person can “smelle all night” is still fairly common, he said, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, means sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a “secret weapon” for a student to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, causing him to constantly feel hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped develop the course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information across campus.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students set an alarm clock warning that you need to go to bed and wake up, as well as remember the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts a person’s biorhythm and leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng's goal brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another sad away encounter as Dolly Meng's goal led Steven Gerrard's unassembled team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team had hoped to get their first away win since a 4–1 win in St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted only a second defeat of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their spirit, did not seem to be going to level the score.
While Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, and lost only to Hibernian in scoring ratio.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after line judge Calum Spence had to heal a wound on his head after some object was thrown from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that went through the "Ear" to the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same Livy 11 strategy that widened the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be pleased with how his well-oiled line-up squeezed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have led in sword possession, but Livingston squeezed much more when the ball hit them.
They were to score in just two minutes when Meng's first transfer to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs executed a penalty kick on team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to send the ball towards the long-distance bar.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he should have hit a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute he and Stephen Lawless faced, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made only two batters in the first half, but Ibrox's former goaltender, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Coulibaly's head kick, and Ovi Ejaria's weak kick.
Although Livy's first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own labor.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began acting at half-time when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately gave the result when the extreme midfielder gave a pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into their planned game involving Lithgow and Halkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Lithgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
Rangers backup player Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he faced Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, the Geiger counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film Coronado Bells, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — such seemingly unlike scientists — in the lead roles:
Man: "What kind of thing is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms generated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Here, you can hear it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the therapeutic effect of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
As a result of this change, the cells gain the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then the cells must be reintroduced.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one patient who was injected with this vaccine, and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory, after which the altered cells can “see” the protein HER2, characteristic of many types of cancer, then the altered cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, says: “The results we’re getting are hinting we’ve got a very promising vaccine.”
Prof. Berzofsky explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted in taking immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It went bad.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he would retake the post in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost City," which he wore on the "Make America Great Again" cap, the performer delivered a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“I talk to white people very often and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL made a parody show starring Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blasey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Television did not show how the crowd was outraged by West's statement, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear now whether Rock attempted to make fun of West with this move.
In addition, West complained to the public that his cap was ridiculed behind the scenes.
“They were making fun of me behind the scenes.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “They also said my position wasn’t cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a superman coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments caught the attention of the audience at least twice, members of the SNL cast seemed confused, and one person told the publication: “The whole studio plunged into silence.”
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MANY.”
The show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothing, or otherwise supporting his work) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffey and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, we can cite the performer, who recently became a legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as “Prince” (Prince).
Attempted murder charges over a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is best known for his role as sword waving Jon Snow in HBO's brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor hotly criticized the stereotype of the hero-macho, saying that such characters often inspire young people with the idea that in order to be respected, you must necessarily be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of ?MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, admitted that he was “very concerned” about the issue.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge of toxic masculinity due to too muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it that young men are taught on television and on the streets that makes them feel like they only have to show one particular side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest challenges of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, really, something is wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, stating that he had "ended the battles and the horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's re-imagined True West, about the film's producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best finale of Game of Thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this series, so he gave me my family and a further life,” says the actor.
Rose played Igrist, the subject of the passion of the character Keith John Snow in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are sick with these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way was almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that due to conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, transmission is due to inadequate protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information about the leak due to the fault of the senators of the Republican party, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Member of Parliament Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia lawmakers.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims that the lawsuits were forged by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more vile lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators. Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual harassment brought against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and have released information about Waters employees, Hill reports.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent activities was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you’re accused of something you didn’t do, why be angry?
You don't have to make excuses either.
Nor should we be looking into the motives of the accusers.
You have to stay calm and cold.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In a statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent activities.
“We will ensure that criminals are found, and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous for each and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - A Weak Parody of Spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the UK appears in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise “Agent Johnny English”, the production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film “Agent Johnny English: reboot”.
Will the self-ironic picture with the leitmotif “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
At any rate, Johnny English’s rubber-faced goofy profane got his right to chaos a second time — his name most hints that he is a widescreen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a glamorous smoothie, got a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's features and a portion of this guy who contributed one single note to the Chariots of Fire tune in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Initially, this character was created on the basis of the personality of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten television ad Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves a complete chaos.
This latest edition of JE has one or two nice moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades were flapping on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such “serious” film tests as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible” now confidently offer comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is meant for kids, not adults, and for me, Johnny English's quirky misadventures aren't as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson's jokes in the Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker penetrated into the top secret spy British network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the agent on duty - Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and assertive figure already suffering from huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
And then the clumsy Johnny English himself appears on the stage, who now works as a school teacher in some Pontus institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operational work: there are several good jokes here, since English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of “rock”.
English returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former hapless friend Buf, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, reporting to the submarine commander - the role of "fun hockey sticks", in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game due to the fact that in Her Majesty's secret service there were terrible mistakes. They encounter a beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova performed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems — the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farcical jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxurious Volt yacht; English generates complete anarchy, trying to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volt's house.
All these scenes, of course, are a cute and uplifting fiction, but there is something very childish about all this.
Very moderate things.
And as with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan to cut Britain’s working week to four days for a five-day paycheck.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week but be paid five days in advance.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers the savings they gained from the AI revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea “fits” into the economic agenda of the party and will help the population to side with the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to shifting the balance sheets in the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week back during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this desire is not currently endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to flesh out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” of utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current waterway shareholders may not get their entire stake back, as the Labour government can make "deductions" based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and establish Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of chief justice for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, popped up this information, I said, "Did you do it?"
His response was decisive, definite and unequivocal.”
But Graham’s opinion on the vote remained unshakeable.
“I’ve made a firm decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can be changed only by arguments comparable in strength to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing is for sure: Brett strongly denied it all,” Graham said.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses, also could not confirm these facts.
This story is 36 years old.
I didn’t notice anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive stellar lineup with an equally impressive mission to end poverty around the world.
For the seventh year as part of the Festival of World Citizens, tens of thousands of people flock to the large lawn of Central Park, but not only to enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to talk about the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which opened in 2012, is a follow-up to a global anti-poverty project led by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an email to a world leader, make a phone call, or take any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people by freely attending a concert really convincing fellow citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” where people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Organizers of Global Citizen say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million “shares” held by its supporters, which pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that thanks to these actions, world leaders have promised to allocate funds worth more than $ 37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a UK partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to “helping children reach their full potential” has pledged $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the county. This was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens members.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustices about malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracy Ullman, Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through activities designed to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Organizers of Global Citizen say: “It will be a long and difficult journey, where we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York City, with Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman taking the lead.
U.S. could use navy to 'blockade' Russian energy exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that Washington can “if necessary” to resort to the help of its navy to prevent the ingress of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy the way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blockaded so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
Next, he compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister says, calling Russia “a pony with one trick” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration set out to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state interferes with our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully study the possibilities of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will carefully consider the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a City Duma meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it takes a woman up there,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s performance during the meeting: “leading this district in the wrong direction.”
“I’m totally concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump and his nominee for Chief Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren herself do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Policy Studies at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population is more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent support his possible participation in the elections, and 48 percent are opposed.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims that he will make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder Truck Palin at a meeting with voters of Donald trump
Palin, 26, joined the Army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is going through the same thing as members of other families who are suffering from PTSD and have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a slap in the face” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back already different, hardened, wondering whether the same respect turns out to be their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military, as they have done to their country.”
Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the violence and possession of weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that prohibits granting asylum to victims of flight or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note from a court consultant in Washington on Friday supporting an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the “Grace vs. Sessions” lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
The woman claims that her common-law husband “and his sons in a criminal gang” mistreated her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing large numbers of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of application of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Advocates also argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering harm the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor force.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
"Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or because of political beliefs," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never intended to solve absolutely all problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue people in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly dire.
“It’s very difficult right now,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in the wounded.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake have been overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, rested near Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing severe tremors.
He cries, remembering how a strong earthquake destroyed the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he rented with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was squeezed into the debris of the wall, — says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family came to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or our baby.
I hope they survived and they are all right now.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Attacks’ Through ‘Promotional Advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a daily American publication about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of what U.S. officials told Reuters: a new phase in Washington’s intensifying campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, as a result of which they equate tariffs on their countries’ imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war had the task of hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of our cherished American tradition of free speech and a free press by paying and advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could get to know about China’s alarming economic policies, because the local media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He also added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers “trickly disowned” the offer to publish his article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Kavanaugh's difference Republicans push away women voters ahead of interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay on the sidelines and defend the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this situation have heated to the extreme, and a majority of Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
Such things cannot be returned later, writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget about it tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, told Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November ahead!" across from the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond,” non-partisan political scientist Stu Rothenberg said on the news site.
“People say that the situation is already tense enough, and this is true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirm the nomination, this step could cause a response.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat in the dock, but how Republicans handle it, how they treat it,” says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on whether to believe Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more leaning to the side of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony exactly or most likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh most likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake’s urging, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal is to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data stores” or PODs.
It can contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify - all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data.”
According to company CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company has provided the resources, processes, and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make drastic changes that would completely change their business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has been quite influential in the net neutrality debate.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the internet,” Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: Churchman awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918, for his part in the attack on Bellenglis and Leucour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
A monument commemorating the event was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the group forward, and then threw a field gun with one hand, knocking down three soldiers of the unit.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said that “he could hardly do the same heroically, but it humbles”.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the virtue of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be provided by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but were instead shown Peppa's pig
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The table of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six fights of the main program, the fights were broadcast all night live on the 5th channel of UK television.
At 6 a.m., as Geghard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, UK fans were stunned to see Peppa Pig on the screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning in order to watch the fights.
One fan on Twitter called the change to a children’s cartoon “some kind of sick joke.”
“There was a government decree that this content was inappropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked why this happened.
"Yes, Peppa Pig".
Bellator president Scott Cocker said that they plan to schedule the fight so that viewers from the UK can also watch it in the future.
“As for the re-show, I think we can solve this issue,” says Cocker.
“But there’s a Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we won’t be able to solve this issue until Sunday our time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we will do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a lot of text messages were showered, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We’re going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we’re trying to increase that number, but it’s too much.
Yes, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse about his sexuality, but that’s what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a child.
Permanent host of the long-term show Kirsty Young because of illness took a vacation for several months.
Daley, who served as the main guest on Laverne's program, said he felt "more insignificant than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: “Until now, these feelings of insignificance and inappropriateness were real, but they gave me strength and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “meaningful” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took him by surprise."
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that age difference has never been a problem.
“If there’s so much going on in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer who has the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly said that "all his world view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to put up with the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was tickets to the first row of the competition “London 2012”.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be around then and you can’t sit in the front row,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew it was something I’d dreamed of all my life — diving in front of a crowd of fellow countrymen at the Olympics, there wasn’t a better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 am English summer time.
Mickelson, who is out of shape, spent this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to tighten his form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the biennial for a record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick to the bench on Saturday for four goals and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as has often been the case in the United States, the five-time big winner has split his day between watching the game and working on his own playing field in hopes of fixing what bothers him.
Never having the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the hard track of Le Golf National, where a long raff usually punishes for inaccurate strikes.
And if the course itself isn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson will face British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week, in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a strong start, the match of Michelson can be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, although, what else could he say.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He’s a walking Hall of Famer and he’s done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michelson will break the record of Nick Foldo in the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferik said his presence brought the team considerable benefit.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to train people, and he’s a great guy who’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week and it was interesting to see.
His game is so much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a big advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead in singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavorable side.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in Valderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line only slightly ahead with the smallest difference, winning with a score of 141-2-131-2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only for now," said Bjorn, captured in the photo, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and to the whole team that this is not the end.
You'll be all set tomorrow.
Go and do it right.
As long as there are no glasses on the scoreboard, nothing is over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win a trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
“I was not silent, I was focused on 12 of our players, but we know what we’re up against, against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players performed on their uncomfortable golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have outdone myself in this.
Tomorrow we have another test.
Tomorrow, the individual performances begin, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you’re alone there, you’re experiencing all the power of a professional golfer.
This is the idea that players need to be inspired to give their best tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind, and he, too, must make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that individually his players will perform better than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferrick himself went through all this carousel of the last days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing, when Europe held the “Miracle in Medina”.
"I remember every damn word about it," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, rallied his players before the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We built our plan for the game accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in a top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the standings.
“I chose this group of guys, and in that order, because I think that way they will cover all possible shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed again
The German navy’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won’t happen even less next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost increases, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Palatinate, the main ship of the completely new frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies - such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — there should be the option to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The software flaws were particularly critical, as Baden-Wurttemberg-class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to implement updates in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping the newest frigates at anchor are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings of a reduction in German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the navy was effectively “ending up stock of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said the problem had escalated over time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no ships had been provided to replace them.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class could not be taken into service by the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in one of the Scottish Highlands estates, aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and will help in further conservation activities.
The study, organized by scientists at the National Endowment for Scotland, will examine common netopyrs, netopyrs soprano, as well as the brown long-haired bats and night owls of Dobanton inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile terrain surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities for which various groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their landscape-scale behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation advisor, hopes these results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of work on habitat management, such as the formation of grasslands, as well as ways to maintain forest areas in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development works that affect their habitation and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can be dangerous, as well as adhesive tape for flies, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint obstacles in the way of flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat population issues very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, on-site inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave, it’s a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings here, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He recalls the importance of checking for the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance within private domains, since the unintentional destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, baiting or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation officer, urges the public to help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of their individual species live.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape allegations against him, calling them “fake news,” and claiming that people simply “want to prop up” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published charges against the footballer.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video in which the footballer has 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news, says five-time winner Ballon d'Or on camera.
“They just want to be promoted using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they described as “unacceptable information about privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player intends to seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her lap and told her that he was a "99 percent good guy, but fell short by one percent."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and pictures of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear that she would be avenged" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience traumatic feelings inflicted as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United in an alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a ?100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret carmakers lost forever’
Business and Enterprise Minister Greg Clark said the UK would “regret it forever” if it lost its status as a global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on reports that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark says.
The Japanese automaker said that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the fact that, according to automakers, in the absence of a deal within Brexit, supply chains will be put at great risk.
Toyota's production line is launched "just in time", and parts for custom-made cars are supplied by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that industry officials say could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store inventory at its Derbyshire plant for longer than one day, and so production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan, voiced in Chequers, for a future relationship with the EU was "exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make a better deal, which will allow us to not only succeed now, but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers also argue that we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to specify for how long the production will be stopped, but in the longer term warned that additional costs will reduce the plant's competitiveness and, ultimately, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory’s union, says members’ concerns are growing: “In my experience, if we lose those jobs, we can’t get them back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and robust plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House
A responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “transferred to another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of supreme judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstructions to justice by the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general from office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has raised a lot of speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he “would prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI’s complaints about Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But we’ll see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings is not due to "contempt for the community" of television reporters, though she added, "I won't deny that they are playing to the public."
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings answering journalists’ questions than any other president before him,” she added, without giving exact figures, however: “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have had over the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, this is a worthy replacement for press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House, attending open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Conferences for the press are rare.
The president’s frivolous, and at times bizarre, behavior in front of assembled reporters this week in New York may be the answer as to why.
The Minister of health appeals to EU workers in Scotland with a letter about fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health appealed to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude on behalf of the entire country and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to employees less than six months before the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of issuing status applications for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and the expected decision should be made this fall.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
Therefore, I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for head injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury was received shortly before the break.
"He came out to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and carrying him for a medical examination.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury," and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who was just entering his second year, it was Tennessee State's first season after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before dropping out of the game, he successfully intercepted five goals, a total of 18 goals per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra cash raised will be used to help the homeless.
This move will negate the results of Corbyn's attempts to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year in favor of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless - this will be announced today by Theresa May.
The move would nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more affordable and boost citizens’ incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, and the extra funds raised thus should stimulate the government's efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surcharge on the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects that this step will help to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are bought by non-British residents, leading to higher prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to improve their housing conditions afterwards.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of bulldozing property prices by acquiring land but not actually using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to remedy Britain’s “disgraceful housing situation.”
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and ending unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local governments more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-UK citizens as well as foreign companies, property acquisition is as affordable as hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too distant, and the threat for some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland”
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the revival of the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separated from the championship by three points.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden as a child, and it always attracted me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dicka Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not been apprehensive about such authoritative names at such major clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In its structure and capabilities, this club, of course, belongs to the Premier League, ”says the coach.
“It’s not an easy task to get him out there, but I will only do it if I can get the club back.”
Ross served as manager for just three years, becoming assistant manager at Dumbarton first, then spending 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa climb from the third level and the following season brought St Mirren from the bottom positions to the championship winners.
Ross says he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I truly believed that management suited me better than the game.
It sounds strange, because I did everything well, earned good money in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I still feel stress pressured at work, but I feel good as a manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now doing so makes me feel most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Scotland Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consulting firm, said: “Continued solar activity, as well as longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8%, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.
The June decline in restaurant revenues by 1.8% also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results compared to restaurants.
Pubs selling only food were also affected by the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people want to jump out of the street just to skip a drink.
Beverage sales in pubs and bars rose 6.6% month-on-month and food sales rose 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, says: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain critical factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, especially as a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressures.
“The long, hot summer has turned out to be more than ever for operators working with food, and it is not yet a fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give a much-needed respite.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand collapse.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitoring across the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents
According to the survey, one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of pages of “fake insta”
This news has increased concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a “core” account that their parents know about
However, one in five children — some as young as 11 — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in the number of fake insta accounts — that is, Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a primary, “clean” account that their parents have access to, but also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally accessed the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, came across a teenager there who urged others to “rape him.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Principals (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is usually secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “Many teens are eager to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a troubling fact.”
Eileen Doyle will become the “voice of athletes” of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Aileed Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics as a supervisory member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics. Chairman Ian Beatty says the move is a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to take advantage of the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Ailide is highly respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that her participation in Scotland will bring great benefits to athletics,” Beatty said.
Doyle says, “I am committed to being the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as an ordinary commentator on the BBC, after suffering a stroke lost the ability to walk.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I have lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I fully recovered, learned how to walk again and today I do dexterity exercises!
Thank you very much for your support!”
The advertising of the milk pump, in which nursing mothers were compared with cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
The company for the production of milk suckers caused controversy on the Internet, publishing there an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared with dairy cows.
Launching what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a promotional music video demonstrating the freedom that the new breast pump provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full hay barn to a music track that has the words, "Yes, I feed with my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not udder, it's my breasts."
And then the chorus: “We pump, pump, we feed our babies breast milk, pump, pump.”
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within a few days of birth,” writes one user.
Elvie Milk Pump Dresses Directly Under Special Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “It’s clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies for themselves?"
Another user adds, “Advertising is disconnected from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song is “just great.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were to feed a baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but that’s how it feels.
A brilliant product,” wrote one user.
And one more comment: “Funny advertising designed for moms who are breastfeeding (often they do it right at their workplaces or in the toilets), and who, indeed, feel a little “cows.”
This ad is not to praise or scold our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with these inconspicuous milk suckers hidden under the bras.
The concept behind this ad campaign is based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie milk pump is completely imperceptible, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in the bra for feeding, and at the same time imperceptible, giving women the opportunity to move, keep babies and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, comments: “Elvie’s milk pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves some bold and provocative publicity.
Drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring to the center of attention breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a humorous and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that gives a new breast pump.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Yakubovskaya, using this product for its intended purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children at guarantors.
Usually, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking a child on bail.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked for bail for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
About 80 percent of persons who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these individuals,” Albenz said.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of registration of children, officials have introduced new rules, according to which some of them must be brought to justice within a month after detention, and not 60 days, as it was earlier.
To assert their legal status as an immigration judge, many are present via video link rather than in person.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and information that has surfaced in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Advocates say these problems are increasing in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to emotionally prepare for it or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly."
“They should leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the crowd.
Moualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions driven from their homes since 2011, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Mualem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted the refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear timeline”, and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will be convened in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in this committee, saying that the commission’s work should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is probably what many liberal viewers hope.
And it will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers in the evenings during the main news show.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our comprehension,” says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama The Appointed Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in the attack.
Nell Scovell, long-published comedy writer and author of Only Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys Club, offers a different theory.
She recalls once riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Because it’s funny!” says Ms. Scowell.
There’s something valuable about all this chaos — it’s fun.
Of course, unlike all other content broadcast on television, storylines from Washington events can determine the future of “Roe vs. Wade” and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour in a row as a group of experts discusses Bob Woodward’s use of a “deep background” for his book “Fear”, or about Paul Manafort’s jacket for $ 15,000 from ostrich skin (clothes warmed by pride, as the Washington Post writes), or about Stormy Daniels’ sharp description of, let’s say, the anatomy of Mr. Trump.
I will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
“Part of his job is to make us feel like the reality show is feeding you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast of Trump’s show and the daily twists of the story.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flace this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the screen, at least not exactly when shown as Brett Kavanaugh appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee and decides the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flace says.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money pours into toughest midterm election run by White House
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is receiving cash flow thanks to a change in congressional districts in which two officials race for the same seat.
This suburban Pittsburgh neighborhood, whose geography was changed not so long ago, supports Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in an early election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which intersects substantially with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that as a result of pre-election fraud, old neighborhoods were in violation of the constitution attributed to Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated discussion about campaign funding between the main party's financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name came to prominence in Pennsylvania after winning a small margin in the March special congressional election in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. He also owned the property in Panama, until the partners evicted the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed punitive measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for that Central American country, with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, North and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference preparations to make progress and had effectively stopped considering punishing El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it as a sign that the administration attaches really important importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic representatives have safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or sanctions coming from Washington.
The White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on details of the debate, which were shared by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst who is part of the administration, but also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia and its attack in the past election.
If Congress succeeds, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and possibly eventually to fellow jurors.
But there are many “ifs”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor is the downfall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not, and thus missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are going through some of these tipping points now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president’s activities and talked about his unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times' data is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh isn’t complete or true, or if he’s still approved for the position of Chief Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson that I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house I lived in many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later accompanied me to light Saturday candles on the table with the symbol of the swastika.
With a family background like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of The Last Palace: A Disturbing Century of Europe in the History of Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrance of Rangers is optimistic ahead of a clash with the football club Viennese Rapid.
The Rangers host Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take a strong position in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season before a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing that we can get something, and left with a draw.
Maybe in the end we could handle it, but overall the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we performed better.
There will be another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one, given everything related to my injuries and the substitutions at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly selected, and the guys really enjoy it; training was held for a “hurrah”.
I hope we can move forward, put last season behind us and be successful.”
Women are losing sleep because of fear for their retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they had spoken to their children on the subject.
“People want to be cared for by someone in the family, but they’re not trying to talk to them about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance.
And you have to start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for what they will probably have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get health care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed cash life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insure with your own property, provided you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: save yourself from legal battles.
Make a power of attorney for medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended to consider the possibility of drawing up a financial power of attorney.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you find yourself incapacitated.
Do not forget about the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed emergency medical care, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper to prepare properly just in case.
Martin adds, “It’s not just the availability of finances that matters, it’s the choice of doctors.”
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, stomach and arm were hit by bullets, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 GMT, as an "accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the failure of communications, rescuers can not get any information from Donggal, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu as a result of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (as of 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district extending along 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, an administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has devastated Palu and Donggal several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidy Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervening in a domestic violence situation and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention facility and will be released on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he claimed to be “unambiguously innocent.”
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by up to one day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after she attributed her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident appear on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want to give a suspect in the terrorist attack in new York a rare death sentence
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight people and “deliberately” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a grand jury read out Saipov's conviction with 22 counts, which included eight charges of racketeering murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “carefully planned and deliberate,” Saipov carried it out in what is described as a “disgusting, cruel and criminal manner.”
"Saifullo Habibullahevich Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laur Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent reads.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since a New York Southern District prosecutor demanded the death penalty for a criminal offense.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse after his attack.
Police said he told investigators he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to all 22 counts in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov’s side, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that a decision to impose the death penalty, rather than a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously petitioned prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should not be held responsible for Brexit talks
Today, during a Tory protest, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army."
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would already “go out” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
However, the problem faced by Mrs. May, trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks, is aggravated by the fact that members of the Tory party opposed to leaving the EU join a separate protest against Brexit, which takes place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan, voiced in Chequers in the midst of attacks from Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the “chaos”.
Mr Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "beat the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be levelled and held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have gone out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will continue to advocate for Brexit, but we need to beat the Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue."
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving reporters the following comment: "I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people."
“Chekers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also unpopular with members of our party and our activists who actually storm the streets and first of all elect us.
Please put aside Checkers and start listening to what you’re being told.”
In a scathing address to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at their jobs if they stay true to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be forced to “feel the heat.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’”
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists brandished Tory anti-Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives over security issues on their party's mobile app.
“And these people claim to be able to set up Canada plus plus plus IT systems and technologies, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“A good Brexit doesn’t exist in principle,” he said.
Warren plans to “carefully explore” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully explore the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in November for re-election against Republican Party member Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There is talk that she has a chance to take the post of trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it was already her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to ‘fix’ our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuck), an LSU player was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which occurred on Friday, was arrested.
At 11 a.m., Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who managed to shoot on video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead outside the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death," Murphy police chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being involved in the incident, carrying a weapon and shooting Wade Sims.
At the time of his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, playing in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of world champion after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a big role in the race.
Already with the pole position, Bottas started well and practically hung on Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a pit stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the whole group - a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes left for a pit stop one lap later, and then left behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some "wheel-to-wheel" struggle, burst forward, which led to the Ferrari driver being reluctant to leave the inside space free, risking to hook up after double motion for protection on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap.
He then led most of the race by holding on to his native tyres, with the goal of quickly finishing, moving Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He ended up pitting on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day as Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in reserve," Hamilton said.
Traitorous Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were "vile, vile and deceitful people."
“The only possible response to all of this, and what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it’s anger, anger, abomination and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Did Diane Feinstein leak the information?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document? - "What, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Okay, stop.
We, or what, “leaked”? ... No, we did not “leather,” he added with the tone of the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges put forward by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I did not leak her information,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the leaking allegations did not seem to please the president, who commented on it during a Saturday rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you: her body language let her down great.
She may not have "leaked," but body language was the worst I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend his candidate for the position of supreme judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in every way possible.
We see meanness, abomination, they don’t care who they offend, through whom they have to step over to get power and control,” the president said.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In an Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 return match Saturday in Dundee's favor.
The Giants gained an early two-goal advantage thanks to kicks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bauviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer took the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee before two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For Adam Keefe's men, who won 2-1 over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat of the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides when the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFaul's goal pass with support from David Rutherford, after which Bovillier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt assisted Coney in levelling the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the initiative in the first break when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bouchard leveled the score again, scoring a goal at a numerical margin of 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory, keeping opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games so far, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid an earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he deliberately went to his death in order to ensure that the plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing as a result of a strong earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to destroy the area, many residents of the city of Palu were under the rubble of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the terribly swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, Palu city.
It remained in place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter could land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as access to the cities of Donggala, Shigi and Butong is restricted, according to the disaster management agency.
“The number of victims is probably growing, as a large number of people are still under the rubble, and many have not been able to get out of there,” says a representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, which on Sunday will host a mass burial of the dead.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Emergency ambulances bring casualties every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, saying in particular, "I ask all of you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which was on a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person is missing, while earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, it has no information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue the other passengers and the crew of the plane after it fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline also said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and they are all in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane began to enter the runway too low.
"And that's very good," Janes adds.
Janes said that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane, as the water level was at the waist.
He also said that flight attendants panicked and screamed on board, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the dock nearby also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they brought people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes involving PNG-registered companies over the past two decades, but none of these crashes had anything to do with Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst managed to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution opened a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone records to put together an overall picture of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained the whereabouts of these people from multiple mobile phones; according to these data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that evening, which contradicts his previous testimony, according to The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this became clear, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to the records of phone calls, they were called only for one week.
Rowlett also revealed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale says.
The defense is due to begin setting out its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be referred to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is “Conscious Hip Hop”?
The trio of hip-hoppers is going to fight against the negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that the content of hip-hop has changed, moving away from the original political and social problems.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make "conscious" hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny filed a lawsuit against a married couple because of racist SMS
A New York nanny sued a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be "another black", which the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The couple deny being racist, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “purpose of extortion.”
Lynsie Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern after learning that the new babysitter offered by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
“NOTHING, IT’S ONLY ONE BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly texted him twice to Miss Maurice.
Realizing her blunder, "confused" Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying on the service that the nanny, who turned out to be African-American, did not do her job well, and in general that they expected a Filipino woman, not an African-American woman, the New York Post reports.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for $350 a day in six months under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not secured by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “And I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple do not agree with the accusation of racism, and say that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, because, offending her, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joe Plasco, to the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude and didn’t want to?
Would you trust your newborn?
Come on!"
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and found herself in a “very difficult situation.”
“And you are ready to pursue a person who finds himself in such a position?
Not very nice of you,” added a bank worker specializing in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and logic problems.
Publishers Paddington feared that readers will not understand the move with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, commented about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading the work for the first time, even before it is published.
It’s very funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would have reacted to the refusal of publication with optimism, and also added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was "both joyful and bitter", since last year their author was gone.
As for Paddington, she refers to him as "a very important member of our family", and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
For Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of him, although he did not really consider this success his own merit.
I think he treated Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the product of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing the plane, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something had gone wrong,” says Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called again and said she was going to die within the next two minutes and that we needed to say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually ceased to act, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, coming to terms with the huge loss she had just had to endure.
“No one around knew what happened,” she says.
“My head sank, I didn’t stop crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-consuming feeling of sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have experienced the loss of loved ones, prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, the room lights up.”
However, before his death, he left his job, because he was going through really terrible times.”
It happened in 2014, and Tyler killed himself found his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m always afraid that there will be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards “so people know there’s someone to turn to and tell you everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t just sit there and talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she lived for 15 years - he died shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or upset or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he felt especially bad: he didn’t even look at the children when they opened their gifts.”
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it, this event shocked our family.
It tore her apart.
But we have to keep living and fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for — an investigation limited in time and scope — we could bring a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “rupturing” amid a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if — as expected — things go badly for Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and elect him to the post of supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of supreme judge.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, the South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung Seug, citing data from the Ministry of the South, said that compared with 2706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, last year this figure decreased to 1127 cases.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates levied by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to resume stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of hindering progress on this issue with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have even the slightest confidence in the United States, we also won’t have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Rea said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for chief justice, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately be called a ‘hysteric,’ ” Pelosi says of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, given to him on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly took place when they were both still teenagers.
Kavanaugh spoke quite emotionally, at times even broke down to scream and suffocated, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and well-planned assassination of a character” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, by his testimony, Kavanaugh only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with his claims, as well as the way he’s lashing out at the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not good for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s on right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Rowe v. Wade because he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing on his candidacy, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would reverse some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time to let a hysterical and prejudiced person into the position of supreme judge and at the same time exclaim: ‘How great!’” says Pelosi.
And women should own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, she can't go through it without tears.
“When we’re angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think.”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a managerial position. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique with which she explained to her interlocutor: “You may think that I cry because I am upset.
I’m actually angry.”
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in a man-dominated office was once crying with rage, but I was grabbed by a quiver by an elderly woman, a callous manager, whom I had always been terribly afraid of, and dragged to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out of anger.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you down.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic congressman, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some frivolous affair and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason preventing her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a grin 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was already coming to an end, it was far behind in fundraising, and so it vowed that it would not participate in the race unless it raised $2 million.
It seemed like a completely losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only offered her $250.
“What am I to them, a discounted commodity, or what?” she wondered.
When she delivered the speech announcing that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she suffocated.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking: what are they going to write on my monument?

How a trade war with America could be good for Beijing
Experts believe the first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has struck back each time, recently imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from five to 10 percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the United States will be equivalent every time, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to begin to experience at least the slightest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to back down is to yield to demands, but to publicly cede to the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, U.S. trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the two economies’ interdependence.
“The fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to an economic tailspin in any of these countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for New American Security, a think tank specializing in Asia.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept assistance on any terms or from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in a suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-range kick into the water on the 16th hole of par-3, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1st-4th player to ever go 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5:4 by the lowest-rated player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to get the cup again.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2: 1 in a single game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this win — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, losing only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, in vain trying to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to touch Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward, achieving success.
I love all 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to know how to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: the concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects an overall decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier reported abundant flowering, which indicates a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinella to southern Lee counties.
The fires can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to last week, their number has decreased significantly.
Red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and around Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota counties and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties still have the potential for airway irritation.
In northwestern Florida, no such possibility was reported last week.
