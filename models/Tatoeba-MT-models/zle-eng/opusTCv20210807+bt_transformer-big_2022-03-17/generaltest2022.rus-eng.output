From my point of view, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same women of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this color and with such a petal structure, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red, burgundy tones.
And the light roses look different, the petals have just satin or silky shine.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105х195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: the medium-rigid surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the “wave” or “hamak” effect.
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to allocate breathing materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The mattress also has an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and pollution is assigned to a removable case of jacquard, supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in a pair to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the parties - the coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

So no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests in the house of my parents.
Guests are on the doorstep, and on the stove more cutlets are toasted, the mother is knocked up by the floor.
Oh, my God, I'm so exhausted.
And then another dishwasher, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days of cooking, the day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are good, and the cake must be with them.
Since then, I don’t like the holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table to a minimum.
And I cook them delicious, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine is Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough to fully protect against the virus.
This is convinced by the head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall,” the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination.”
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer said.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other outings in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not only for throwing.
These vibes have a greater relative weight than those of similar counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when catching in the plume, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching pike and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive bait feeding is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two versions: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib game is able to irritate the passive pike, which does not react even to the live.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and woven cords even of large diameters.
For catching pike, pike, ruff or bass, in addition to uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "squatch" on the bottom.
If you catch in the tangled places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the baits of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively small and in rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” he said.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to seize” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya.”
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine countries in Africa - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to media reports, "Wagner" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not on the form lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the elections of deputies of the parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
“The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances that they will be held in time are rapidly decreasing,” the report said.
Against this background, the High Electoral Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see in the foreign policy of the country more success than failure, 29% believe that failures prevail.
“Examples of success — “in Syria defended, restored peace there”, “the decision on the “Nord stream-2”, “the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons”, “Crimea we pushed”.
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, the Public Opinion Foundation study says.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of paper record-keeping and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai’s life — we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the emirate’s crown prince and chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, said on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry indicators for 11 months were worse than last year’s result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Automobile Manufacturers Association of Turkey.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive trend to last year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, a Kazinform correspondent reports.
“According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, this year in pursuance of the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 “On approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses” was adopted,” Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy inquiry.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of loan payments provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The extension period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the subject of SMEs.
In the application of the borrower could be specified a different period of deferment of payments.
During the period of delay in relation to the borrower, claim and claim work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection by the creditor of commissions and other payments were suspended," the deputy prime minister said.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain of “ocmyron”
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "ocmyron" can be dangerous.
The reason is worth looking for in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ocmiron" originated in the body of an infected person with HIV or immunodeficiency.
That is, with a mutation, he did not meet any resistance to immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmyron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people die 30-year-olds, and 60-year-olds in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is rabid in the young, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with your finger, it hits like a gun on sparrows, "concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all the hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - it's temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia before the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Pavel Volchkov, Virologist, Head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at MIPT, noted that this category is very actively affected by the covid.
In adolescents who go to school, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as pupils of kindergartens, - Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT, told Moskva 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of a covid
The authors examined the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, while showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from the covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGAOU
N.I. Pirogov, head of the department of cognitive disorders of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt Returns Nearly 30,000 Illegally Exported Artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to their homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian government has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad said that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
The department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie’s on July 4 held an auction, at which a bust of more than 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally taken in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported monuments from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research of “black diggers”.
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of employees
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline before which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Credit Suisse does not officially comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly life of the poet and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary associations, he parted with imaginism, he is by himself, but he is known, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to wear it on their hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle “Persian motifs” was completed, the poem “Anna Snegina” was written, 8 books were published, the collection “Soviet Rus” was published.
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year Gosizdat concluded with Yesenin a contract for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets such honor was not awarded, he was the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, the engineer - 200).
The money was needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip the family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if a nightmare from the poem “Black Man” (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin’s death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where that pain came from.
Is the wind blowing?
Over an empty and uninhabited field,
Like a grove in September,
It drains the brain of alcohol.
Many friends noted that Yesenin strongly passed, looks bad, obviously sick.
Increasingly repeated twitches, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, there are no reliable documents.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan was recovering in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again Yesenin will get to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet’s drinking, scandals on this ground, and the reasons for the police are abundantly scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet’s terrible romance with the green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, the imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found on rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
The Elders remember:
“I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stairwell.
Falling, scratched his face and wheezing.
Having regained a bit of consciousness, he began to cough incessantly, spraying the whole sheet with blood.
Yesenin himself after a trip to Europe and the United States (in the States then there was a dry law, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything except the streets.
I'm at the end and people have stopped remembering...
And I drank, of course.
I drank because I was thirsty.”

Mattress Promtex-Oriental Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promtex-Oriental Duet Latex Economy is a modern version of the budget model in the premium class line.
The basis of the mattress is a block of independent Duet double springs.
A softer, smaller spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows you to evenly distribute the load on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is supplemented with a filler - artificial latex.
This is an analogue of natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress is perfect for a couple with a large difference in weight (from 30 kilograms).

All the energy is focused on choosing what he will earn his living.
He is much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who until the wedding periodically had problems with the law.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam, when she still did not fail him?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He will.

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon” against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons”
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenka”, but he “is actively looking for new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons “in many parts of the world.”
Earlier, the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a joke out of a man
The 2021 social events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film “No Time to Die,” he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional “bond” butterfly.
His example was twice followed by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that did not correspond to the royal dress code at the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend tried on myself and Lionel the Messiah.
The player came to pick up the seventh “Golden ball” in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model is Gucci, in which one of the premieres of the film “House of Gucci” is the ambassador of the brand Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of thread interweaving, a dense fabric is obtained with a vulvar outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but relevance.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event, - explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases when the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is indicated in the invitation.
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with income, - the authors of the Telegram channel about the men's fashion "Beauty Brammell". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in the velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at the corporate party, but if we are talking about "the head of those who are in charge of this event, then - yes, he has such a thing in the subject."
If the employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase “not according to Senka hat,” the editors of the Telegram channel say about men’s fashion.
Very mixed feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre that pulls you so hard.
And it is not associated with the pretty face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don’t understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid.
Billions of investments.
Are they in sorrow?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in circulation - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
It's dripping.
Then who's in the flyby?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.

Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots, “sleeping” energy crisis.

I haven’t seen a single beautiful person in the photo.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not sit down to them, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful people", but certainly not because of their appearance.

A slave who is not conscious of his slavery and who languishes in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose drools flow when he smugly describes the charms of a slave life and admires a good and good master is a hoop, a ham."
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months may protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, “a very long period.”
“Under the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four,” the expert said, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or vaccinated and sick, then he received “hybrid immunity”, that is, there are many antibodies and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of ‘massive consequences’ in case of invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the Group of Seven (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly,” but the document does not describe specific measures.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” the statement said.
Further, the ministers urge Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine’s restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed the "unanimous voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against micron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We can see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety,” said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the effect of omicron-strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the defense Ministry of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons to NATO in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine Alexey Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to destroy drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin the supply of weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “occupation” of part of Ukrainian territory by Russia.
The same “illogical” position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will retain under the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine expect that Germany “will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense”, the President added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when banking card data falls into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
“Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the funds to the client, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received in various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU law
German Chancellor-elect Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine’s borders and the situation with Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the controversy.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitments to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine’s border, a position confirmed on Sunday by G7 officials.
Dmitry, look carefully.

You wash them once a year at Easter, so you have to wash them.
Just don't let it get dirty.

Who found money in the wall of the church plumbing will pay 20 thousand dollars
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay the award.
This was reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church Lakewood, where preaches pastor Joel Austin, promising that devout Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages with money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to the theft that occurred in Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then disappeared about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks that were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated $ 5,000 for the award and later received another $ 20,000 as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her description of "as a real person."
That’s why her attitude is so negative.
And it’s not that “she is financially much richer than all the writers”, as they say here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves so brazenly, so provocatively, like this madam.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to demand a covid passport from entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
It is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from the presentation of the certificate.
Also in the list of exceptions are persons who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow,” said Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Revealed scheme of full protection against COVID-19
Virologist, doctor of medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved through the introduction of injection and the use of nasal vaccine.
With internal use, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. With the introduction of the vaccine, this does not happen with injections.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside after vaccination, we most of all form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no solution for double vaccination yet,” he said.
The chief prophylactic UrFO, doctor of medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help those that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseynov said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the male (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, a corm, affection, love and games for a flowing bitch, then go ahead.
But Pessel was trained and generally smart.
I chose my company and went home.
The video is a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down a lot of owners not to run after the dog, although they lamented that out, 200 thousand run away (poms), directly took her hand and took her to the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog who ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccinations do not stop
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make vaccination against the covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading “This is a false pandemic,” “I won’t get vaccinated.”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of several regions of the country took against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of protesters threw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she began to study earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
Here is just one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans suffered only death and looting of any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus “omicron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of a new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively distributed since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, can bypass the degree of spread of the delta strain, it is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in the UK.
Experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “omicron” in the coming months will displace the “delta”.
And the number of cases in the UK alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" is currently sick in the Kingdom several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain of “omicron”, and at the peak of the hospital will take more than 2 thousand people daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain of "omicron" is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
About how to react to the "omicron" of the Russian "Satellite V" is still unknown - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omichron strain.

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, communicate easily and at ease, and when meeting in person and have nothing to say.

Again, the Soviet time is called the “time of demons”.
At that time, people believed in God more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up practically according to God’s laws (love for one’s neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What ideology today is money at any cost.
Globs of faith is not enough (yes, it does not exist), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s.
Our St. Petersburg, or rather, the Leningrad communal with Bolshoy Zelenina, maintains communication until now.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of relations between the older generation.

The most popular in the world were various video services.
Most users downloaded CapCut video editor, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significantly, user spending in applications increased: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to physical" growth of the application economy slow down? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
India became the leader in the number of downloads of applications: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).

The top 10 by number of downloads also includes Telegram.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two of them in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to the creation and broadcasting of video (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are included in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo).
“The most users spent in applications for live broadcasts and online streaming,” the authors of the report note.

All over the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to life in mobile, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries were those that helped people to be closer, both virtually and personally,” said Lexi Sidow, head of marketing research at App Annie.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hypercasual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and video design is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world include Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY are among the leading games.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of next year, the company’s analysts called the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth of popularity among the Z generation of financial applications, for example, Robinhood investor applications, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

Russians warned about the new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by “Izvestia” with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of the company Ivideon Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communication tools are dipfake.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real records with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfake, attackers can call friends of the victim via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution for blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I would add.
In what I wrote above, I put an emphasis on the fact that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow me to paint hard and walk in short skirts, show stockings and tights on my legs.
It's a province, but there's such a thing in the store.
In large cities and Muslim women were painted, and the beds were shown.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but the same cosmetics are not.
Listed five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excessive amounts.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by malnutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increase the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the “migraine of the day off” at workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being at the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of health after working weekdays is often the “weekend migraine”, said a famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of System Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics, who have a headache, weakness and weakness on the weekend, are especially often affected by this.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
Our lives change radically over the weekend.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, most likely eat more, and drink less, - the doctor argued. - Due to lack of coffee, a small break begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness. "
A late rise plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then a reaction will occur, which is called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to follow what changes the most during the weekend.

South African scientists have announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
In South Africa announced the low effectiveness of the vaccine Pfizer against “micron”
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against omicron-strain coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of "micron") corresponds to the (level) of effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the product may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor’s sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to decarbonise its economy.
According to him, Germany by 2045 plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
“In 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which they recorded Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the Minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline “does not meet the requirements” of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers have hacked the Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi’s office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter quickly reacted - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister’s page was hacked in 2020 and urged to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, a majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted “against”.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt,” as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and “honest” election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonian independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” Eric Zemmour repeatedly repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians was the choice of France."
Lights, oh, hello!
I'm a little... a little sassy, still embarrassing, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning your back on my channel.

WSJ readers criticized the article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “stand united against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," a comment from one of the readers leads RIA Novosti.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of North Kurilsk.
It lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce a new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported on December 11 by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: hull and the like,” he said.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it “in all respects”.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of military operations of the combined forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward.”
At the airport escaped from the container two lions
Lions escaped at Singapore’s Changi airport.
It is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, arrived on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the escaped lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed next to him.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with the help of darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine institution.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion escaped from the owner and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, the people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Beth Kitchin, a nutritionist at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid milk flakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75 thousand people may die from omicron strain by April
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England can die up to 75 thousand people, if not to tighten the restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omichron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
“Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from overburdening if the micron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot rule out infection,” said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency reported that if the rate of spread of omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omichron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, there are 1,898 cases of coronavirus infection in the UK, of which 633 have been identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid indicated that in reality this figure can already reach 10 thousand cases.

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world registry of ships, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn’t been such a rush in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to escape from a pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted on the buzz.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of traveling in space, life on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with this kind of money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have stern lengths above 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
On the yacht there is a "lunar pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas have become common, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of the wrestler McGregor, a platform for martial arts.
But it has a symbolic meaning when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet’s biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail rested on his Eclipse yacht with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners are not sympathetic to other people when they, as Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels 50 meters deep.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This writes the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists can not determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how animals develop intelligence.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study shows that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or write poetry, do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “trade” over Ukraine’s entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to “join anywhere”.
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send an offeror.
And in relation to Ukraine, a bargain is planned,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are conducted secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and not wait for the group to be detected and deployed by the counter-forces," he said.
China stimulates development of railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said a representative of the company Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and performance of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed”.
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. launched the first two-storey high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on a subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city’s airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s rail equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoxian, head of the trade and investment department of China’s International Trade Promotion Committee (ITCCC).
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market,” said Feng Yaoxian.
After more than 60 years of hard work and a series of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of auxiliary equipment and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxian, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist Lists Early Signs of Dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semyon Golosheikin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
Signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, reducing the level of abstract thinking, he said.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheykin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic,” said Goloseikin.
Earlier, the charity organization for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a state when a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical consultation set up under the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character,” the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, which we have not found an opportunity for in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to its former rights.

In Spain, there were protests against COVID-passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia held a protest against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the Agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their poster, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a medical ward from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and airplanes.

The steep rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will collect 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taivu in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, that is still a long way off.
Games organiser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every winter more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now no one suffers from unemployment.
More and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes open catering points with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become the leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said the WHO
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress on universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and the World Health Organization published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The WHO and the World Bank said the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Previous Post:The Taiwanese Minister was disconnected from the broadcast on the “Summit for democracy” at the request of the White house
Taiwan’s Digital Minister Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Summit for Democracy” was moved to no-video mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was allocated a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map, which was shown by Ms. Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was designated green as “free” and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her part was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the US government.”
The PRC was not invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map, which was demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the policy of “one China”, which Washington adheres to.
One of the sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
Organized by Washington “Summit for democracy” was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

No need to one bunch - bad people are, you may have a claim to them on a specific occasion ...
But what about the number of children, age, pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "scumbags, did not return the money."
But how many and when they have children, it is not your business until they are going to hang these children around your neck.
And if that's not possible, what right do you have to condemn them?
Maybe it's only in education so...
The chosen ones (by themselves) dictate their rules, frankly spitting on the already existing ones.
And what if this applies to other areas of life, court proceedings, etc.?
Laws are not written for them.
What if Dad does implement his parenting and education methods?
It’s a bad example for others.

The foreign Ministry said about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with “Izvestia” estimated the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after the long journey that we have gone through with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the dangers of vaccination with the nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the RAS, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that a person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary,” said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience is gained in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that when using nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person with nasal congestion faints after injection.

The total number of cases of COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK reached 3137 people.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” into the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov says that “everyone in the world understands this.”
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in respect of Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is confident that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of the participants refused to withdraw from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were canceled.
The voting rate on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its own territory.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration that allows the region to organize a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO says ‘omicron’ is less dangerous than ‘delta’
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminary believes that “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the case of a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, “Omicron” is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the omichron strain protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and variant transmission.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it (“heaviness of the disease” - ed.) may be less severe than in the “delta””, - stated in the technical message of the WHO.
The organization notes that so far, all reported cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are easily or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the “delta”.
In Russia, two cases of infection with omicron-strain have been registered.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and, possibly, will make compromises on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal “Glavred”.
The first option, which Denisenko called a “perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with key FPG (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.),” the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of dissenting groups with Zelensky and the President, which is likely to seize control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting power,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can lead to an event that will be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-MP believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the survey data of the sociological group “Rating” showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest rate since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine for Zelensky would vote only 21.8%, while for the former President of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from bachchi and not before the beginning of August.

Arrested for the action on Red Square poet: "For the quote Yevtushenko 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster that featured the hashtag ?poetrussiabiggerpoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drawn up a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the order of public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and there is also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time, employees were more correct, detention as much as possible, polite, no matter how funny it sounded in some context of the word.
On Pushkin took OMON and took hard.
I asked him about his motivations.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all four sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after the action under this hashtag they begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless uses the help of an interpreter.
And even at official events, a transcript is kept in the old-fashioned pen, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.
You don't want a lot of words, so say no!

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body’s systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of gingivals, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or cook the root vegetable, rather than fry it in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.

According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issue of “Yandex”
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites of the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, director general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service ivi in Russia (part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of TNT (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.

In fact, the slogan "The edge is not Russia" appeared in 1848.

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160х190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces that are different in softness - high rigidity and slightly more than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage".
This means that the sleeping space has 2000 spirals, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropackage" is the highest frequency of the whole variety of spring blocks "Dimax", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: top and bottom of the springs are installed combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long held the status of a classic, since it conveys not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the correct support for the back, then the latex gives the adaptation of the surface under the human body.
Case: The model comes in an Aloe Vera knitted cover.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: 3 years warranty period.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam, which is used in the mattress, has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability for life of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but probably Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Paiusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metauniverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend of creating remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to the digital format.
Ana, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we will have a traditional Olivier and a herring under the fur coat, but no one forces me to eat everything at once.
You can eat on a spoon, try - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off, you can cook any tasty and healthy dishes.

And she also understands that 4 years before the next Olympics, she will not survive, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who hasn’t done just sports or can’t imagine all the circles of hell she’s gone through, DO NOT LEAVE WITH THE DAMNMENT.
British economist failed to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the rise in commodity prices was temporary or not.
Even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of endless central bank generosity has already outlived its usefulness” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates will correlate with expected GDP growth.
O’Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O’Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department “Opening Investments” Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar Shulgin called the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, only sluggish.
There is also a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The relative Kia brand Hyundai increase is even more significant - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions of this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai, it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger rise in price.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands grew not so much: according to the statistics of the committee of automakers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good growth in sales and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - and hence a greater increase in financial capacity,” explained the general director of NAPI Tatiana Arabaji.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic figures, which also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
According to the dynamics of income growth, the Russian Lada shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and all in the red - for 10 months, the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production, covering the entire world automotive industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the automotive market of Russia in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recoup past losses, experts say.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put in the price of cars before.
says the analyst of "VTB Capital" on the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining a high margin of sales. ”
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars grow faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With increasing supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income from volumes, says independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are striving to get the most profit from each sold car, notes Bourgazliev.
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the hype is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion by Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a “invasion” by Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
“There have never been such plans,” the head of the White House said, answering a journalist’s question about whether the United States abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will move forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the Eastern flank, B9 — all those NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory.”
I immediately leave these interviews.
If already in the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burqa and another cup of washing - it is terrible to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an eyeliner layer, where you immediately talk to the leader.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an “employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” or another power structure, then it is ineffective to immediately drop it, and it is likely to be impossible to blacklist it.
Because to confirm his lies about involvement in law enforcement, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
We need better advice for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe that was the case.
They don’t know who to blame anymore.
We reached the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except the most...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the election, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections...

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, out of the question.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
