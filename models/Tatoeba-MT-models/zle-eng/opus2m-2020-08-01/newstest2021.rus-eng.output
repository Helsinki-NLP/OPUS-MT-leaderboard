Semilarski v. Prosecutor ' s Office: Cassation of former Vice Mayor Tarto will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to take proceedings against Semilarski, but in April his appeal was appealed to the State Court of Justice.
On 12 December 2019, the Tarto Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, since its authorization was outside the competence of the Administrative Court.
The Court ' s ruling stated that the complaint required compensation for damages sustained in criminal proceedings.
“The Public Prosecutor's Office and the county court should regulate such matters”, earlier explained to the correspondent, ERR, the Spokesperson of the Courts of Tartus, Annette Creitsmann.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the decision to the District Court, which did not alter the decision of the court of first instance on 5 February.
Now I have to say my word to the State.
According to counsel Semilarski, a jury lawyer for Oliver Nenes, his client had been wrongly suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office refute the wrong allegations and compensate him for the moral damage he has suffered.
The case of the Special Prosecutor of the Liuna District Prosecutor ' s Office, Margus Gross, made in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another Vice-General Tarta Artem Sovorov, was arrested on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“We recall that when I was detained, the Security and Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that Tarta's leaders, one of the most influential bodies of local self-government, were corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the Public Prosecutor's Office does not want to say anything about it," commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nenes, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor ' s Office should operate at a press conference.
"The statement of bribes and corruption has proved to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania that, during the investigation phase, representatives of the State should be careful to choose words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals prior to sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not respected in this case against Walvo Semilarski,” Nez said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still clarified are inadmissible, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair treatment of the complainant”, added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Vice-President Tarto Valvo Semilarski would not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal proceedings against him in July had been partially closed.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of a deliberate violation of anti-corruption law in transactions of a particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, former Deputy Mayor Tarto participated more than thirty times in town management meetings in the decision-making process involving companies operating in Tarta whose owners or leaders Semilarski were actively associated at the personal level during the overtime period.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests and was therefore required to be suspended from taking part in decision-making.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had accused Semilarski of receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation in transactions of a particularly large size.
This occurred in October 2016 when he was arrested along with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Sovorov (Centre Party).
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police then stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice-Presidents.
After that, both officers resigned.
The Savrov case was later brought to trial, which fully justified politics.
The trial in the Walvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

How the economy will be affected by the decision of the CB to lower the key rate
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It has gone down by another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25 per cent of the annual figure, to a formal level of another historical minimum.
The regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before, based on the return of a brief reduction in interest rates, as well as the tone of CB statements and updated Russian economic forecasts.
This means that the current cycle of mitigation of monetary policy can soon stop.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that there are still risks of inflation down from 4 per cent in 2021”, reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabillin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabilina, will take over one and a half years.
In doing so, she noted that following the removal of the pandemic, economic processes had intensified: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand had been restored, consumer construction and production had increased, and annual reductions in transport traffic and production had slowed.
According to an updated forecast, in 2020 the economy will decrease by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (4 to 6 per cent) and the economic recovery by 2021 will grow by 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, in 2022 by 2.5 to 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil price forecast to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The CB used to expect $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the forecast of the Russian Bank for Inflation for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, compared with the earlier expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the cycle of mitigation, and considers the economists of Russia and the CIS as the Renaissance Capital of Sofia Dontz and Andrei Melaschenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen to 3.5 percentage points.
At the previous meeting, in June, the CB reduced it to one percentage point at a time due to low inflation due to the reduced demand and the need to stimulate the halting economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
Qualifying monetary policy is maintained (at the next meeting, on 18 September, before the end of the year), but the limit is near, and the main analyst, Rosbank Evgenius Koschelev, agrees.
The aggregate risk of inflation also indicates the proximity of a pause in mitigating interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures and faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
In order to complete the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia, greater attention will be required to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external fervor, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
In any event, the reduction of the key rate would further reduce the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps mortgages, says the senior economist at the Discovery Bank's Analysis Office, Maxim Petrnović.
The rate adjustment would be less expressed than the reduction in the key rate, he clarified.
Consumer rates may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, and mortgage rates may end at 6.2-7 per cent, without excluding BCF premier Anton Pactovic.
In his view, the average contribution rates would also fall - they could drop to 4.2 to 4.5 per cent in the coming months (at present barely above 4.5 per cent).

Survey: The ruling Union of peasants and Green Lithuania once again led the party ratings
The Union of peasants and Green Lithuania, which leads the ruling Seimas coalition, led the party ratings.
This was demonstrated by a survey conducted by Villmorus, a sociological research company, at the time of ordering the newspaper Letuvos ritas.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the peasants lost their first place and for a long time led the main criticisms of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition union of the Fathers - Christian Democratics (Conservatives).
However, recently President Gitas Nausd of Lithuania, after assessing the electoral capacity of the parties, stated that the Union of peasants and Greens, following this year's parliamentary elections, was likely to be able to form a coalition again.
This statement has caused conservators to resent.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for conservatives.
According to Director Villmorus Vladas Haydis, the gap is within error, and yet the rulings are no longer behind the conservators.
According to Hadis, the sociological success of the peasants has been facilitated by news that their electoral list will be chaired by Prime Minister Saulus Svernis.
This politician was the first on the list of peasants and in the 2016 elections.
In third place, the Social Democratic Party is now ready to vote 7.1 per cent of the respondents.
She suddenly lost 2% for last month.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin, Victor Ospasski (6.2 per cent).
The remaining political organizations, according to the survey, will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

The Podmoskovia authorities reported on the fate of closed dumps
In Podmoskovia, solid waste sites continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfill sites are being upgraded to modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for each site; many of them have grown into dense housing.
Once the test site is closed, it stands up for reclamation - the body of the test site is packed with soil, gas-freeing systems are being installed and infested.
This allows chemical processes to stop within the landfill, so that it does not become flammable, fertilized, poisoned soil and groundwater.
And then the former dumpster will be raised up by a useless pile in the midst of its built-in dwellings.
Why don't you do something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruz, where the re-establishment of the Annino site literally ended in the days, the authorities are considering the possibility of making a pile of mining slopes out of a pile.
The site, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, expanded to include land allocated to it.
Therefore, the re-entry had to purchase neighboring areas that had long since been buried under the cover of debris.
"For a while, the platform's going to go up," and we're going to think about what we can do to get it started.
"It's a ski resort," told the reporters about the head of the Russian district of Nicolai Parthenov.
Two sites will become renewable energy extraction sites
Torbeevo polygons in Lubertsa and Temochho in the Bogos district will become renewables from landfill and biological gases.
Torbeyev will launch a gas power plant at the end of the year, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacaloria of thermal energy, which will provide for its own needs - heating of administrative and production facilities.
Temhohoho will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
A museum may be established at the Kuchino Balashhin site, which was closed after complaints by the residents on the Line of the Line with the President of the country.
“It was this idea to create a museum for the re-establishment of Podmoskovia sites”, said the government’s deputy minister for environment and environmental management in the region of Dmitry Kurakin.

The beautiful high minerals only adorned Aya-Sofia
Once again about Aya Sofia, the text of the Zelinsky Lord came into play, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's house is a free entrance rather than a paid entrance.
Secondly, Muslims were just as honest in their conquests of this land as the Orthodoxs conquered the Volgo-Okreque, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God's help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
We're gonna get everyone back?
Do you think there are no pagans who will need to return their hood, whose place is the Tenth Church?
Thirdly, Muslims have improved the building and invested in it.
I mean, it's just like factories and places that the Lenins took from the burgers their property, and they belong to the Lenins -- Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything, from Kremlin to Angar, so they're all right-wing progressers.
The beautiful high minerals have really adorned Aya-Sofia, very.
There was a stupid nun, a stupid nun with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” or “orthodox” civilizations.
And there are believers, and there are hypocrites.
He who believes in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
It's the thinking of a British official, Meda Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
And to him who believeth every place of prayer.
And always.
He who disbelieves does not pray except where he is asked to leave; he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're blouses, not eel movies.

"-Yes!"
I bought it, I liked it, I didn't have a fresh gardener, and then I looked at that yes on every corner, lied to my grandmother, I took it from someone, and I told them about my experience with Tatiana Kraselnik.
At the same time, users emphasize that they do not call on them not to buy from their grandmothers but merely share their opinions and suggest that they pay attention to the quality of their products.

The decision to expand the CPF would not have been supported by WEFA or FIFA
Alexander Dukov, President of the Russian Union for football (RFF), believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Prime League (PPF) to 18 teams at the present time.
"First, it was a decision of the RPF, but I agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament has been completed.
This violates the integrity of the tournament and the principle of sport.
And certainly this decision would not have been supported either by FIFA or by FIFA," Dyukov stated after the Russian Cup's final “Zenit” — “Himki” (1:0).

I knew that Briant's self-interest could not be done with any kind of a touch to keep him out of sport.
Coby had a killer instinct, so at the site, I tried to talk him out so he wouldn't take a game of aggression.
At the site, I gave him a compliment, "Oh!
Cobie, you're good, you're a good passerby!
When he heard my excited response, he almost forgot that he had to put a ball in his hands and get another three or four points.
We had a good relationship with Coby," says Kirilenko's words "The Nightly Moscow."
He also described his first game against Jordan.
"I've besieged him.
For the first three minutes of the game, I was completely fascinated by the legend I saw on TV.
While I was happy to breathe, Michael had a lot of points.
Soon I walked away from the trade, and a couple of times I covered his eyebrows...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," added the head of the FFB.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.

Russian serial actor replied to allegations of “LGBT propaganda and feminism”
The Russian recorder Chiki, who was accused of “LGBT and feminism propaganda”, responded to the film's claims.
"The authors understood the severity of the themes raised and did not want to insult anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in a conversation with the publication Pod.
"I think it's a story of power and common aspects of human life.
This is nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the boy's father, who changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he was proud of his work and did not view it as propaganda.

But we were open, so the people who first came with the claims started to help us," he summed up.
