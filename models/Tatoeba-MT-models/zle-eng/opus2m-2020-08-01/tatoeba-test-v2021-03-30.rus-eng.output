We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?

I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You just run away from life's problems.
Cut the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.

Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe it?
We slept under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Wasn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20th?

Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it begin?
Clamming is one of five senses.
What do you got?

Every morning I go shopping.
The baby's pushing.

Do your parents know about this?
The waitress put a white table on the table.
I stayed home that day because it rained.
Is there a pharmacist nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.

Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.

We have heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very upset.

We won't let that happen.
These fools broke the law prohibiting the breaking of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loudly that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his sight.
I didn't give it to Tom.
It's weird rumors.

I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more to buy wine?
I'm not gonna mess with you.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom everything that's happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
Am I the only one who thinks that?
Everyone except Tom has hats.
She gives him anything he asks.
Is this for sale?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have more?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only makes the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a washing can in the toilet.
I called at the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I have your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get into other people's business.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
The carrots are good for your eyes.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom shaved.
It's half a third.
The left is strong.
I needed to make sure he came here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy corrected the hat.
Why don't we go for a walk?

I don't like this store.
Tom speaks French terribly.
I don't remember how much I paid for it anymore.
You don't eat with us?

I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house's outside the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you all right now?
I fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 pushers.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom a sling, threw a glass of wine through it, and took a firm step out of the restaurant, a dead silence reigned.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's father, who's in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't received any news from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom could swim.
I thought it was time for all of us to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of himself.
Please just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what's called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through the senses.
How many airline carriers are there in the U.S. Army?
Is she your teacher?
Sleep again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots of winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everybody looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you awake?
Get the trash out.

Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy candles?

Where are the rest of the prisoners?
Today, so many things have happened.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired to death.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept knocking her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.

I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
You signed the contract?

Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
The area has changed completely.
Tom's an anti-Semitism.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like being pushed.
I wonder, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song to Necklaev, could she have imagined that he would run for president?

You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut butter.
You're lucky.
Tom's starting to get a little drunk.
I barely understood it.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still feel no comfort.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a word?
Don't make a noise like that.
When did Tom get arrested?
We're eating at six.
The deer was the victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.

How can you always be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What a thing!
So you bought it?

I like walking along the river.
You can come with me.

Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom sat on his bike and got it.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I waited for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes into his mind.
Why do you want to leave?
How's French "bye"?
It wasn't worth so much.
What's with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?

That's when I damaged my gymnasium.
There's nothing more to tell me about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She sat on her chair and read the magazine.
It is prohibited to cry from this moment on.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
Here's the house he lived in.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Eat my chocolate?
In white, the house seems bigger.
I found it difficult to find an original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing that?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom's going back to Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I was watching a French movie with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was good at it.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play banjo?
Tom came up to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you come back?" "It depends on the weather."
How Many Tortoises Do They Live?

We'll see if we can do this.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom will probably win.
What would you like to bring to you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your adventure seeker's spirit?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.

It's hard to be a woman, you have to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in a hat.
Put it on the regiment.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always an enormous number of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
To pretend to make me believe that I believe in something you don't believe in!
I think it would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I've been pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
Do you think that's possible?
He's sick of everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If it's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.

I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit down with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything other than the Bible?
Read me the evidence from the cat.

The law is on my side.
So we had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was scheduled for Professor's birthday.
Your phone rang several times while you were in the shower.
She married him for money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
The bill, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You have a birthday soon.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded online.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Clearly, he is the best person to do this work.
You're making it easier for me.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't seem like you're too busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know those men out there?
Tom left the room without telling anyone a word.
That probably didn't happen.
Are you done lunch?
Tom and Mary talked at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.

Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I won't be late any more.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live close enough to you.
Tom takes care of the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They cut Tom off his life support machine.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom is twice as young as you.
Tom locked the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat, which can be derived from radioactive wastes.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say Tom first?

The 12-hour journey was exhausting.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom had breakfast.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help him wash the windows?
It's beyond my competence.
That was yesterday.
I'm beginning to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm out of here.
Don't tell me what actually happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these cards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I gave up the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that dictionary.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I didn't have time today to do that.
Mary said she'd help him.
The multiple number from "person" is "people", not "persons".
That's two steps.

I think that's why I should have stayed in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me what the baby's name was.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope you're well paid.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.

I'm probably late.
Do your children know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup is giving fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to buy time.
I already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in terms of the terrible Jewish dialect of the Aramese language instead of Hebrew, thus proving the failure of claims that there was a sacred language whose use in prayer was particularly close to God.
Finally, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.
The weather forecast was not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to cook something for you.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read that book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of the young man I am.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing the piano a little bit.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came into her mind at the last moment.
There's a very rough air in this room.

And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is this my book?
Stirch is routine work.
Who else on your list?
Don't give him my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's children must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics at Oxford.
He was hiding this fact from me.
Did you save me?
He was sobbing in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by the voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do it.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said the days would come, like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?

We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's doing his best.
Why won't you be here tomorrow?
We need to get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't figure it out.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get himself to the hospital.
I sat next to Tom.
You have a upset voice.
You've always been so selfish?
I think you'll benefit from this medicine.
Tell Too to be here by half a third.
It's not God's news, it's science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
You want a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the threshold of a hungry death.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I think I'm going to do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.

Come to me.

I finally got to work.
Tom's in the kitchen, washing the dishes.
The temperature dropped by three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was crowded.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
That car's a good seller.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words confused me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom should have done.
Say hi to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response shook everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I have to go now.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is violent.
I'm dreaming a little bit.
That's why there's no one but himself.
I'm from Sydzooka.
Tom slept in his backyard all the trees.
Saturday is the day he is free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in thirty minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
Eating is understandable.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.
What are you doing right now?
Postalon's cute.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't have listened to my advice.
You want to say something to Tom?
You don't want another son?
How can I lose weight?
I think we should tell him we're late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They were trying to hide their anxiety.

I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the sweater.
Tom shot and killed the tiger.
I've never met anyone above me.

I had to tell them myself.
The audience was laughing.
You're not paying attention to me.
I have a broken ankle.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He's a knight without fear.
They hate women.
I don't have much stuff with me.
Tom tried to run away.
What color does her eye have?
Go quickly!
You overestimate him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around me.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaii is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was here first?

Prices will go down.
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom screams at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom was kind of saying that Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
Over and over again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog swearing in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know it won't happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You just run away from trouble.
A yard without women as a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with it.
I put on a bait hook.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind's over.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.
Tom learns as properly as other boys in their class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to cook food for soldiers.
What happens if we get caught?
I can put things in the box.
I'm gonna clean up your bedroom tonight.
He has five languages.
Tom had a difficult childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like how you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
The kids in this class aren't as tall as Bill.
Should we go?
I knew you could rely on me!
Tom added firewood.
"Love never killed anyone." "Did you ask Romeo and Juliet?"
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary have ever been to Boston.
Are you ever a solo?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school now, isn't he?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try and prove me wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Does it hurt anywhere?
He couldn't go because of the lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why you can trust me.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple rot.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom’s favorite city.
Too bad someone's dying.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think this might interest us?
I'll think about you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
Thinking she was going alone, worried me.
The river's the size of the river.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He's sure to come.
Do you have a message?
Tom called me suddenly last night.
We really need it.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the beakers.
I've decided to give up.
An accident took their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you bring a towel?
Tell Him I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom got on the bus going to Boston.
Falling down, she hit her elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?
They're calling you.
I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another child.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston by car.
The weather forecast cannot be trusted at all.
She's still young.
Did you follow Tom's advice?
Tom said he was a fartist.
How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You won't need it anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom could not read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than I am don't care.
Is this your first visit to Australia?
These are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser led with a eyebrow on all three of their nets.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
A kilogram of figs costs two and a half euros.

What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have an assignment for Tom.
"How was the accident?" "No one knows."
What do you like about him?
When I came to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one objected.
She's running.
It's a man.
If I was Icelandic in color, I think he'd be white.
Do you know where the meeting will be?
I wish they were happy.
I want to say no to my job.
Christians have many followers.
The rugs absorb the sound.
Tom told me it was impossible.
That must be where Tom lives.
Tom is a strange child.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work hard.
I love Arabic.
I hope you're wrong about this.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's on duty.
I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got lots of talents.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He goes to school late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
You speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
That song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We need to be prepared.
What was his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom abandoned Mary's keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God prefigured the reconciliation in Jesus Christ of royal authority and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went to our home.
It's thin, but it's strong, and it doesn't break.
It's all a little stupid.
At the moment, I don't know what I want.
It's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five for TV!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really so bad?
Tell me, please, where you'll live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't nice.
Are you crying a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, let's walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everyone's doing it.
I often visit relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You must be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God’s help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is imperceptible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same height.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Maria's youngest brother.
You act like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
The book's big.
Don't say that about Tom.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought some cookies.
Next year Tom will teach French.
I've been listening to her for the rest of my life.
I told Tom to rest.
Why are you mad?
The worst part of the trip is already behind us.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
This knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
You'll only have a minute.
I would really like to change this situation.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never survived.
You want to come with us?
Tom knows how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
"Shut up your fucking music and read your book." "I see my censorship spell is still working!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've been discussing this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same as you.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join me.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for her forgiveness again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never there.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they take you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary sewed Alice's new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat harms your health and your environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yes, did you tell him?" "No, he knew it."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought of something.
Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is crying yves.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my skin.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.
The river oversowed the garden.
A strong wind quiet at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom carried two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to lying down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I ever ate.
I had parking problems.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
You know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom never was late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it begin?
No one cares about what she thinks.
This doesn't seem strange to me at all.
"Where did you get my phone from?" "Tom gave it."
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he was trying to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find it, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom had a divorce with Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
The lesson is endless!
That box weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's a cop.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
It's unlikely to happen.
I'll do it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been free all day, and I work today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why would Tom get angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's gonna put some hard paper on it.
Don't be angry with him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.
Pradd Tom was born blind.
Tom's above you, isn't he?
She hurt her back by playing tennis.
Tom's scared easily.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm coming with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
During the summer, they traveled to the mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What are you waiting for Tom to do?
She seemed quite calm.
Press the button.
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary was wearing boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she was cold.
The traffic inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do that tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's terribly bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was first.
Everything's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Take a tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long arms.
Tom was in his sandwiches.
There's a bench underneath the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How do you like my story?
Tom turned off the alarm clock and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan on going.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I'm not changing my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for helping me.
Tom could have told me.
This will bring misery to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary was trying to sell her house.
You need to stay awake.
My mother is very helpful to me.
Tom's got a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by a mistake.
What's that dog's name?
Go for the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy any happiness.
Tom grew up in a children's home.
I don't want to watch this video.
The poorest EU country is poorer than the poorest U.S. state?
Say hello to Tom from me.
I want to thank you for what you did for Tom.
I bumped into my friend.

Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your trip.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe it.
We've seen lots of unusual plants in the Botanical Garden.
Sometimes a small gift can be an expression of great love.
You prefer blonde or brunette?
I didn't get on the bus.
That's why I didn't like this movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Fire.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
French isn't that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was a seat.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not gonna marry her.
Tom drinks apple juice.
You're going on a train?
That's what we think.
How could something like this happen?
You're an actress.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and legs are always suffocating.
How do I translate words that are not available in any language other than mine?
Can you tie this tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom's really mad at me.
I used to wash my head just once a week.
Eleven are a simple number.
I won't lie to you.
Coffee on my account.
We're husband and wife.
Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
The leaves begin to fall in October.
Melanie said she likes to swim.
What's bothering you?
I'm too busy talking to you now.
The captain controls his ship and his team.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where the hell are you doing this?
A third of the prisoners ran away.
Praise be to Allah!
You think Tom knows?
This time, I'm crying.
Tom acted like a child.
Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it immediately.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid there's something I need to admit.
It was expected that Tom would be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"You speak Greek?" "No, it's my first lesson!"
Why did you give him money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you get her?
I've been to Sapproe before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late for a plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the deepest part of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When do we have a woman president?
He came in hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's cookie I'm hot for you.
England is like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
That dog won't scare a child either.
Don't resist.
Tom has keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the mining people so I can cheer up.
How would you feel if someone treated you like that?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do anything he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us anecdotes.
The hatch can be used in many dishes.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
The tree was hit by lightning.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened my purse.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Tom's coming with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll be speaking English.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't hang up.
Tell Ton to keep him out of sight.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
Do you want to work with them?
The movie was interesting.
I work from morning till evening.
How long are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's gonna happen to Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He aimed at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Come on!
I have to go on.
She put her nose on the glass.
English do not differ in the terms ser and estar.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Do you have any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing an SMS while driving is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many hands do you have?
The mill was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to talk to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody has something to hide.
We'll have several guests tonight.
Her voice will still be in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
It's time for treatment.
Why do you always take sides with him?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss it.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some birds did not fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told him you came to Australia.
Have you been looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I supposed to wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught by a snowstorm.
The book's on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his wishes.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm in the stairs.
It's the largest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can you imagine me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told him Mary needed to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning on going to Australia?
Someone was screaming.
What's the best?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train is going to three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Clear the beast from the cage.
He's scared of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you were told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on having a son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas pushed off the door.
My dad is an English teacher.
At Christmas Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.
Hold on to the pearls.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
How many beakers on the table?
Counsel has convincing evidence that she is innocent.
Maybe.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
It is only in philosophy that a vicious circle of evidence can be used and commended.
I can't afford to have children.
When I approached them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't get these bastards to understand their own language.
Should I go?
I was so stupid I believed it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
The owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French hard, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger was over.
We need more firewood.
Tom said Mary was angry.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Is Paris far away?
How long is it in Tokyo?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna be snowing for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like to have some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would have done.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to pay for me.
She's cold.
Tom said he's looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's tasket Mary by the hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazy one I know.
Mary's already out of her room?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a rabbler.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.
He publicly offended me.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in the induction plates for direct heating of the pot and pans.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombonne.
Get out of here now.
Can I take a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I've got two tickets for a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's blithe's hot.
He dictated several letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajama?
How much is it worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half-third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want, in Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still don't think so well.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary had no thirst.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought it would be.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom.
They say the movie's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for heavy rain.
It seems she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Watch your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
How long do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We've done this together before.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no winners.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're packed.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow last night?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you kill her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defence.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll climb to the top of the mountain.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve this problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes glistened and turned open, and his usually pale face came alive and covered itself with a Romanian.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands fell from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not at all busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was accepted as his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why do you call?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to doing this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, all of a sudden in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't like to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
The day after yesterday, our granddaughter was born.
Toma's got a pirate suit.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the yellow one.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom has to be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We are proud of our achievement.
So we should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sing every day.
She became e-mail.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one he claims to be?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald Sinsubei, introduced Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing wrong.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to burn flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Have you had any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Hermann Hesse.
I've never really spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought to trial, it is generally accepted that there should be twelve juries in the trial.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys were marching four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
It's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, let's go, we'll be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom's playing trombonne.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You're probably not gonna be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Eat some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Get off me, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from a low self - control?
Was that too easy?
What Alice encountered while waiting for an answer was a sudden noise, so loud that she would break her eardrums and so loud that she could reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go in there.
Tom helped Mary carry things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked him for.
What do you hate her for?
My washing machine's broken.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying in vain to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it up.
Why doesn't Tom sleep?
Just like he's gonna end up responding.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbs into a tree.
The language I teach is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I strongly believe in his innocence.
The president reigns for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Could you resolve this question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
Twenty floor buildings.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have a picture of Tom.
Can you wait a little longer?
Are you gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you work with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man right now.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind coming up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try and jump with a parachut.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as a donkey.
I think you can rely on me.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a premonition that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom talked in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but I got some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell the man you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for worse.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing Mayones with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a bit of a smile.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
Don't get mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
That's why I came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and orderly.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in a strange land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face was painted.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Famine was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rat?
How long do you want to leave?
She had legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get here, there'll be time to open.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas is away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
What are you doing?
The milk can be made from butter, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Be nice.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unnamed guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as they expected.
He blinked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think you'd ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say it in human language?
No one's hungry except for me.
Tom's really excited.
No snowflake in the snowy lava doesn't feel guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like that?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When's the shop opening?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's to spit once.
I really liked that book.
You are important.
When the ice melts, it becomes water.
Jane asked Mary if she could stay overnight.

Look at him.

I don't know.
There's nothing in nature that's useless.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're coming.
I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I shut the door, but I didn't lock it.
So we should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'm commanding the parade!
People who are good to us all.
I'm not sorry about you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20.
She thought I'd let her down.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom brought his secret with him to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?

We're collecting blankets for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very decent salary.
What do you think?
Let's have breakfast quick.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why are we all looked at?
Where's Tom's key?
Did I make your name right?
No one saw her leave the room.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tom's never gonna find him.
All women are the same.
He let them walk in the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your love is false.
She's about my age.
Did you really do it for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys are always boys, girls are girls.
Turn off the radio.
There's nothing new about his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't understand the risks.
That's why you don't have to do it anymore.

Let's go home.
You have time.

You can't do it.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for someone?

So I didn't have to hide.

That's a good sign.
Some are convinced that they are protected by a guardian angel.
Tom ruined his bank account.
She's in the hotel right now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid his attention to it.
I told him I didn't care.

I saw him naked.
There's a lot of children's books in our library.

Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't stop singing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The resulting stain, however, left a trail on his skirt.
Is Tom dating someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you came back, I was gone.
Did you talk to him today?

I thought you hated us.
Think before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it as a joke and I didn't answer it.
His name wasn't Tom Jackson.
That's sarcasm?
Don't do anything you'll regret later.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I decided I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to you and your family.

I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?

There are no exceptions in the esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't survive for anything.
Tom didn't think Mary would be upset.
There's a shopping area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom's a hot drinker.
We don't even know her.
Tom made some suggestions and checked them for Mary before he poured them on Tatob.
I know where you're hiding your money.
The school is finally over.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about this?

The coffee shop's empty.
Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.

It's the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?

At times Claudia was thinking about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back later tonight too.

Don't leave the tape in the sun.
I already knew that.

Can I open the curtain?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He threw out exactly as much as he drank.
Let the earth be your swell, Father!

Tom's making breakfast.
Come in.
I'm taking them off for my grandchildren.

How's Tom?
Tom says he never did.
Tom seems like a nice person.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to get under the fence.

Help finally came.
It's a horse.
This is what happened here on Monday.

Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often spends hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded his car.
Tom knew about Mary something John didn't know.
There's no answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I was shaking my head negatively.
Tom, you're on the phone.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Come see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think it works like that.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you coming tomorrow?
A box with openings.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is this a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I have to know.
You can't force me to marry you.
It's pretty weird.
Yellow leaves.
I woke up and she's gone.
We have plenty to eat today.
He gave a speech in which he supported my point of view.

Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.

Have a seat, please.
Wake Tom.
Here's the map.

Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you didn't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not gonna complain.
They kept their love secret.
She would rush at the station only then to delay the train.
Don't say that to my fiancee.
Tom's tired of always paying the bill when he and Mary go out on a date.
I strongly recommend that you reconsider your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.

Although I felt it was strange, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
The bear's black.
Tom never knows what Mary did.
I don't know who's gonna be in the meeting.
It's hard to approach the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right now.
I don't trust her.
Six three is eighteen.
“Scale” is an anagram of “lasques”.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a rally against racism.
You did it quickly.
I need to take two minutes forward.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did a great job.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised all of us.
This is where she worked as secretary.
They're not so bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.

Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
You think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do this.

I already said everything you think you should know about it.
Health gives a person freedom that most people don't realize until they lose it.
Does it matter?
I know Tom's secret.

That's not surprising.
The hare's got blood out of his ear.
Post-moderisticism is different from modernism.

I'm not afraid of that at all.

I sell clothes online.
I could've done it faster when I was younger.
I wasn't worried.

It's incredible.
The sky is covered with clouds.
This bird is threatened with extinction.
You've been very happy with her.
How you doing?

He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village was called her Green Chapochka.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.
It's a work you can get into.

Tom won't mind.
Nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.
Did he blow his pants off?

That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train will be on this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think would be the most secure place?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the guy who drew this picture.
"Call up" means calling on the phone.
Who would notice?

They can't afford it.
What kind of colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq differs from Iran.
So they told me not to do this on their own.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have some coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself and started waving my hands.
I'm with you.

Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary study French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Soon it's your turn, Bashar!
You're worthless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they'll do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want that for anyone.
Tom's gonna work this weekend.
Tell her, please, I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President's attempts to impose more stringent arms control once and for all were thwarted by powerful arms lobbyes.

Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've got enough time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my father's a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain the situation to Mache.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one paid attention to me.
That's why there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay forward.
You made coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually speak too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he demonstrated his solemnity.
Why did Tom need him?
It's an investment of capital.
It's really bitter.
I didn't have enough time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
It's thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What actually happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these ink spots can be taken out.
I told you everything I should have told you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his lazyness.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.

They offered us their help.
Tom firmly decided to kiss Macha.
Are you really hungry?
What's gonna happen to him?
Tom and I are casual friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's kind of famous.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting's hanging on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom's with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I've prepared Tom's dinner.
Russia has become a second super-Power.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to the mail to send a letter.
See that powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those ready lunches sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in position.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about four thousand dollars per month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only survivor.
Are you going to buy this car?
You speak like my grandmother.
I don't have any siblings.
Let's see something else.
You think that's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to go on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to dinner on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You're not gonna turn off the radio?
I certainly don't remember what Tom said.
Tom's a skilled player.
I wasn't ready for this.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?
Yesterday you left the bar just when I was going to give everyone a drink at my expense.
Tom told me it really works.
I want to play chess.
I'm supporting you 100%.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We don't have much snow here.
Don't open that box.
I hate waiting.
I sometimes see him at the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get those pictures?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I've been in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him down.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage your money.
How does one relate to another?
I was able to do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where did Tom sleep?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
The equator divides the land into two hemispheres.
He's a landman.
I've never seen anything like this.
Trees give shade.
It was taken with a shelf.
Tom doesn't know where it is.
Tom doesn't know where Mary works.

Who are you to decide?

In summer, nothing compares to the ice cream.
I saw her play the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like driving?
The car didn't move.
Mary knows she was wrong.
It's a little bit too tight.
Trying to stay calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke quickly.
So you didn't have to deceive Mary.
The baby's in the cradle.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom cut off the offer and copied it.
You could've hurt yourself.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you're working.

Do you remember their names?
I'm eating a bite.
I didn't wait for them.

I'd like to talk to you in private.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine sells well.
Her clothes got a lot of attention at the party.
Tomorrow they're gonna get married.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They pulled lots of lots to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he'd catch a cold.
I like spending time with my friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.

Tom wants you to help him do this.
She's got a very tense schedule.
Tom speaks French, too.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
There were tiger lilys in the garden.
I told her not to do this.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do it.
We've come to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in the toys drawer.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, everybody ignores me." "Look!
He's got one goal in his life to earn money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
You have a letter.
Thomas's grandfather didn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom was staying at the hotel.
I explained it to her.

You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I meet new people every day.
I want to go out with him.
You failed Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom terribly.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I kept him behind the collar.
No one wants you to do this.
I forgot it was April one today.
Please stop singing that song!

Why do you jump?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why you were scared?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do this.
If it warms up, it melts.
We could have done that.
The doctor said he needed surgery.
I've been changing toothpaste recently.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who knocks at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I came to visit you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
Everyone's silent.
Let the dust settle down.
Why are you so stubborn?
He got trapped in her Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal practices, he got into almost every meeting.
I'm glad to let you know that I'm fully cured.
I wrote a lot of suggestions on the esperanto.
I like the ship more than the pastor.
I can't make an exception.
He's quick to think.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pay the bill.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try and distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better prepared than me.
He swims like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought meth.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say that in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus minus gives plus.
The basement's dead.
Please donate.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane’s farewell speech made us very sad.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look dark.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't hold back his smile.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought better before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in a city?
The interrogation's over.
Please turn off the radio.
It seemed he was not sure about his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There's so many of them.
He could not compromise principles.
Mary says she's single.
You're probably gonna have three hours to do this.
That was an easy solution.
Mary said she'd be early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anybody.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Lastly, it had solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my thoughts.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He was jumping from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's going inside.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly wore Tom's shirt.
It seems that the bank robbery was planned up to small things.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a little longer.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
Do you like it more?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't be mad at us.
You don't have to answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish alligator from crocodile?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to tell him you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
May I?
The whole people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower this morning?
Okay, everybody, listen to me, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry!
I think Tom is my friend.
Counting on remaining ignorant and free, the nation relies on something that has never been and will never be.
Tom barely breathes.
Dogs don't tell color.
Tom poured water out of a bottle before he filled it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
I need to tell him he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making an appearance.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
So it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
All attention!
That same second, I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my dear friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have walked alone in the woods.
No one sees my tears.
Tom fell asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repeated.
Tom's never kissed anyone.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to the manager about the noise in our neighbors.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As soon as you meet him, you'll see him.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any synthesis is dangerous, especially that.
You could've stayed in Boston.
There's nobody there.
Can you write it as a chiragana, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you the way I do.
Be appropriate for your age.
Do you know how to ferment?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I'm not suffering the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatob's stopping today.
Sally had her brother clean up the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of disorder.
The conference room is busy.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
I'm not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's gone down here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You said so many times yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?
The art satellite was launched into orbit.
I'm absolutely serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too easy.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war starts?
I told them the bank didn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He's got a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account should be paid by the first number of the following month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
Boston is a cold town for me, not like Chicago.
Tom was a victim of extortion.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The dispute ended with a fight.
I didn't take him, you can check his pockets.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to leave the notes.
You chose the wrong man.
They risked great.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do that, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the road, there was a carriage with mulams.
Tom speaks French to his grandparents and English to his parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
It's all dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't want to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be said.
He got out of bed.
Trains are on schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it is impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why does Tom avoid me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
Leila gave her own computer.
Roll up your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom's gonna agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can become president, but it's probably not true.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long does the train arrive?
How long does this train get to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected Mary and John were dating each other.
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him a cookie.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You can't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Put it in French, please.
Get the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me about what happened.
Cossie and kill him.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers with those of Tom.
Tom's got a weak heart.
That's why you're gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test's easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Anyone here to meet them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many broad avenues in this city.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand this color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got flaws.
I wonder why Tom needs this.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
You're a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
Titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you find him?
The meeting took a long time.
I'll recognize you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
Don't do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get it together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he was in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not gonna buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
She's got the highest grades.
Tom might be in a mood.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What kind of color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the sleeping jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Can you lend me some notes or something?
I want to relax in front of the TV this night, and I don't want to leave home.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
It's only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put her hands on her hands to keep them warm.
Tom said he was glad you were back.
My car's covered with blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've been waiting all my life this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane entered the truck.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary fainted.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read that book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," Tom said softly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the checkbook.
You don't need to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any other questions?
A new offer is like a message in a bottle: one day they'll translate it.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are family souls.
I have a grandson of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started to develop in her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing this yesterday.
It's a little early, isn't it?
My parents don't like my style of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him with a trap and a big one.
Because it's worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I have your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about kissing.
The series must begin to watch when all seasons have been cancelled!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go skiing?
You were in a hairdresser?
The prospect is disheartening.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a balloon handle.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
You're gone.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
Everyone knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brake go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was shaken by the explosion.
Tom kissed Mary, and they embraced.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is an arrogant idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I believe you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks throwing away food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked about this with Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved.
Let's go to church.
Tom rubbed the whisky.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I didn't meet him sweeter.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know that boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The thief will steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim too well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was nothing but a shadow of himself.
How do we do it?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give him another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I must stay together.
I've only heard of him as good.
I don't work here anymore.
Which do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not like us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'm never gonna throw out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's case's empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell him I'm going to come to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to bother him.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm just thinking about trying things like this.
I don't really know about hunting.
It's the first time I've been cooking meat on a gel.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
That's what everyone knew.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to pay.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking of.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I've been scrambling every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's a sour apple.
The number of tickets has been limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're taking a job at home?
According to Mythology, Prometheus stole a sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get out of the bus before it set fire to fire.
I want to help you figure it out.
You speak French better than I do.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't matter to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bicycle's gone.
The stars were dying in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Oh, it's so boring here." "My dear boy, it's all the way to this world." "That's all we can do." "That's OK, I'm going to grab my sword!" -- "The Sword's gone." -- "The Sword's gone!" -- "How can we be written, only the Link can defeat the Genon." -- "How can we possibly." -- "No, I'm going to grab my sword!" -- "The Sword's gone." -- "The Sword's gone!" -- "How can you do that?" -- "It's a gun with a skull." -- "Yes, it's no." -- "It's no." -- "How about smoke bombs?" -- "No." -- "No." -- "How the hell do you do you?" -- "Yes!
Do you know who sings this song?
Are your watch coming right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom barely knows how to swim.
You're good at it.
I met her on my way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm heading for Tom home.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary put the blankets down.
A is a lot consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you would like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
That's what they told me three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during Louis XVI's reign.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
I want to bathe in the sea.
It will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was surrounded by the power.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, no food.
There'll be snow tomorrow.
You should've quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nubes, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bicycle?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
So they weren't allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom is waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks amazingly like Maryyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn to for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deep regret as she looked back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.

Tom was sitting in one cell with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He's got a beer.
Today, it's the most difficult thing for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom, wake up!
I'm keeping my nosewear.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She got out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The hares are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still shocked.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Are you trying to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better this morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the hot rubber?
This isn't what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom took Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet with sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
A traveler is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, isn't he?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her.
I've got it all working.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?
I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Denomemit invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What chemical sign is methyl bromide?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to the lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, though I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied his sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to come with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls, is it cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance to win.
Are you planning on staying for long?
We had a quick meal, and immediately we left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't put anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you ever call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The purse was opened.
I brought some wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you until I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he was not sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Does she sing?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Thomas?
Let's drive the car.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
Tree's sick.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a United States citizen.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is this drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You won't recognize her?
I didn't ask him if Tom planned to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears a new shoe.
Last year she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
As I walked down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephant tufts are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's not a wet coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Nailness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is insect collection.
Tom's baby lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them that?
She kept quiet all day.
No matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went further.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very friendly, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under bulbs.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Sorry to upset you.
Those who have never left their country are full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when it snows.
Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I included imagination.
I thought we could do it.
My mom didn't want me to drive alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
The machine transfer can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing more than a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner was released.
What, they said happened?
Could you leave the door open?
We'll have to wait with that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice as old as me.
Tom knows what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that one day I'm going to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain's stopped, you can open the windows again.
I've never had that before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with it.
Always give up on the right.
We're asked to take turns.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's pretty, but I don't like her.
I can drop you if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my lover!
Your voice sounds like a melodious siren song to me.
What does it mean to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French doesn't get much better.
How do I get the best passport?
Perhaps you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom hasn't been paying attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Get some more light.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but it's about to be mine.
Have you forgotten what his name is?
If I had time to do this, I'd do it.
You see Tom's boat?
Thomas the big one?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noises.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
There's nobody I can trust.
She's a sex fan in a big city.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day’s work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a breath here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She was slamming up the thunder when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
That peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom doesn't like it.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that a scientist of that level would have made such a basic mistake.
He doesn't have any evidence.
You don't look well.
He was very good at swimming when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you gonna tell me?
I didn't mean to tell you that.
I've filled the pots.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
Which house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we doing?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I don't drive too often.
So you don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him to forgive me.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were in school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
There'll be a big snowfall tomorrow.
We decided to postpone the meeting to next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom's a flyer.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at foreigners.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your kids, would you?
That's why Mary and I should rest.
He went to bed.
It could have been worse.
Tom made his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
Someday you'll get there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did it for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times as much as Mary.
I drank milk.
There'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, Mary won't be compared.
You haven't been on your own lately.
Tom lost his leg in the shark attack.
I'm a scooter for you.
We'll do it like time will do.
I'll be three times as old as you next year.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's a little bit higher than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This cloth is sticking to your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's winter soon.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do this.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was only a few times.
This time you've gone too far.
It works.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
No wonder Tom answered.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches older than Mary.
I'm glad you offered this.
Your question is difficult to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
That sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why would you need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She'll split up.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give them to him.
Run or you'll get arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made himself the rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
Nobody understands me.
There's so many stars in the sky, I can't count them.
Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do something a few times.
Let's wash the dish today who's going to lose the gun-thorn!
I'm so unhappy!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's running away speaking Russian -- at least he said that to me.
Tom's a third grader.
How long will you stay?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was crowded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The Orchestra started playing.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?
Tom didn't want to be a snitch.
He was born at seven o'clock in the morning on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thank you for helping me.
We only have three rules.
She bought herself.
The guards didn't see Tom.
In recent years Tom has become noticeably small.
I helped move those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are tired.
I kept lying to my wife.
Finally, she succeeded.
It's a gross shame that they weren't safe from fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The exam was divided into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Uh, you're so boring here!
Reading a book is like reading a trip.
Tom saw Mary enter the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me how to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I don't take out the wrong kids.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She showed me her talents.
I wish it were possible.
I'm assuming you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Bob's next school festival will be the first time he's ever played a major role.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been doing seeds all day.
I mean, I figured he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Compassionate!
Tom complied.
All the people of my generation feel the same way about it.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least we had some fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad is slowly getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It's not going to end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling goods at home, then maybe it's a new way of getting to know girls?
Tom picked up the coin.
Why didn't you clean up your room?
If there is no God, it's permitted.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New one?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please tie your belts during takeoff and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'm going to have too much time to explain why this doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to summer leave.
Can we put it differently?
From here he looks great.
Wood houses light up easily.
Let's have a party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to university.
I know you lied.
It's very comfortable.
I'll report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a jerk.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it a little bit.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need it anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix this.
I'm not going to have fun tonight, I need to get ready for class.
Mary was the only girl in her skirt.
What bird can't fly?
It has to be put to an end.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at seventy years of age.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French as well.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here are some photos.
What's going on channel ten?
I hate spinach.
My mother's cooking dinner.
Tom is a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to let his emotions go.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You just take note of the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault that this happened.
He's like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You catch it all up in the summer.
Let's give him a lead.
Let's leave this till tomorrow.
Perhaps Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing is wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaner interrupted the conversation.
The cat's on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't snore anymore.
Tom was a big smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to such weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him paint snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family life?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He put the glass down.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is the attack.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five Avocado.
The Japanese live in rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't do that?
We were driving back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe it?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
Stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's running out of his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bicycle.
I'm not talking to the calf at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They're not on time.
It's seven thirty now.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said it to To.
Tom got up early to see dawn.
Dinosaurs died long ago.
I usually go up steps in one.
Tom had another year.
I'm outside the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm gonna get out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom's only thirty years old.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed so long.
The knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon adjust to village life.
Keep a bucket of water next to you.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
There's a deeper river.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm really cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they are to be written plumbingly is a major problem in the Norwegian language.
What do you do with the remaining rice?
Ten years have passed since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon thereafter.
This book is worth reading.
Tom and Mary taught before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The wife's not a boots, you can't drop her leg.
I'll pick you up at six.
I teach Tom French.
I like to teach other languages.
Mary's got brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom's planned to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He sells cars.
Are you still in contact with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave Mary's gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to get on the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smelling.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to business.
Tom was sitting on steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning hits twice in one place.
I'm not boasting.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door locked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Make your own decision.
You were surprised?
We counted the annual ring on the tree we cut and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you all my life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
Rabbits proliferate quickly.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
How much is your coat cleaning?
We'll paint it.
The opening is narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come to anything.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the petition.
Have you been trying to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know so much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Would you like them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
It was I who told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
In the near future, we can meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a dragonman.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me posted.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom's gonna like it.
