White pawn f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black business on h4 mat!
White: A1 pack to b6, c8 black: foot to a7 and b7, king to a8, elephant to b8. White to b8. White to b8. White toss a togwang to a6 and then blacks only have two options: take a6 or move an elephant to any other field of diagonal b8 to h2. In the first case, whites move a foot from b6 to b7 and set a mat. In the second case, the white system takes a black foot to a7 with the same result.
