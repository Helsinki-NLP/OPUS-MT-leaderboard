Number of new recruits who are in preparation for departure to Donbasa from Ukraine
Andrei Marochko, official representative of the People ' s Police of the Self-Proclaimed Lugan People ' s Republic (LPR), stated that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbas.
According to him, that's how Kiev plans to "simplify units."
“The refusal of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, mass dismissals have resulted in a low level of strength of the units”, said Marochko, quoted as “RIA News”.
He also did not exclude that the actual figures for the Ukrainian military could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a Joint Force (JLA).
The measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian militia in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasa was exacerbated by the assassination of the head of NAMA, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The NAM authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
Several persons involved in the explosion were arrested during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary evidence, they confirmed that the occupation had been organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.
The U.S. authorities forced Muska to resign as President of the Tesla Executive
American businessman Ilon Musk will resign as chairman of the board of directors of the Tesla company, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to resolve the claims of the Federal Security and Exchange Commission, the business will also pay $20 million to cover the claims of the Federal Security and Exchange Commission.
According to the CNBC, pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Muska to remain in the leadership position in Tesla.
However, he is obliged to pay $20 million and to resign from the office of Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to his place.
It is specified that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the United States Security and Exchange Commission had accused Muska of misleading shareholders of having sufficient funds to buy the company ' s shares and had filed an application with a businessman.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy a $420 share for a piece, but never did.
After Twitter, the company grew by almost 11 per cent.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being a prisoner of the community.
This statement was made by a diplomat at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail points out, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to a belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” said the Minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes "Hazeta.ru".
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Brexit talks had come to a halt.
It thus commented on the outcome of the European Union's informal summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but many factors are complicating negotiations with Brussels on this issue.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London has left the community.
In addition, the question remains on the Irish border.
Two dogs were given to the South Korean President by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's mushrooms
South Korean President Mun Jae In received a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong Yun, two puppies after his visit to Pyongyang.
This is what Reuters reports with reference to the South Korean President's administration representative.
"In the course of the summit, a pair of hunsan dogs were offered as a gift.
They were received on Thursday," reported to the department.
Dogs for about a year, “as an aid for their adaptation”, the North Korean side handed over several kilograms of food.
A gift was given in honor of the inter-Korean summit held from 18 to 20 September in Pyongyang.
The hunsan hunting species of North Korean wolves were named from one of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea districts.
As noted by the agency, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, which he was given by the former North Korean leader Kim Chen Il.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong Eun also handed over two tons of macute mushrooms to his colleague.
He ordered the distribution of these mushrooms to members of the families that had been separated during the Korean war, who had not yet been reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.
The head of the Albanian village stopped hunger strike in defence of the interests of the inhabitants
The government reported on its Facebook page that they had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village stated that the situation had stalled, his demands had not been met by the district administration and he had to do his job.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has begun to verify the situation, and the thermal service organization of SPC has promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberski village next week.
The villagers also made and took away the Governor of Altay province mass collective treatment “in response to the present catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he was feeling normal and that he had fully assumed his responsibilities as head of hunger strikers.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Siberia and Rogulos have centralized heating systems, and therefore the administration of the Pervomaya district must exercise authority to prepare them for winter.
To date, however, no one has begun to do this work.
The village chief also protested the lack of proper control and support from the Government of Altay Province and against the financial policy of Gaspromez Regionz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded “immediately to organize a full-fledged municipal community site with the appropriate staffing units in the municipality”.
Moscow ' s new constructions with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of the year of 2018, about 3,000 units of housing were purchased in Moscow's new buildings, with a cost of up to four million roubles.
More than half of these transactions were for two LCs, as shown in the Urbanus portal (available by Lenta.ru).
Up to four million roubles have been managed by Nkrasovka LK, located behind ICAD, in the Kotelniki region (UWAO), and by the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibirevo region (SWAO).
Two LKs in New Moscow - “South Bunino” and “Clint Alleys” - were also seen as part of their transactions with fiscal housing.
Urbanus analysts note that up to four million roubles in these projects reach 60 per cent of all sales and provide half of the total revenue.
“The impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million roubles on the commercial achievements of the “Central” neighbourhood in the “New Vatutincas” and the “Philatov Lug” JCs should be recognized,” says a study of two other LLCs in New Moscow.
They account for about 35 per cent of financial income.
In the past, Moscow districts with the cheapest apartments in the new buildings have been rated by Bong Ton property agency.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand roubles per metre) were recorded in UWAO in September 2018.
In the second and third places, WAO and SWAO found themselves with indicators of 184.1 and 192.8 thousand roubles, respectively.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
The users of the iPhone complained about the problems of the Messinger Telegram following an update that had taken place on 28 September.
The user's phone number can be found in his June office.
Complaints relate to assumptions with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after updating, the application shows a white screen or closes up immediately.
Messinger's representatives responded to the malfunction.
They said that the problem could be the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended automatic updating of the application until the problems were resolved.
On 13 April, the Tagan court of Moscow granted the claim of Roskomnadzor to block Mr. Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the liaison operators began implementing the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the Messinger Administration to provide the FSB with the keys necessary to decode the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed the policy of confidentiality and agreed to disclose the IP address and the number of the mobile phone of a suspected terrorist user when a court decision was reached.
Telegram Auditorium after FF locking decreased by 1.2 million

I'm glad for the guys who came out to realize the numerical advantage of a game with a mined Dinamo.
The chief coach of Avangarda, Bob Hartley, summarized the results of the regular CFL championship game against Mining Dinamo (2:1).
Very important to us is our victory.
After a match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave this game behind and prepare for Minsk.
We knew Dinamo had a good victory before we met, so we prepared ourselves very seriously.
It was important to drop out in the majority, and I'm glad for the guys who were going to realize the numerical advantage.
We've played pretty well for most of the time, but we couldn't kill them.
Finally, the red light behind the gate is on fire.
We knew Minsk would get loaded up on the game, try and do it.
Most of the game has become the defining, winning goal we've killed in unequal terms.
We were able to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we had missed an early goal in this period and it was clear that it would be difficult for us to do so.
But we played very well in defense, we didn't give much chance to the rival, we weren't allowed to be caught in shifts, Denamo didn't have an attack with a number of advantages, so it ended well for us, and then Hartley's press service at the Om Club.

Sergey Semak, chief trainer of the Santerburg “Zenita”, commented on the first defeat of his team during this season.
In the ninth round of the Russian football championship, the blue blue and blue football champions came over to the Mahhakalinian Angeli with an account of 1:2.
I don't appreciate it, two teams play, and the same guys have shown once again that good luck needs to be earned.
Well, of course, luck was on Angie's side, both the briefcases and the goal.
It's clear that this was preceded by our gross mistakes," says Semak Championship.com.
Also, the chief coach, Zenita, noted that his football players in the first time with the Mahhakalin team acted very slowly, allowing the rival to create a lot of go-side moments.
Remember that the Machakalin Angi at home won the Zenit account 2:1, which defeats the champion's leader in the current season.
He's been jokingly promising to stop Putin's champagne shower.
The commander of the Mercedes team, Lewis Hemilton, who was the winner of the 16th phase of the "Formules 1" champion of the Russian Grande, vowed, in jest, not to arrange for Russian President Vladimir Putin's champagne soul as in 2015.
"This time I'm not going to water you with champagne, and this time it was someone else," he said during a brief conversation with the head of State, handing over TAS.
Putin laughed in reply and shook the driver's shoulder.
"It's all right," said the Russian leader, commenting on the situation of three years ago.
The Russian Grand "Formules 1" was held at Soci Autodrome from 28 to 30 September.
The second was the Finnish Mercedes pilot Walter Bottas.
The third was the German Ferrari racer Sebastian Fetel.
The Russian leader congratulated Heilton on his victory and presented him with a reward.
Traditionally, "Formules 1" will open champagne after the award.

RBC reported an early resignation of the Governor of Kurgan State
The Governor of Kurgan province, Alexei Cochorin, will resign as part of the new rotation of the Governor ' s Corps, referring to two sources close to the President ' s administration.
The decision will be officially reported in the near future, notes the publication.
One of the main reasons for Mr. Cocorin ' s departure is that the region remained depressed, with low socio-economic development.
Alexei Cochorin had not completed his first Governor's term, and his term was due to expire in 2019.
He was elected in September 2014 with a vote of 84.87 per cent.
Prior to the appointment of the Governor ' s Vvorio in February 2014, Mr. CoCorin served as head of the city of Shadrinsk (Kurgan Province).
We will recall that on Wednesday, 26 September, President Vladimir Putin held a number of staff appointments for regional heads.

Ilon Musk has been forced to leave the post of head of the Board of Directors
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission and founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, Musuu would have to leave the post of head of the Board of Directors of Tésla as part of the agreements reached.
At the same time, the Commission allowed Muska to retain the post of Chief of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla would also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount is being recovered from Tesla.
However, money is distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American businessman who is on the list of 50 richest people on the Forbes version of the magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX, Neurallink neurotechnologies and tesla electricians, and Paypal co-founder.
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission had previously sued the Director General of Tesla Ilona Muska because of his Twitter report on the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on a fixed price exchange of $420.
The value of the $420 share was established “because of the importance of this number in the marijuana culture”, earlier reported by Bloomberg with reference to Stephen Peykin, Co-Director of the Security Division of the Commission.
However, Ilon Musk subsequently declined his plans to purchase shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit brought against him by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered fraud charges unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and upset by those claims.
"Evidence is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I haven't broken it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against Muska, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder stated that tweets by a businessman had been misleading, forcing Tesla's shareholders to purchase paper at artificially overvalued prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Muska’s reckless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Muska also accused the head of the research company Simon Research.
However, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the U.S. securities and exchanges commission, he would be in danger of being suspended from the company’s management and even from prison.
In particular, the former Chairman of Commission Harvey Pitt stated this to CNBC.
Musk is "a good guy who doesn't know how to drive a car company."

Mitropolitan Volocolam Ilarion - The causes of the conflict with Constantinople patriarchate, possibly church division and its political subtext
He said that now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage”, to change the name of the church is the same as in German Fascist Germany, “Jews have a yellow six-star”.
“It means to mark the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill has been created”, said the representative of the RPC on television, “Russia 24”.
Mithropolita also stressed that UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, since “Christians of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are Patriots of their country”.

Gran Per Sochi: Antelig, Russian ill and the return of Kwan
During the next ten years, Russia may have its own race sickness.
This is what Vice-Prime Vice-Preamer Dmitri Kozak said, taking stock of a meeting with Russian motorists the day before the Grand Primitive of Russia started in Sochi.

The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future, just the establishment of the Russian ill “Formula-1”, which has no parallel in the world,” said Dmitri Kozak.
We need to educate our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible.
I think a more realistic time frame is over the next 10 years."
From 2012 to 2014, the Russian-licenced Marusha was under Russian licence.
According to the Vice-Primeyer, there are already investors who are willing to invest in building a national team in the World Motorway Championships World in Forum One.
I know that in Russia there were car sports lovers, wealthy businessmen who were willing to invest, ready to invest in the establishment of a Russian team called Forum One, he said.
“We are prepared to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of establishing a team has also emerged because of the existence of such infrastructure in Sochi.”
Tomorrow's Soci Autodrom is waiting for the antelope.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to carry out all 50,000 tickets.

I can say that this year's revenue increased by 72% compared to last year.
It's a good, positive outcome.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the use of Soci Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak didn't go around and the main topic of the day was for Russian car lovers -- the return of Daniel Quest to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success in the next season,” said the vice-premier, “I'm sorry.
He's a high hopes racer.
Next year, for the first time in the history of the Pylot "Formules 1", two major Russian pilots will be able to participate at once.

His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results have not yet been impressive: he took the 18th place in the course of the Great in Russia.
Let us hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year,” said Dmitri Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The opening of the penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought world fame to Fleming and made it the Nobel Laureate.
By the way, the removal of penicillin from the mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, while he was in a cold spot, he had scribbled from his own nose on Petri's cup (this is a glass lid in which he has experience with bacteria) and after a few days found that the bacteria there were destroyed.
It was almost as by accident that they were found to be penicillin.
The name Fleming has been placed on the list of the 100 most prominent individuals in history.

Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had been so involved with the DPRK that they couldn't even reach the country's authorities -- they didn't take the phone down there.
The United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "pretty letters" to the White House, said Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, there was also a "favour" against Kim Chen Yun, which was, in fact, mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has improved so much that the leaders have “in love with one another”.
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the United States media interpreted them as incompetence.

Nitya called for the replacement of "Moscow Language by Ukrainian Product"
Ukrainian child writer and champion for the purity of Laris Nitsa mother tongue called for the expulsion of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do so, she offers a Ukrainian product, a “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nietz’s views on “the feasibility of eradicating Russian in Ukraine” were shared with the Ukrainian edition of “Assistant”.
She said that the relevant Ukrainian product was now being prepared -- it was even eating and was continuing to evolve.
In time, Ukrainians were “healthy” from this “moskovic language”, she was convinced.
In neighboring Poland, for example, she said that Russian speech was used extensively on television and radio before, but that it was practically out of place in public space.
In the view of Nice, however, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities to prohibit the use of Russian are, in her view, merely “the expansion of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nitza had previously shared her experience of maintaining the Ukrainian-speaking regime at the Carpathian Children's Camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which had been contacted by her in Russian.
If she didn't get her own way, Nitsa threw herself into a girl's hand.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians, she calls it "language schizophrenia", calling on the Ukrainians to refuse Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nice recently stated that the name "Russia" had been stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not escape the Dwarf: by coming there and hearing the conversation between the officers in Russian, she had done a scandal and had gone away by slamming the door.

"This difficult game was done, and there was a serious male conversation in the intermission, and it bore its fruit: two balls were killed and it was not missed.
"You've been missing a few matches because of the damage you've received at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If I've had 90 minutes, then it's okay!
I really felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day, there's a little bit of strength to make sure nothing happens.
Doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolevich Gashneev led me to this game, for which they are grateful!
"What about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and rebuilding, it's easier, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we had a white stripe, although we had a black first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the fans."
"I miss the game for the time I didn't get out on the field?"
"There's something that's a little boring because it's really unpleasant.
But over and over again, thank the physiotherapist and the doctors who've been put on their feet.
The most important thing is that we've won and advised the fans.
The rest of it is secondary."

The indictment for the Dagestan deputy was news.
The Council District Court of Mahhakala detained for two months a member of the Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov People ' s Assembly suspected of participating in a criminal community that formed a disability for bribes.
The “sudden” details of the investigation have come to light as to how, in the case of the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former Head of the Republic of Ramasana, Abdulativov Rajab Abdulatipov, has now contributed to the criminal action of the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Assessment, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, the operational and investigative activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs found that Rajab Abdulatipov had been lobbying for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that purpose.
Recall that earlier criminal proceedings were initiated against Magodomed Mahachev, other leaders and staff of the territorial medical and social assessment offices under his supervision under article 210 (establishment of a criminal community using and participating in a position of office), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (service fraud) and article 159 (especially large-scale fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdoulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his associates who had stolen funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities in joining the criminal community.
In his capacity as head of the Russian Federal Migration Service for Dagestan, and in connection with State authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as in his relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdultatikov, the investigators “received the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with State officials to support the illegal activities of Magod Mahachev and his presence as head of the federal treasury institution, the Chief Bureau of Medical and Social Assessment for the Republic of Dagestan”, organized the illegal establishment of persons with disabilities for citizens”.
Following the announcement of these information at the meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdultatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being charged to me today is new to me, and I don't know it," he said.
The Court arrested a deputy from “One Russia” not for 10 days prior to the indictment, as had been the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months immediately, as he appeared in article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time to charge an investigation, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

In addition, according to Serbian media, the meeting of heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for Tuesday, 2 October, and writes “Lenta.ru”.
The day before, it became known that the Serbian President had brought the State army fully ready because of the situation with Kosovo.
This is what happened on Friday, when several dozen Kosovo Special Forces entered the area that is adjacent to the lake providing water to the Gaza Hydrowater Power Plant.
It is specified that the above-mentioned NPP is located in Kosovo, but it relates to the Serbian power system.
Recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but refused to recognize this fact in Belgrade.
In the spring of last year, the parties terminated negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the subject of Russia was practically missing in a negative way
The Head of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out its being able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more depressed”, said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes “assigned as one of the three main threats to humanity, while the Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, had been in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries that had been sufficiently unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Cosachev emphasized that “the subject of Russia was practically missing”.
"If I look closely at the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I don't take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the chorus wasn't exactly right," the politician remarked, noting that Russia "was not more than a wall trained by a tennis ball."
The Head of the Sovfed Professional Committee does not rule out a certain trend, which he believes “will distinguish the current session of the [UN General Assembly], although this trend may take place in one year, two, three”.
“I do not exclude that this session can in some sense be a turning session”, admitted Kosachev, explaining that “less than many examples of Russia's ability to move forward with Russian involvement in international affairs”.
He cited as an example the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be sought over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is linked to what he believes is “an adequate, healthy view of Russia as not just a possible, integral participant in the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement is no longer going back, it's going to be a move forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's session, and I was very pleased to see that if one year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian view of what was taking place in the world, was largely uninterested, the situation was different,” said the Chairman of the Sufed Committee.
In his view, this is because “the so-called new liberal order, which is associated with the West, lacks answers to questions about how to address the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation and migration”.
“And the request for a Russian vision is becoming increasingly clear”, expressed Kosachev's confidence, stressing what he thought was “the present session was a good one for the Russian delegation's work, good for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that Idlib will not have to use military force in the Syrian province, as stated by Walid Mullem, Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic.
He said that Syria was entitled to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of withdrawal of fighters from the Russian-ban organization Jebhat Al-Nusr from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, saying “RIA Novosti”.
The Head of the Ministry also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military solutions to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in case Kurds sought separatism.
However, Muallem felt that negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they interrupted because of the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and President Regep Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by 15 October along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
It was previously reported that 37-year-old counsel had negotiated the transition to Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, referring to Mirror, former British captain John Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long served as a member of the London Club will lead a team no later than 23 years of age.
It's been noted that Terry's coach headquarters will replace Jody Morris who went to Derbie Cunty.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to a move to Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually he gave up this idea after talking to his family.
The first Vice-President of the Supreme Council, Irina Gerashenko, apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for “spioney” by Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushenko for his failure to release him from prison.
That was what she said in the video to the political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushenko FSB.
She said that during those days, there was an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, which had been hungry for the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them, are hungry and well-known people, supporting Oleg Senzov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you are.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, wherever the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities, all of us demand pressure on the Kremlin, pressure Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the politically imprisoned Kremlins and of the children who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbasa and Crimea,” said Herashenko.
It also expressed its confidence that the tests would kill every Ukrainian, making us “better, harder to protect Ukraine's national interests, protect each Ukrainian, understand what is good and what is evil”.
Recall that Ukrinform’s correspondent in France, Roman Sushenko, was arrested by Russian soldiers on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage by the Directorate General of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years of a high-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict legal.
Russian prison inmates granted the Ukrainian ' s last request before he was placed in a colony.
NASA reported approaching Earth with an asteroid the size of Big Ben
NASA, an American space agency, reported that a large SP1 asteroid could reach 160 metres in length.
According to Daily Express, a space object can exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or London wheel of vision.
The exact size of the data is not yet accurate.
The speed with which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between asteroid and Earth will be 3 October.
Then it will pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on September 19.
NASA has identified it as near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first video in history from the surface of an asteroid named Rügu.
Two Japanese rovers (planethods) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe were able to obtain unique footage.
The Porsium of the CMM-2018 football gas stadium was prescribed by Baste.
The damage of the football lawn at the Rostov-na-Dona stadium was linked to the concert of Russian rapper Vasili Vaculenko, or Basta.
Photo published in Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good at Basta and his work, but... sorry about the lawn," says the signature to the photos.
The comments state that the protective cover (special tile) affected the grass at the edge of the field.
The concert scheduled for 29 September was never cancelled.
The "Rost" Football Club, as well as the Russian Prime Minister, opposed the concert.
"I would like to know the names of those footballers and the representatives of the Resta, who claim that my statement could be detrimental, hindering the activities and development of the football club, and affecting the performance of its players," wrote Basta in response to criticism.
"Rost Arena" is one of the World Cups in the 2018s.
Five games of the tournament were held.

Vachtang Kikabidze on Cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they have managed oncology.
Sadly, sickness spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many who are ill.
The famous actor Wachtang Kikabidze admitted to living only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which was pronounced a sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit by a hammer from under the skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
We've been put in a hospital.
There was a bed that couldn't hold, stood there, fell all the time.
They started doing tests, they turned out to be bad cases, the artery doesn't skip blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big rotting cyst in my head, they had an emergency operation.
And in the course of the surgery, doctors saw the tumor behind the basket," told Kikabidze in One.
The tumor was vicious.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say good-bye to the idol at the door of his house.
But the actor’s wife did not allow a living actor to be buried, but she believed that she would be able to cope with the illness and that she would not leave her beloved mate’s bed for more than a year.
If it hadn't been for Irina, I wouldn't be alive now.
Always, when I had critical situations, she was like a rock," admitted the actor.
The actor was able to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the middle of Tbilisi.
And from time to time the rumours of his illness are about the untimely death that appears in the Network.
The creators of the website “Peacemaker” have introduced the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Cyarto, into the section “Physicity”.
The reason was “the attempt against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country has referred to “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiment in Ukraine”, as well as to “in the organization of provocation aimed at the massive violation of Ukrainian law by Ukrainian citizens”.
Note that Paul and a representative of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriotics) of Onufriy were accepted by the Deputy of Kiev-Pecher’s Lavra in front of Siarto at Chisilília.
The reason was their opposition to Tomos ’ receipt of the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpathia, President Peter Porosenko of Ukraine demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the sum of the "gold parachet" of the Voronez Zambberator
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of Voronez province, Yuri Aguillov, was made under the Regional Law on Public Offices.
At the same time, the real amount of the “gold parachet” released from office was somewhat less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the regional government press service.
According to the law, the salary for the post of Agilalova is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum was less than the income tax of 223,892 roubles than the 1 million roubles written by the media.
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His seniority is over nine years old.
This pension and one-time payment shall be made to him upon his resignation, and explained to the RIA News Agency in the Government of the Region.
At the same time, the payment of the Aguillau Supplement to the Pension Fund was suspended on appointment to the State and its salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
The Governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, won the election of Governor Vrio on 15 September.
Agilalova was dismissed on account of the expiration of the term of office of the Head of State.
The authority of other officials in public office in the region has similarly been completed.
On 29 September, Telegram Canal Nesigary published documents showing that Agilova, who had resigned from the post of Vice-Governor, had paid 23 salary termination benefits and that two days later he had received a similar post without a Vriot.
The State Secretary called on students to tell them about the harm of masturbation
Onishenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers were causing harmful information on the Internet.
This is at the educational level and at the family level, adding a deputy.
Hennadiy Onishenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in radio interview Guvorit Moscow):
As part of the overall sex education of children, this must be done by explaining the damage, because there is a risk of a child's sexual health, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturity of children is early enough and that large knives between their sexual maturity and the opportunity for formal contact between the sexes continue to appear.
In the opinion of Onishenko, the problem is being addressed by “hanjay”, “sexual silence” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is convinced that many youths are suffering from burnout.
The Deputat believes that training on the harm of masturbation is primarily available in schools in “hyper-urbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we're just not going to be understood, to say the least," said the professor.
Hennadiy Onishenko is a member of the RAMO Academy, a member of the RAM Bureau, a doctor of medical science, professor.
He is a well-deserved physician of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Bureau of the Russian General Society Organization of the League of National Health.
The families of the victims in Izmilawsk will help the Teplost.

As a result of the tragedy, several vehicles fell into asphalt and two young people died on the ground from the burns they received.
ANG became Germany’s second most popular
The German Alternatiwa Anti-Migrant has a new record of popularity, and Angelic Merkel's ratings are falling.
The Germans appeared to have begun to take seriously the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which had made the country a top target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most recently, the anti-immigrant party for Germany has become more popular and the positions of the ruling block of Merkel and Zeehofer have been weakened.
This week, ANG broke another record by raising a second line in the popular sympathy rating.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity have been able to bypass social democrats, who have about 16%.
The gap in one percentage point can be written down as a statistical error, but it must be noted that AdG, created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptists, has succeeded in becoming a major political force.
General leadership has so far continued to hold the ruling HCC/HDS cluster, which has a total of about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards loss of points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel block was four percentage points higher.
The German Chancellor's personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, the social democracies were followed by greens (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Alternatives evolution
The Allternative Party for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the “Alternative Choice 2013” group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group was initially in opposition to the Government ' s policy, but at the outset only dealt with economic issues, including Euro and EU cooperation.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's “conservation” of weak EU economies, without excluding the possibility of a return to the mark of Germany and the complete withdrawal of the country from the EU.
In the face of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of ANG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed part of a full-fledged party that had taken over the niche of Europeans and began to criticize the Government severely for its failure in immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ANG was able to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the “Alternatives for Germany” won a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who described Ukrainian citizens as “a new barbecue”
The lead political current on Ukrainian TV, author of two books by Ostap Drozdov live, admitted that he considered his countrymen to be “the cause of the Bols”.
They believe the TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and acceptance of texts since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, blaming him for not being patriotic and greedy.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Communication of the Independent State has begun to fight against literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism by Kiev authorities, prohibiting the importation of as many as 201 publications.
Manchester City won Briton and joined APL leaders
Manchester City played Brighton on his field at the 7th tour of the English championship game at 2:0.
The winners of the meeting were marked naked by Rahim Sterling and Sergio Aguéro, who had killed balls at 29 minutes and 65 minutes, respectively.

Canadians have built a car in the event of the Apocalypse magazine driving
Buy this car to anyone who wants it.
Rochael Defence Collections stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armor.
Rosel Senator APC APC Apolipsic Brone
It's not just video games, cinemas and book publishing that make money.
The new niche is now being exploited by automobile companies.
For example, Canada’s Rochael Defence Associations presented its armory of the APC Senate.
At no time from fantasy, the engineers of this company are building armoured vehicles for the police.
Rochel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable but are placed safely in a whole-scale armoured personnelkesule.
This bunker, or you won't call it, because its reservation level meets standard B7, is set on the chassis of a powerful pick-up truck, Ford Super Duty.
Its end, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule against grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The Salon of the Apocryce APC Apolipsis
To prevent passengers from even damaging an explosive wave from the wrecked machine, the car salon is equipped with special depreciative seats.
In addition, the pod has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe inspection, the Rochael Senator APC is equipped with a round-viewed camera with a night vision function as well as an armoured view tower on the roof.
There's no weapon in the car.
Front part of the armored apocryce of the Rosel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Rosel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodiese engine of 6.7 litres, all of which is transferred to four wheels of bronze through a 6-step automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting stuck in a full-blown apprentice of the Archel Senator APC.
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., in October will be possible to see the APC Apocrypha.
Name of death of the universe
The universe is still approximately 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world observed, about 13.8 billion years.
A study of an international team of scientists is presented at the ARXiv.org e-printer library and is being sent to the publication Publications of the Asian Society of Japan, reports Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
Experts have come to such conclusions by observing, with the help of a HSC (Centre Suprime-Cam) telescope, the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
After surveying the distribution of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the world ' s energy mass, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model  convened by the Cold Dark Matter, assessed the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the recording of data from the Planck European Space Telescope clarified the restrictions imposed on the StencilsCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the eventual death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments for the world to cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great divide.
There has been a failure to unify the sponsors of the pension referendum
The ability to learn the people's views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely.
On Saturday, Moscow held a meeting of the general initiative group of the referendum against the rise of retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different language of issues (the whole Centrosk has registered five language forms).
They decided to apply to the CIC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: “You want the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018 not to increase the age at which citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension?"
The language was registered by a Volho year-long sub-group, whose representatives did not participate in the congregation but were considered to be the most simple and legal issue.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and CPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups from Lower Novgorod, Voronez and Orenburg joined them.
Sviridov used to say “Kids” that invitations had been sent to all the initiators and some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, who is the leader of the Vold year-long subgroup (which was supported by another 15 subgroups), said, "Knowledges," that the invitations were not received and he didn't plan to come, "We didn't understand who the friend was and who the enemy was."
The pale singer Otis Rush died.
At 84 years of age, the famous Chicago blue guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, referring to his manager Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rash's creation has influenced musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was widely known in 1956 after the song "I Can't Quit You Baby" was released, which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B rating.
"Admiral" created big problems for us
Zinetula Bilaletdinov: "Admiral" created big problems for us.
The chief coach of "Aq Barsa" by Zinetula Bilaletdinov summarized the regular CWC championship game against "Admiral" (4:2).
"The hard game was complicated.
The rival fought with dignity, created big problems for us.
I'm glad we played pretty well today in most of the world.
I've already said that one day the legs will come, and it's important that we work on it.
And that we've won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaryp a break in this series?"
"We have our own program for which he works.
That's why this was the solution," says Blyletdeen's press service to the club.
Ilon Musk will leave the post of head of the Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will have to leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of chief executive director of the company, with reference to the regulator ' s data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Previously, the regulator filed a claim against Ilon Muska - officials believed that he had misled the Tesla investors because a businessman had allowed the purchase of all shares of the company at a high price - $420 for paper.
In Loko's "Amath" match, Turbin's mistakes came down like an abundance horn.
Former Allied Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the arbitrator Eugeni Turbin in the 9th tour of the Russian Lokomotive, Ahmat, and reviewed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Evgenia Turbin in Locomotive's match - Ahmat?
- I believe this arbitrator has confirmed that he is not prepared to judge a Russian premier.
I am surprised to learn that neither Turbin nor DFS leaders have come to serious conclusions about his poor qualifications in the fifth Spartacus-Dinamo.
The result did not delay in the ninth tour: errors in his actions, private passes of rough receptions were punctuated as if they were abundant.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's railways, he puts his hands in his fine area to protect Ahmada Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put on the barbeds.
- How do you judge the episode involving Idova, which was the 82nd minute when the ball appeared to be in his hand?
- I think there's been a deliberate game here by a lawyer's hand in his fine area.
The turbine was right next to the moment, and he saw the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This point was to be seen by Judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three disappeared, and the briefcases were not assigned.
So the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice has been damaged.
This was the very case where the judges were thought to have pushed out and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
At 52 minutes, Turbin refused to remove the attorney of Oleg Ivanov's guests, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
Should've been showing the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't really show up.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice, that some teams put the barbeds on for violations such as those in the Idova episode, and none of them.
What do you value as a football player?
- I don't know what to mean by double standards.
There was a raffle.
They didn't.
So the arbitrator doesn't give the second bar to the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's used.
And the second moment of double standards, that the judge is watching who's playing.
There's a Saturday Locomotive and Ahmad has serious claims for Turbin's work, because the team was slopped.
Matt Damon played the accused for rape with Judge Kavano at SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the New Year's Day Night Live broadcast on NBC.
In the course of a small Sketch, the actor played Kavano at the Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The candidate before the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed experiences during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh has repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but he has claimed that he never got drunk.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that he had been a virgin during those years.
Damon also lost those points.
I was just doing a lot of alcohol and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows it," the judge said in execution of Matt Damon.
Cavanano had been elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Strazend discovered in his cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streizand stated that the clones of her dead dog were acting quite differently from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
Indeed, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old cathode detulear dog named Samantha, who had to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog on the name of the miracle Milly, called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned at 49 times.
Experts clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so small.
U.S.A. considered Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States, they can start a maritime blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities have fought so hard to succeed in the world's hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
The possibility of a maritime blockade the day before was reported by Head Ryan Zinke of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior performed civilian functions rather than police functions, including natural resources policies.
Zinke ' s statement therefore came within the competence of his department, although it had not been deprived of political beauty.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that thanks to United States naval forces, maritime routes in the Middle East region were controlled and could be blocked if necessary.
From Zinke's point of view, the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continued to receive a large share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the revitalization of Moscow in the region, Zinke is confident.
The Minister made it clear that the United States still hopes to lead the world energy market, becoming the largest producer of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington would have to shake Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade on trade routes was an acceptable measure in that direction, according to Zinke.
The Colombian director received good feedback from the festival.
Our countryman, actor Eugenius Sangadjiev, and his film "Harmony" have been specifically referred to by members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "Divation" held in Omsk.
The festival diploma states that “it is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial film players”.
As we know, the picture of a young Colombian director was presented in a short film program called "Walk", which included eight films.
The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Ana is Ana the other way" -- the director's debut of the Yale Gladki actresses.

Russia has a club that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and collective England, John Terry, about why he visited the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartacus" - "Rosts" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm following.
It's been quite recently, and I was interested in looking at it from the outside.
I can't say that I am a painkiller because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have the sympathy for Spartacus and again want to apologize for the decision I made," says Terry's website of Chelsea fans.
Remember, "Rosts" with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartacus" was placed on the fifth line, with 15 points on it.
In the next round, the red and whites on 7 October will play with Enisey and the Trusted Valery Carpina will take Orenburg a day earlier.
The expensive violin was dropped into a Lombard for nothing.
When LBC Boutique and Loan had a Lombard in the town of Somerville, Massachusetts, a man brought a violin for an old and unprofitable tool, a whorebard offered only $50.
But Dylan McDermitt's experienced store manager suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and he sought advice from the expert.
Here it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano and is estimated at $250,000.
The violin stickers alone are estimated at $16 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had recently been stolen from a cityman and the instrument had been returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came into contact with the man who took it to the Lombard but is not followed by any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all who bring a violin to the Lombard will be asked to play on it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
During the ninth round of the RPF, we are faced with an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will take us to its stadium in Tushin “Rosts” under the leadership of Valery Carpin, a human being, as is known, not a foreign “people's team”.
A special feature of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of points, 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, behind the far-reaching Zenita and in one eye from the Krasnodar, who plays tomorrow with Dinamo.
The red and white are now a difficult strip: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, Massimo Carrera's team in the League of Europe suddenly flew into the "Rapida" and recently dropped into the homes of the Ahmadu.
Following the drby of the TCSA, which ended justly with no one, Spartacus, with a minimum count and not without difficulty played the Black Sea Cup, and it is too early to tell whether Russia's most popular club has come closer to getting out of the crisis.
"Rosts" three games in a row couldn't win, but the wounds didn't know five matches.
Let's see if Carpin can extend the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting with Spartacus in the Carpine "Rastov" ended in favour of the capital team.
It's 7:00 p.m.

The instincts of the Russian and German peoples are different, but few differences between them play a small role in understanding.
On International Translator's Day, 30 September, a professional synchronist, Berlin Sackse, spoke about this.
It has been involved in translations from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events in peace, "and the Russians, as the saying goes, "for a long time, let them drive."
But I don't think it's important for understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter," said the expert in the commentary on "RIA News."
According to the interpreter, to understand that the two countries were not without each other, "It's enough to know history."
And in the future, Sacks noted, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.

The chief coach of Vitiya Valery Belov is about the hit from Siberia (3:4) in the regular CWC championship match.
"Callega talked about Siberia fans, and I want to mention our fans," says White Official Web site Vitia.
"I hope they'll be supportive, too, because now almost every game is full of stadiums, a great atmosphere.
The game is probably the Lord's help today for Siberia, because it was very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
The whole micro game was lost, match 0:3 of our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to get that match out, even though there were moments.
But I'll blame you anyway.
Because you must have missed something in preparation.
It was another team compared to the last match."

The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice at "The Voice"
The viewers of Voice 60+ blame the mentor Leonid Agutin for "a bummer and glimmering."
When he heard his father’s voice, Nicholas Agutin, from his first note, in blind auditions, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the perpetrator.
But my son’s feelings took over, and he chose a relative as his team.
At that time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the mentor for his bias at the first stage.
But the thud has been prolonged, and the father of the star has taken the place of more worthy performers completely unjustifiably.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina for this injustice.
Yesterday, when we saw the show, we were disgusted by an indecent and outright twisting of our close relatives into the final staircase.
I've already doubted that Agutina's strength and conscience will not be carried to the end of his dad's place at all," as Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larina reasoned in the TV Man program.
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin had "saw" the beautiful performers who were really singing, while Nicholas Petrović whispered a moving song about his mother, explaining it because the audience still wanted to see his father's show.
But it turns out that's not the case, the viewers want an objective assessment, and they want to see really talented performers in the finals, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I'm sorry to the Golos from Agutin's team, they were doomed."
"In the last time, Agutin showed how he loved Dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and to leave his dad, who does not sing, whispers, how can I then call a mentor?"
"I like how much Dad sings, organize him a concert in Kremla for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's "The Voice", not "The Great Relatives."
"It was unskilled for Agutin's part."
"Then you have to propose on your own show that you speak to your dad, not on a show that's made for the money of the 1 Canal."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took a seat.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad has to make me understand more than any other participant with real visual data.
Why was a working man from Surguth with a beautiful voice and a timbre glistened, and Pope Agutin was brought to the finish?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and from screens for decades!
Because you will not break through the entwine!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's blond and cuisine.
And the family budget will not be too much!
The theatre is going on!"
The users also remembered that in one of the traditional "Golsa" seasons, the son of Gradsky came out on blind auditions.
At that time, three feet, and I didn't think I'd take my son to my own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, understand."
Agustin can't act as a professional.

The innovation will help those who choose to buy an apartment in a new building but who fear bankruptcy of the developer.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Amendments to the law on equity construction would require developers to lend their full credit to the bank.
And many experts have already talked about the possible heavy travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, things don't agree.
In the centre of Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw the money from the bank.
The incident took place in the evening of 29 September at Ivan Kudri Street, where capital law enforcement officials reported.
According to the victim, the stranger approached him and engaged in a conversation, but then suddenly he picked up a knife and demanded that he give him money and a cell phone.
Since there was no cash available to the victim, the stranger ordered that the money be taken from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 gruels and a telephone, he struck the victim and hid himself,” says the report.
Law enforcement officials were able to arrest the robber and turned out to be a 25-year-old kyivian.
He now faces up to seven years of imprisonment.
Police officers also follow up on the perpetrator's involvement in other such crimes.
Recall that on the eve of Odessa, there were several radical robberys by instabilators.
In one case, armed robbers were caught with the aid of a drone.
The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the RF on the Moon.
The Head of the Institute for Space Research of the Iran, Correspondent Member of the RNA Anatoly Petruković, presented the RIA News of a possible programme of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is now working on the direction of such work.
"There is not yet a consolidated view," stressed the scientist.
He noted that one option was the location of a low frequency radio telescope on the other side of the Moon, which would avoid interference with the Earth.
“It is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed for the exploration of space sources of radiation,” added Petrukovicz.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth’s satellite, according to a scientist.
This could help to determine how life occurs on the planet.
Formerly, the head of Roscosmos said that in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation could carry out a manned mission to the Moon by 2030.
Poor client dropped out the fecal basket at 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called having a tooth on the manager of a 7-Eleven network store 24 hours a week: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the afternoon, he entered the store and dropped it on the floor and on some of the items on the shelves containing the contents of the basket.
There were feces and urine in the basket that Simms "received" from a nearby mobile biotoilet.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was put in prison and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of property and criminal offences, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms appears more ridiculous than serious, the conviction may be quite severe, as he has repeatedly violated the law: large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of arms, driving in an inordinate state and animal abuse.

This is what U.S. Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.

In the view of the Minister, there are two options for its solution: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the first one, so pressure must be put on and Iranian energy must be out of use.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
The Russian pilot, Williams, Sergei Sirotkin, commented on the results of the Great Race in Russia.
I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and on the second turn, I ended up between two cars that hit me right away.
I lost all the positions that I played at the start, the moment, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we would get in the clear air and come back at the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus fighting with his partner, and he's in contact.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most uncarried track of the season, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful to be honest.
"I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA, "The News."
Remember, Sirotkin was in a race in the Grand Russia on the 18th, and he was the winner of the British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.

Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is to be foolish.
I'm completely disagreed with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the division of the team.
First of all, it's poems, it's possible to read and understand them as you like.
I wouldn't have responded if Carrera had been there.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to fuck up.
If they're swearing, that doesn't mean they've got something against the coach.
I think an Italian lacks flexibility in his perception of the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be unleashed at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at this together.
Spartacus doesn't have much to do with the different lines, and there's no limit to being young.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism to this match."
The game of the two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 1900 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartacus, led a youth team called Chelsea.
The teachers of Sirius discussed environmental technologies with scientists
Educators of the Syrius Education Centre in Sochi, at the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists at the National Research Centre of the Curchatov Institute.
The presentation of the researchers was part of the programme of the Global International Forum for Convergent and Environmentally Similar Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on behalf of the Russian Federation, on the website of the Educational Centre on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled “Koda Kurchatová”, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, a member of the correspondent Ran Mikhail Kowalchuk, described the global challenges as driving the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on Sirius.
Students have learned that modern technology requires enormous amounts of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
This problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will benefit from the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge benefit.
This is an explosive increase in medical technology, an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of living systems.
There's a negotiable side -- targeted intervention in human life.
There's always risks.
A car appeared -- people were dying under the wheels.
But cars still use it.
The dual nature of technology is immediate.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can produce weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions at the meeting.
The speakers were the PhD PhD candidate, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-natural technologies, the Curchatov Institute of Curchatova, Julia Diakov, and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-Technology Vyacheslav Demin.
Syrius Education Centre in Sochi has been established by the “Talant and Success” Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and continue professional support for gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the full-Russian online olimpiad for information security, Cybervisov, would be sent to Sirius for training.

Macedonia: The referendum was not held owing to a low appearance
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country “Northern Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The name was changed to the former Yugoslav Republic of Korea to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the appearances on the Sunday plebiscite “did not reach” to a constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to refuse to change their name.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, a supporter of the change of name of the Republic, stated that if more votes were “yes”, Macedonia would change the name despite the unreached quorum.

Kemerchan has made a herd of rams at the cemetery.
On September 30, on a well - known web site in Kemeros, it was reported by an eyewitness that cattle were free to walk around in one of the local cemeterys.
The animals ran between the fences and dug the grass.
The commentators expressed differing views: some local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of cattle at the cemetery, and their appetite could even help clear the territory from weeds and grass crops, but some of the citizens of the city did not experience the behaviour of the animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing to do with the rams.
The rams, of course, will not say that they steal, but that is not the case."
In any event, some eyewitnesses pointed out that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
What's the right thing to do?
The word doesn't exist.
That's right.
The word "push" in the sense of "drag, influence, influence" is only a phonetic because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "long."
We use that word to think it's from pressure.
But pressure and "to reach" emologically not only is not close, but even in some sense the opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
The share (church-book, dated) is “pleasant, complete, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy”.
Enjoying, enjoying is related words.
Previously, he had the meaning of “no matter what, have a self-resolved meaning” — “to the extent of yourself”.
The Old Slavic word "wire" is related to the word "rule" and "volunt."
The pressure, the pressure, is quite different.
In these words, the truly frightening "parents" are daos - "volk," deyja - "dead" and dvaid - "preserve."
A similar phonetic pattern of the words “pressage” and “long” as well as the latter's immeasurable aging caused them to enter the system.
So we have this very “d [a] volunt” that is used in letters through “a”, which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
So, right, I'm going to give it to you.
But that word is outdated, in its correct sense no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use pressure control, but remember it's office.

It really deserves a place in Formula One.

It will be interesting to watch his next year's interventions," says Alain SMP Raking.

Russia has protected itself from terrorists through an operation in Syria
During three years of Russian military operations in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was reported on in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the FAC, Victor Bondarev, Head of the Defence and Security Council Committee of the Federation.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-damaged devices: the air and space forces have carried out and continue to carry out all attacks precisely against terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
Russian air raids were used to break up the defenses of the Jihadists, which was a decisive contribution to the movement of Syrian government troops, transmitting the Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia itself to be protected from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including “Islamic State” (IG, banned in Russia) and “Jabhat en Nusru” (prohibited in Russia).
According to Henstaba of the Russian Armed Forces, some 4,000 Russian militants and about 5,000 citizens of post-Soviet countries were fighting on IG's side, passing on TASS.
This is only a case of listed persons, other than those who were not identified, but emphasized Bondarv.
Most of them have been trained and are ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports have given them the right to enter our country freely.
So, he said, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at far-off points -- otherwise, it would be “blowing towards us”.

These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.

The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria had almost been completed and the country had become safer and more stable.

According to Porosenko, as President, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are, whether in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the consul of that country from Berojvo.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says," said the President.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with Fascist actions
The head of the Synod Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, mythropolitan Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against the Jews.
"It's like in German Fascist Germany to stick a yellow spouting star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for this purpose that this bill was created," said the mitropolitan on the television channel "Russia-24" (Interfax quote).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainen conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to have full control over the SCP and to “suppose it out of the law”, a clergyman believes.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are the patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously become known that members of the Supreme Council are working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the name of the PCA of the Moscow patriarchate.
The Commander of the Pochavsky Lavra called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
Mr. Vladimir, Deputy of the St.
The text of his appeal to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (CPC) was published on Saturday on the site.
At various times in the history of our predecessors and relatives of faith and spirit, Christians had to practice their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats of the massacres that are spreading, it is evident that we too will have to survive,” said micropolita.
He asked for support, a prayeral, moral one.
Also, the laurel officer stressed that "your physical presence is likely to be appreciated."
The priest said, "Lenin's grandchildren are in the spirit, they threaten to be executed, and then we shall defend our sanctuary."
To whom the fate of Pochaev’s laurel, an Orthodox Ukrainian and universal shrine, is not indifferent, we must be prepared to protect it, and we must be prepared to do so.
Mithropolita urged against those who led the believers astray.
The PRC has a canonical status as defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and the friend of the Catholic pope of the Roman Bartholomew.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said the laurel's boss.
He recalled that, since October 1990, UPC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
"What else do we need?" said Mitropolitan Pochavsky Vladimir, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves, "Do other religions of Tomos have any independence from the Vatican?
Believers have been sort of able to figure out what kind of temple they're going to go to.
But someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some people envy themselves for sowing domes on temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The St. Petersburg Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Placed at the top of Pochaev’s Mountain, 70 kilometres from Turnopol.
The first historical record relates to the early 13th century.

In the presequence, teams did other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
"A motorist" is a good team.

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
Macedonia holds a referendum on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the name of the Republic of Macedonia on Sunday, 30 September.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by entering into an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
Nevertheless, Christian Mizkoski, leader of the leading opposition party, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (MMRO-DPMNE), stated that there would be no vote in the referendum.
As the Spokesperson of the Party, Nahum Stoilkowski, explained, Mizkoskii decided to abstain from voting in order to express his opposition to a treaty which considered it “hazardous”.
According to the Spokesperson, the current referendum decides on the country's name and no more, while the Party's strategic objective is to achieve NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, President George Ivanov of Macedonia also refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the country ' s name to be a negative factor.
“A new semi-Sovereign State with a new name is being created”, noted Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which is the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as the path to NATO and the EU, recalls the TCDC.

The United States of America is increasing the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was spoken of extensively in Tehran.
Multilateral consultations were held with Iran, China, India, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nicolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the fighters unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has been the record number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” noted Patrusov.
The scourges of Afghanistan did not begin yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) who had settled in Afghanistan.
Within a month, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
A multi-millionth of the United States contingent is still on Afghan land.
And peace is even more precious than it was then.
The U.S. troops are being chased to collect dozens of their bases.
As far as they can, they pay off the fighters for money, just don't touch them.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patrushev.
50 per cent is in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10 per cent is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they're growing up there fast.
The aim is to create a barbarous pseudo-halfate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be doing well.
It is also encouraging that over the 17 years of the United States presence, the production of drugs (polyats) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
The enormous growth of opium poppy-soiled areas and multi-billion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.
An agreement on the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, as it saw in that name an attempt at a single Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkowski, political scientist: "The blessing of this agreement of Macedonia or North Macedonia is the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will establish the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy.”
The reform of the country is led by the ruling social democracies, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Cvetín Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with him: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev has been imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision would have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose my sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crucible.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the Balkans but Europe as a whole.”
