President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law on administrative liability for violation of the time frame and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for State and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address very acute failure by employers to comply with their obligations in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
A further two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment under existing State and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to take on special control.
Because the businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfair employers who entered into unfunded contracts, they tried to avoid the obligations they had entered into and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the whole country.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, 4,500 officials have been prosecuted, 533 administrative officers have been brought to the investigative bodies for the conduct of the procedural reviews, and 46 of them have initiated criminal proceedings.
As a result, over 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
However, these enormous amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Baseline debts have resulted in numerous, systematic delays in payment of services to entrepreneurs by far more modest amounts.
This is a typical case.
The manager of the small company won a competition for social transport services for several million roubles.
Man has invested all his working capitals, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money in time.
The result is a growing financial casing of arrears in wages, taxes, loans that would result in bankruptcy if the employer did not seek assistance from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The problem has now been addressed in a number of regions as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of the year 2017, the total amount of public and municipal debt identified by prosecutors of the entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates in a manual anti-crisis management system.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations and measures to remedy them are dealt with in detail by prosecutors.
Such operational meetings have already taken place in Yaroslavl and Ekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ on the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences to establish administrative liability for the employer's officials for the violation of the length and manner of payment of goods, construction, services, and procurement for State and municipal needs, which was signed last week by the President of Russia, will be able to improve the payment of payment to public customers.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Attorney-General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article which provides for a fine of between 30,000 and 50,000 roubles for violation by an official of the order and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to enforce these legislative innovations in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit announced a warning of movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations has issued a warning to colour people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: “The warning to travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations, which is valid until 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travellers, visitors and the citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise greater caution in their State travels in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents recently reported throughout the State and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations, the recent Missouri law had led to the announcement of a travel warning that made it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims and that State law enforcement agencies were disproportionately selecting minority members.
“You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed,” said Rod Japel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, Canzas City Star.
“We hear complaints often, as never before.”
This is the first such warning given by the organization to the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during his trip to the state, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The prevention also mentions the recent report of the Missouri State Attorney General ' s Office that black drivers are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped on the road than whites.
“The aim of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri”, said Chepel.
“People have to be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money for bail or inform the relatives who travel throughout the state.”
According to recent data from the FBI's hate crime report programme, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes for 2015, making the State sixteenth in the State for such violations.
Prevention of movement is also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona following the adoption of new immigration laws, which had required local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which ACCU believed should have increased racially based checks.
Warnings on movement are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but social organizations have recently responded to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown shot a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, referring to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed during the shooting, and three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the perpetrators was detained, and the other managed to escape.
Russia supports the law on the lifting of free luggage for non-return flights
The Head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with the TV channel RBC that “encourageable” refers to the adoption of a law to abolish free shipments for non-return flights.
"We need to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage," he stressed (TASS quote).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that despite the fears of the citizens, there was no need to pay for the carriage of upper clothes and mobile phones in the pocket.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and to state it, to say it's to top clothes, to umbrellas, to mobile phones, to amidade or even to some computer have no relationship," said the head of Rossism.
In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law providing for airlines to exclude the provision for free shipments at a non-returnable airline ticket.
It is that airlines can determine for themselves the number of seats and the weights of the luggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the elimination of Baikal's pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake had been subjected to extreme pollution.
It mandated the identification of funding sources, plans and actors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned the full re-establishment of contaminated territories.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out,” quotes the President’s RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney General of Russia should conduct a test to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with regard to the occurrence of natural landfills and a number of environmental irregularities by recreational managers.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything in a row to be checked, but the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and measures to be taken”, he stressed.
The Office of the Attorney-General had previously reported a decline in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites under environmental supervision.
Recall that, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, on a direct line, stated that legislation needed to be amended to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of economic problems by residents of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal Water Area, but in the Government of Buryatia, it was recalled that such a change was insufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
In the past, the Ministry of Economy had proposed a solution by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
A new temple will appear in the south.
In the village of Sosová, members of the community of the indigenous small peoples of the North, Rakhtanya, along with the inhabitants of the Berezov region, participate in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honor of the clergyman, Nicolas the Clergy.
Its location is the riverbank, and the temple will be seen from afar, so it will serve as a guide light for fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will end this year, the domes are now installed, and church bells are available.
The fleet's I.O.B.A. has been escorted by transport.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas's miraclemaker because he is honored by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the Soyna, however, fishing provides the settlers with work, feeding them.
The local people are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it in their school essays as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang in an open-air snack.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while smoking carefully stores in an iron box taken from his office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, which is a hundred feet [100 m] away, and throws the bulls there.
A fine for garbage in public - $500 local, says Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just had a reflex. You can't leave a candy fountain on a bridge, you can't just step on it.
And now there's video cameras all over the place.
And indeed, Singapore’s pavements are clean in the center of the city, like a museum.
Chang tells us three months ago his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to corruption.
What?
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the enormously harsh laws, the AIF columnist is on the ground.
No one's thinking of abolishing the death penalty here, as Victor Lee Hong explains.
And the government has long been concerned about both the EU and the United States.
If a person imports a large batch of drugs or sells them, he's placed in a row.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
His defence was addressed by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even by the pope of Rome.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
After that, the drug couriers of our country make an effort to cross the country.
The point is that Singapore has established that laws are subject to the universal obligation to comply with everything, not just the humble and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, the millionaire, the vice-premier, the famous artist, or the European Union resident.
There's one option here: if you find a cocaine dump, you'll be hanged.
When you walk through Singapore and you meet a bunch of warnings, you are surprised to see how many prohibitions there are in this city-state!
For example, a chewing rubber is only sold in a drug kit, and it can be bought strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!).
The visitor will not be taken by gum when he arrives, but he should attach a "slice" to the subway, and he will be fined 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white tablets on their necks, "I've been garbage."
In addition to fines, abandoned urns of urns are often sentenced to "seal in palaces" for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6,000 roubles are paid by the criminal who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, while in an attempt to deal with a small need for an elevator in a residential house, a special detector works, locks the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public execution of songs, and even the excessive flooding of room plants (!): The water supply is believed to attract mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the metro, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
In general, the thought comes to mind: no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
That's not how it's trying to turn me into Mohammed Kabir-Cajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years I have not seen anyone be attracted for their violation.
Why are they preserved?
So citizens don't relax.
Compliance with basic rules is closely monitored.
Let's say that if a minor is sold in a cigarette stand, it'll be punished along the chain: the shop owner will pay a huge sum, the violator himself will be hit by sticks at the back, and the seller will also be thrown out and put in prison.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
Back in the '70s, we had road chaos -- motorists ignored sweaters, drove whatever they wanted, drive drunks.
After the fines were imposed in one year, everything calmed down.
The driver now knows that if he stops, the police will not be released for bribes, imposes a fine of the value of the apartment, and will be sent to jail for years.
Many foreigners view the city-state in South-East Asia as a concentration camp.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson described Singapore as “Disneyland with the death penalty”, a visitor from the United States who had brought terror to the general wealth of the inhabitants, “a frightening clean airport” and “a culture of culture”.
Such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're truly afraid to throw a bump on the sidewalk, are caught when you're on the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and then suddenly you're breaking the pattern, and the bus stop is full of plastic cups.
"How's that?" You're surprised.
Here we go, the Singaporeans are laughing.
Everything happens.
Not every such crime will be seized in its place, but you must know that if you are counted, you will not be reviled. You have broken the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore's power is completely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, I moved very carefully — motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the middle of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
We don't all try to throw garbage into the urns on our streets either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth through the recruitment of dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You're gonna think about it.
It's human nature: remember, in Russia no one was wearing a wheel until they were fined.
Although Singapore was not the main source of fines, it was voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that in Russia, people would be happy to have clean streets, lack of trash on the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who mix the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment. Thank you.
On the other hand, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking after.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House targets Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when it starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no less than the rest of us -- hence, the deliberate stage demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Fairdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic stamp on the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with journalist CNN Jim Akosto about the President's proposals to dramatically reduce legal migration.
We'll be honest, Miller didn't try on the statue itself.
A crowd of recreational shipowners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the conclusion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller shouted at Acoste, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enshrines the world.
The constitution you are talking about was later added and does not form part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller correctly explained the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It is about the present news of Lazarus, the only ones in whom the State invites not all immigrants but the poorest: 'Yours are the poor, your poor,' 'your multitudes, who hope to breathe freely,' / 'Unhappious deviations of your smug shores.'
Never before have "inhabitable discards" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that in America these people don't expect Trump.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to put her words on a statue after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a totally political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and the American republics by means of a banal classic figure, the female form of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she was given a very different name: Mother of the Emancipated.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist movement and a devastating attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right thing to do is to change it back.
Rush Limbo, a certain John the Baptist who witnessed Trump's arrival, reasoned in 2010 that freedom does not invite anyone; rather, it is an early neo-conservatory, whose flames are lying in the darkness of America: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
You don't need a torch to light your way to the U.S.."
Against Limbo's custom, it's really got to point.
The idea of the statue depends solely on the angle of the eye.
Lazarus ’ great creative achievement was to see her as she would have been seen by the exhausted, unhappy but full of hope on the ship’s decks after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and the prospect of a better life.
Her statue responds to the hopes and hospitality they long to hear.
And of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to fuel the hatred that is the only source of their strength.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the British team.
Alyd Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scots in Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the game of the U.K. Federation, said that the 16-person Scottish part of the World Championship would make a “significant contribution to the game of the team”.
The record number of Scottish lighthouses was selected at the London Championship, which began on Friday, 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special” and in the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain must take this into account.
'We know it, and we're trying to understand it and we're going to support it while they have the capacity,' said Blake.
"I talked to people at Scotland's Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Fed of Light Athletics thinks that what they've done has to be done.
The British Fed of Light Athletics: What they did must work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things happened, but it's quite brilliant."
Some of Scotland's light athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Ailed Doyle chose his captain.
"Ilyd is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"A lot of babies, whether Scotsmen or not, and from where they live or are trained, have come out of this room, feeling proud and eager to win.
The passions and sincere feelings that Aileen had in her were excellent."
The owner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, who, at his fifth World Championship, will run 400 metres in an obstacle, says that 16 Scots in the British prefabricated are "unbelievable."
The previous record of Scots in the World Championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir is on his way, specializing in the middle run and beating five British and two European records last year.
She'll run for 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hair, who's going to be in the race for 1,500 meters, is another Scotsman who's worth noting: behind his back is a good season, in which there were winners at British assembly competitions and annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first championship of the world when she was the only Scotchman on her team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she's "unbelievably proud" because so many of her compatriots not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the finals.
"The Captain is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, it's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all Scotsmen who have entered the assembly.
This shows how much we have done.
And they are all light-years-olds who are going to try to get on a pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to welcome home the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere will be great."
Locking criticisms on Facebook: You don't have to go to public office if you're not ready to listen to voters' critics' criticisms.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from critical him of everything from internal politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Maybe we, the deaf and the dumb, will be led as sheep into slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and wiped out posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his Facebook official page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The subordinate governors called this action null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "not and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan-like guy.
He's an amazingly popular republican governor in a democratic state.
He's second in the approval rating for the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionor.
He demonstrated a firm hand in state administration and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communication with his voters and with jokes, showing his baldness after chemotherapy his head on his page.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block the people who come to the Governor's page -- declared to be an official public forum and administered by the administration on the money of taxpayers.
In an interview with Washington Post, the Spokesperson of Amélia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply a modernization of them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spams, and gamers that abuse the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of Hogan's real people.
And these are the real people, not trolls -- a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who appeals to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible as an appeal to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lakshmy Sarma Ramán of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in her comments to the Post article.
“I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some people immediately say it's the so-called round, instead of recognizing that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the subordinate governors call a “concentrated spam”, others would probably call “active life position”.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or putting away negative comments.
It's much less drinking work than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical fronts, or arresting and closing their mouths to the protestors.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in the number.
Hogan is not the first official criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were forgotten on his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. district judge James C. Kacheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Laudon County Monitoring Board violated the First Amendment by putting the voter out of his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed claims with the American Civil Liberties Alliance for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so hard.
In Washington, D.C., an era of affordable postal spending was about the same as today's Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his credibility.
And even then Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms of Juricos, Valeryus, Belizeus, and Porsius wrote letters to newspapers deriding Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online document project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means consenting to it.
Ronne Raffertty hopes for household comforts at Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronne Rafferty, hopes for home convenience for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A North Irish native who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links was on his way to the final round last year, until he lost Paul Ilsa, attached to a new seat and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and director of the Club.
“I have seen the Renaissance Club being built, and we have seen it come to a successful conclusion with this event,” said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job doing this place.
He's a bright believer in this game and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to the opportunity for the first time to stand for the championship title, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career both in the European Tournament and in the European Challenge Tournament Tor.
“It's a really special feeling,” said a Southport player.
“I couldn't try to win "Extremada Open" again because it was removed one year after I won it.
Getting back to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
He returns to battle on Gary Orr's native land, who joined the European Senior Sports Tournament after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be the first on the public in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Satellite Open.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed you a good golf.
I am pleased with the way things are done so far.”
The former winner of the Masters tour will join the trio and the champions of the senior athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former "Ryder Cup" Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the field; the others are Andrew OldCorn, Stephen Macalister, Bill Longmuier and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 per hour if one person is in the car, and £10 per person is two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads are learning how to absorb harmful emissions
There is already a test on Britain’s roads in tunnels that can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by motor vehicles.
The country's transport agency reported positive results from a 100-metre tunnel set on a highway in the north, according to Autocar.
A tunnel six metres high is built of some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the establishment of a network of such tunnels is only part of the major measures that the British authorities intend to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English are going to expand the network of charge stations for electric vehicles, undertake a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial electric transport and upgrade heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgord changed the punishment of a disabled mother for a fine
Mosgorud changed the sentence of four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
TASS reports on this.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the term with conditional, explaining its request that Mother's disease “dissolves him from being found in prison”.
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving a sentence in a general regime colony for a robbery whose victim was a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a retreat in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian golden land
In preparing dinner, Bardin Degay doesn't use the stove.
She doesn't even use it hard enough.
At her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply puts sweet potatoes, which is called note, right at the spot.
After half an hour, the nested tubers are packed and eaten with eager, unwashed hands.
Degay's sitting on the ground floor--she doesn't have furniture-- and that's where she's doing her work in the house, like a strip of muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of four wives of her husband, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
There's so many people here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous — many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and some are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk through the village after five o'clock," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which joined Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The current movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strong control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarothali is as remote as a abandoned city; the road here includes an 18-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, Nairobi, and then a five-hour push on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
A city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted with rust in a variety of reds.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of them.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the papuas, the Me Pagos, worshiped a god named Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“We used to wear these clothes,” Degay says, pointing to our bright, handcuffed turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, belonging to the Feynix Freport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freport obtained gold and copper for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves estimated at $78 billion.
These assets, however, have led to one disaster for the papuas, guaranteeing that Indonesia ' s powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation in The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Fre Report paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres of the indigenous people of Papua in the seventieth years could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protestors in the region.
“We will lose everything”, the report published in 2016 by the British diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent, as stated in another report, rape and electric shocks – and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It's hard to estimate the number of casualties because there's been accidents every week,” says Andreas Harrison, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyanans had been prolonged, as Papua ' s resources had attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million inhabitants are 83 per cent Christians, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from densely populated Indonesian islands — Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan benches, “varungs” sell a roasted chicken and a mixture of hado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The local people are trying to stand up to competition.
“The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papuans”, explains Abet Yow, a 20-year-old Paniai woman who had moved to Jayapur, provincial administrative centre, because of her work.
“That's why the indigenous people of Papua, the mother (women) of Papua, lost their market.”
The Indonesian President, Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to engage in inequality and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On its way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and the local people feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, hoping that he will fulfill our hopes for justice,” says Joo.
In fact, just two months after October’s inauguration, Jokovi Paniai suffered a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas giants at Enarothal, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle came out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one soldier was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Amo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government Electoral Commission building, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Pakistani men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual bow hunters and filled the White Way, the papaasian dance of the paego tribe, running in circles and picturing a bird's song.
Some protestors started putting stones at the police station and at the military base.
When the situation set in, the internal radio service soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, as alleged in an official document that was seen by TIME correspondents but was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayama, head of the Koto district in Enarotal, felt threatened and called for calm, asking the crowd to move around.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I returned, a bullet hit my left wrist,” he told the magazine TIME, standing on the wings of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaime still doesn't know who shot, but says the bullet came from the chauffeur of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he added.
A local resident of Alphaeus, Yowa, was caught three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Yohanes, a grim story, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papuan Police, told reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because it had been attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us”, said Papua Commissioner Pubejo Sulistio, a police representative in 2015.
“It's a matter of life and death”.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and much more injured.
News of the murders only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later Jokovi delivered a talk in Jayapur expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be addressed immediately so that it will never occur again in the future”, he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security of Wiranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them occurred in the ninety or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is, of course, that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to be followed,” he said.
Viranto then gave up his words by speaking with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, ‘It will be decided by judgment.’
Viranto, who was accused of “crimes against humanity” by the United Nations of more than 1,000 people killed during the bloody ballot for East Timor's independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai faced similar statements with a grim mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been no change,” says Yohanes.
I'm tired.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I am afraid that I will be arrested by the military, and I fear I will be shot.”
His brother Jacob also felt that the Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in a neighboring Paniai district of Diyay.
In a clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old, Ravianus Dove, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the construction site belonging to the company.
According to police officers, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) began shooting at a crowd and killing one person.
“We were in such panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” reported TIMO, a 20-year-old, Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and sees the wounded moving swiftly.
“I hid at my house for two days.”
The Diyay Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
The singing has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is a source of frustration for the Mee, Moni, Danes and Damal tribe, scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for Freedom of Papua (OPM), an insurgency army that claims to protect the rights of papuas by organizing sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and unjustly detained by the military under the pretext of “Protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the people of Papua Panai, it is considered “a good place to be forgotten”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for local residents.
Bread is not available to the same degree.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of their crops for the family and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten tubers stand for only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have increased between indigenous papuas and new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights at Nairobi airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually more educated and wealthy migrants.
The popes rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain bitter.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquiudi and Basil Longchan were deported from Papua for “the lack of coherence with the organizations concerned”, despite the fact that they were rarely granted permission to conduct a video.
According to Félim Kine, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokovi's election campaign to lift restrictions on the media to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“For the time being, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa refusal and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramant Nassir, retracted the statement by the group, informing journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
The local population wants more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiyse Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the locals broke the silence by praying: “We want freedom”, as the source, who also attended the meeting, wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the parrots say it's unlikely to vote again for Jokovi.
“Jokovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Panai shooting”, says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the Panai people, in addition to living in the shadow of the threats of the Albanian army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobai says that Paniai, like other papuas, consider their voice given to Jokovi as a debt that he should pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family”, says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else were we to do?"
The second fire covers the Dubai skyscraper, Fakel.
The fire swept over one of the world’s highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 70th - story structure at 337 metres high.
This is the second fire that has swept through a towering building – which is, by coincidence, called "Fakel" — in two years.
The building had been evacuated, no casualties had been reported, and there had been no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from a fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” told Reuters of a skyscraper named George.
According to the Civil Defence Department in Dubai, fire brigades extinguished fire at about 4:00 local time (00 a.m. in Greenwich) and cooled down the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The accident could bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in the outdoors of towering buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Facela administration after the fire in 2015 found that the most affected was the cry — the outer panels used to shape and isolate them.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the crying panels of the Grenfell Tower Building in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of the Ida Virumaa tourist flow was minimal in June
A total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, 125 persons or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period of the year, are reported to have benefited from the data provided by the correspondent for the rus.err.ee portal in the Statistics Department in June 2017.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and foreign tourists have increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist trade increased by 7.3 per cent (544) in June to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased by 8.9 per cent or 318 more markedly than in June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 RF guests were staying at Ida Virumaa Hotels.
Andrei Malaoh made it clear to worshipers who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakov hinted his fans at Instagram who was responsible for his departure from the First Channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has placed a piece of news article in the August 1 issue of The News.
The Malakov photo was signed as "the milk boss" tag.
The article on how to prevent a worker's “burning” and to pay attention to his condition.
If you recall a lot of reports that the lead was unable to find a common language with a newly arrived producer who started reformating "The Pure Says," it becomes clear what he's so transparently hinting at, writes "CP".
It was reported that Andrew Malakov, the teleleader, was currently on leave and had not signed an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The dismissal situation could be clarified in the coming days.
Five military personnel were killed in Afghanistan when the vehicle exploded
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting the RIA News.
According to police reports, a mined car exploded the night before next to a military roadblock in the district of Girishk.
Twenty dead are known.
On Friday morning, there was a new CP in Hirice.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Dyver made a video of a biting shark of his camera.
Dyver and researcher Greg Scomal made a video of a shark that bit him GoPro's exchen camera.
Rolic put on Facebook a unit of the United States Agency for Maritime Fisheries in Massachusetts, of which Somal is a staff member.
The incident took place on 2 August off the Cape Cod coast in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to remove the shark on a camera held on a special stick during underwater navigation.
When a man was noticed, an animal over two feet [3 m] long came near him.
Shark tried to bite a camera without trying to attack a scientist.
The Commissary explained that the predator had done the same to determine if he was comfortable.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that this kind of behavior of the marine animal proved to be new to scientists.
The cause of mass fighting in the Ural military centre has become known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region arrived at the Allan Training Centre, where a mass fighting took place, to investigate the incident.
Some of the details of this defeat are already known.
According to the Musk library on the Wkontakte page, the contractors of the Ural military unit No. 316112 were severely beaten because of an untied bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan had demonstrated his disregard for an officer's order to fill up the topping sheets.
The officers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young men were hit by glass in the barracks of beds and sinks.
More than a dozen people were injured in the mass fight.
Information about the sex was denied at the CWD.
The study found that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited items onto the aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board aircraft through United States Transport Security Administration inspection sites, including at least 6 per cent of them on board aircraft, unsupervised with prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and involving more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate regulations.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to fly with something prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were millinals compared to less than 15 per cent of members of Generation X.
Food and water are most commonly served by the ATB staff consciously.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having carried sharp items through the search, while 2.2 per cent of women respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried illicit drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport searches and how many had deliberately done so.
Most often, it is expected, whether consciously or unconsciously, that smuggling is carried out through the search by those who fly most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry or in what quantity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB picks up are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered prohibited from passing a book.
Liquidity is allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt abandons the intention to postpone implementation of Obama ' s emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's regulations aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants and causing them to become educational.
Pruitt explained that his agency was now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around 1 October, by which states should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay their compliance by one year in order to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “continuity with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before President Trump was appointed to his current position, was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of the tightening of environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, D.C., the regulations opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry were repeatedly blocked or postponed.
An unexpected change of course to Wednesday is another legal defeat of the Püitt ' s return course.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington held that the Head of EPA had exceeded its authority to try to postpone the implementation of the Obama Administration ' s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by cutting back on ozone standards, he simply met the obligation of EPA to cooperate with states in the integrated process of implementing new standards in a timely manner.
“In previous EPA administrations, often failed to meet the target date, after which he waited for claims from groups of activists and others and discussed the timing of the settlement of the case”, said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
“We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take the time frame seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the authority it gives us.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use his “authority to defer and other powers specified by law” to make sure that the rules of “jyjdfys” are on a clear course and on all available information.
The Republicans in Congress insisted on a broader revision of the ozone-related rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this subject.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that had filed a suit against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue with legal pressure.
"The change in EPA -- after our claims -- is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the power to cover their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the suit.
Ozone at earth level occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and other sources enter the atmosphere with sunlight.
A person who has been able to do so can cause serious respiratory problems for people who are sensitive to it, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in Prüitt's course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person who's responsible for protecting the air we're breathing," said Laurie Ann Byrd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of Trump Administration and protect those who pollute the air and their particular interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russia Fediction of Light Athletics
The Congress of IAAF voted in favour of the extension of the exclusion of the All-Russia Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Rehabilitation Council of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that suspension be maintained.
The extension of the suspension was voted upon by 166 persons, against 21, and transmitted by TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA has made significant progress towards meeting the conditions established by the membership restoration board, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualification of WFLA at the London Peace Championship, Russian light systems were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team was composed of 19 persons admitted to IAAF originals.
The WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
A report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent expert, Dick Punda, was published on numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For details on the last report of the IAAF Council, see IAAF has extended the WFLA sanctions.
Both defeats
Within the framework of Russia's TFL 3 lore, the newoskovic Chemik team conducted an anti-Caluga FK game.
A little over a decade ago, the rivals played with each other in a Russian cup, but this time the painting of the game was completely different.
Chemist didn't give up on the opponent, but a second relaxing at the end of the match led to an offended naked and fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the Weavers with 0:3 accounts, many of them foretold a simple victory for their masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Newfounders have forced themselves to act with defence, but with force.
In the first half of the time, they built more and had the advantage of owning a ball.
Alexei Sirotin, another very high-quality match, repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and gave the partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, the attack on Chemika lacked effort and luck to put the Kalugi defense at a halt and kill the first goal on the exit.
After a break, the game began to run on counter-learning courses.
Newfounders are more actively involved in the attack.
A disturbing call for our team was the defense errors that allowed the countrymen to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemik took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the colleagues' experience has played their part -- they've had a more informed and cold-blooded ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemick transferred the ball to the corner, whose pitching of the master's fields was transferred to the gate without resistance.
Yuri Dubrovin was the author of the nude.
In the reporting meeting, Chemik showed us a good game, but suffered an injury.
Our team is awaiting another departure, on August 11, 19th, in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium named Edward Stretz, the newcomers will fight with the court of the Centr group "Ararat", which is composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmilalov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebco.
Come and support the Chemist!
Place and time of the meeting of the newcomers: 6.30 p.m. near the Magnília store (East, D.2, Corp.
Chemika: Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romashenko, Shayunov, Khomtov, Goghia (Oreshkin), Douddati, Reds, Saints, Belians (Adenows), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to published telephone transcripts, Trump pressted Mexico for payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published the telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone call with the President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nieta Trump, insisted that he stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. President argued for publicly speaking against the wall, and according to the news, he was told, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump started his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia was also found in a published decryption.
Trump told Ternbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees on their way to Australia was “smart”, “disgusting” and “thud” and insisted that because of an agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by saying to Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day”.
The bodies of the martyrs in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, which is carrying the bodies of Russian victims in Abkhazia, took off at 8:15 a.m. Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, and transmitted TASS.
At the destination of the end point, the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the mayor of the city, will meet and briefed the journalists by the Deputy Minister of Kurorts and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba.
In the past, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic stated that all expenses incurred by the Government of Abkhazia in bringing the bodies back to Russia.
In addition, official Sukhumi intends to compensate the families of the victims in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Aqba, the Abkhaz leadership has expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the bombings to fly and live in the Republic, but relatives have only entrusted the Republic with the right of local authorities to act in accordance with established procedures.
On 2 August, at around 4:20 a.m. Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the town of the Primor Gudaut District at the missile and artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defence, after which large-scale missiles and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, the storage room was set fire, which caused uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
The CP resulted in the death of two Russian citizens, Elena Polakov, born in 1970 and Elena Timofeev, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a water source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to the health facilities of the Republic with injuries of various degrees.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest being discharged.
Studying Russian influence on American elections will take place by a large jury.
Robert Müller, Russia’s Special Prosecutor, has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., which will examine Russia’s influence on the election of U.S. President in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected material will examine the Special Prosecutor ' s Office and decide whether they are sufficient for prosecution.
The convening of a large jury gives Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury's investigation, which started work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting, then, of the candidate for President Donald Trump's appointment with Russian lawyer Natalie Weselnitzka.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Müller himself promised to do so.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Junior had expanded his legal profession.
Tramp Jr. said earlier that he had been waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of the Departement of Hillary Clinton candidate, but that no documents were presented, and that they were eventually adopted.
In early August, a number of media sources reported that Trumpa, Jr., ' s announcement of a meeting with Vesselica, had been literally influenced by the Trump Senior.
In the White House, it was clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice Mayor Pensa was detained in the workplace
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Pensa, Irin Chirsin, was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigation Committee in his workplace, and informed RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the UK SS press has assured them that they will soon follow.
At Pensa Mayor's office, there's no comment yet.
Irina Chirshin is one of the five deputy heads of administration of Penza.
It has been responsible for urban and land affairs since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had served as head of the State Department of the Pensen State Inspectorate for a long time.
Irina Chischin is raising three minors, and it is noteworthy that she was again a mother a year ago, refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no launch vehicles or launch vehicles.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's budget is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike Soviet monuments that have been destroyed in some countries, Gagarin's monuments are, on the contrary, “sucking around the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was installed in Houston, U.S.A., near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
A monument in Carlsov Varah, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city centre to a square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument appeared in Riga.
That's how the first cosmonaut's name sounds, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Killing Morse Ford: activists lose Lynch Courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Mercuri, 1948, passed by the audience in Monroe village in Georgia, and raced to the small Morse Ford bridge with a roar.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
A middle-aged male dressed in a thin striped suit, stretched over a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screeching howls broke the silence when a young black man was dragged out of his front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which broke out on July 22, is just an engagement.
But when the Rogers neck was hit by a loop, almost all the viewers hid their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night in 1946 when two black couples, Roger and Dorota Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynching.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that during all these years no one has been arrested -- although we see them with us -- although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a mark on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress who's been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, a play is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we have justice."
The coroner covers the common body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI reports received by EBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one was charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that they have always known the city well for two related motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling first allowed black citizens to vote on the praimaries to be held that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, a black user named Roger Malcolm was hit by a knife in a fight by Barnett Hester, a white landowner who appeared to be a woman.
Brooks says that according to the rumours of the city, Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorota's wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorota and their cousin May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and came to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilanteists surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison," one of the FBI reports.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only participated in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he said.
"They were all killed to send a signal to black people in town: if you register and vote, you'll have the same thing with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green manages an annual play reproducing the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, captures the viewer and tells of a deep racism that many would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks it's important.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build relationships with you unless you hear me or hear that I've survived."
This year's performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the other blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to a year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been the main member of the clan for several years, but he says the role hasn't been easier.
"I think I'm scared because it's not that person that I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
The actors Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectrum begins with Malcolm screaming and pushing him, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorota.
"I said, Neck, get out of my house!"
Shouting Deacon in reply.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are broken by a homophobic.
Green laughs louder than everyone else.
"What's this" asks Ascon.
He is concerned and confused.
Am I winning?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think whites used to say leg."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You're supposed to produce a solid 'p'."
And the energy changes in the room: discomfort changes with a sense of companionship.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for a play, but also for the memory of the four dead.
The scene starts first.
This time, when the word "H" is spoken, it becomes clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The spectrum ends cruelly and quickly.
Crying, shooting, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and plays Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat out of their eyes.
Almost equal numbers of blacks and whites are present.
One couple came from Aida, New York, to see the performance; many live close together.
They spent almost eight hours with Georgia's heavy spirit while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm's and Dorsey's graves.
Until then, the killing has remained only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are hanging in the air right now.
When the last note of the song is quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children bend towards their heads, touch the blood-forming paint and the fixed bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," said one little boy, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll-clan.
Nick Rascon hugs two other actors and suddenly weeps into their arms — the emotional load of the play finally hit him.
"All right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had a reason to do so."
Later, the audience goes to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are vivaciously discussing a performance with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinsky is struggling to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to those terrible, terrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "but now it's called what's shooting the police."
In another corner of the room, Tyrón Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, was the general focus of his attention.
He said he was already planning next year's presentation.
"The stopover is encouraging because it not only describes the horrors of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
The court fined Navlovov for violations on an “agitarian Saturday”
The Simono Court of Moscow fined Alexei Nvilovi 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the meeting.
The oppositioner was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation.
In the past, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hiszir Musakaev, concluded the administrative case in respect of Leonid Volkov, the head of staff of the opposition, Alexei Navlovov, who was held accountable under the same article as Navali.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday” conducted by supporters of Navlova in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Upon seeing the agitatives following the participants on the Saturday, the police considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately hidden its true nature, a public action (which required prior request from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazouev requested an end to administrative proceedings due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain shortcomings in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov's “agitation Saturday” was not detained, but he received a summons requiring him to appear at the police station to tell of an event he was actively involved in.
The same agendas were given to Navlal and another associate of the opposition - Nicolai Laskin.
Mordovia arrested a bride and three wedding guests
The Mordovia court arrested a local resident who had shot four people, including a bride, at a wedding.
This was reported to the Office of the Investigation Committee in the Republic.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the argument, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot at visitors several times at events that had come to the village pond.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (“Huliganism”), article 30 (3) and article 105, paragraph (a), (e), (and) of the Criminal Code (“Trying to murder two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner for hooliganic reasons”).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened the shooting because the guests of the wedding decided to take a bath and had passed through his section to the water.
Minenergo will tighten demands on turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules on the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, such as turbines for power plants.
In launching gas turbines, gas turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production, equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access to it with Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The Government's draft ruling is ready and has been submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document include information and access to site management by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfair partners and hackers.
The EU has expanded its anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The European Union Press Service stated on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded owing to a scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines in Crimea.
This was previously reported by the Week's Arguments.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded owing to a scandal with Siemens production turbines, which had allegedly been delivered to Crimea in the absence of sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries to expand the anti-Russia sanctions.
It had previously been reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the current day, and that was the decision, the sanctions against Russia had been expanded.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the preliminary dividends by 72 per cent by the beginning of another restructuring programme aimed at dealing with the problems faced by their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon, head of company, will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to reduce costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost-reduction programme to try to get back to life a business that had been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
A company that agreed last month to sell its share in the publication Penguin Random House to its partner, the Burtelsman brand, said that its projections for a year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in sales of basic goods in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier died as a result of a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as reported by NATO.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the Karabah town area.
This explosion is the last of the devastation that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the Thursday evening explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by “a man-borne improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded were reportedly in a stable state and received treatment at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents report that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as “Islamic State” (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb in a car caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had launched an attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed in the centre of the city, the most serious terrorist attacks in the country since the United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence has stressed the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States estimates whether the United States military force needs to be increased to assist troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its line of conduct and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency for the Post-Court Claims cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Agency for the Environment has reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Act that states should limit air pollution emissions one day after 15 states have sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone 2015 measurements, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and sensitivity to our partners in the states”, said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone measurements of ozone, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia filed an action claiming that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to push back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at brilliant economic growth, according to Trump.
But actions in this direction have generated resistance from democracies and natural law enforcement organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency website states that the use of ozone-containing air breath “can reduce the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The European Business Association has opposed new anti-Russia sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In the AEB ' s view, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement stated that business was an important link between countries and people and that free trade should not be restricted.
The European Business brings together over 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The authorities ask the police to restrict traffic on the coast in Pscove
The Pskov People's Elects sent a petition to the Chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the City of Sergey Surin on the issue of movement on the Great Coastal River.
Constance Bolotin, Grigory of Porsenkov, and Valery of Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, control of drivers would help to make the territory more secure and secure.
The problem is that violators ignore the sign of the pedestrian track and travel freely along the coast.
Major repairs and improvements have been made.
Sports and children's spaces are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, on evenings central coastal patrols are conducted by PPP mobile staff and their wives.
They make the number of vehicles that drive less and less, but they do not stop.
Putin demanded the investigative authorities not to remove hard disks
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed that the investigative authorities should not remove servers and hard disks from the workplaces.
The Head of State stated this at a meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “delete, for the benefit of investigation, measures that result in the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard disks from computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it is impossible “to create conditions that prevent the business from continuing until taxes are impossible to pay”.

British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelios Fudge's magic minister in a series of novels about Harry Potter, died for 92 years.
That's what The Independent reported on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the actor's death.
They said he lived "a life of terror, success in movies, theater and television in 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in Cheltnam, England.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier at the Korea Tragedia.
Hardy also remembered the repeated role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of the screens of Agatha Christi's works about Miss Marple.
As part of Churchill's role in the BBC Radio "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the award of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to serve as president of the United States of America, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
In fact, Prince Henri Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his venereal wife, Queen Margrete.
This year four have a golden wedding, but on the agenda of the couple are not the preparations for the feasts, but the marital dispute.
His Highness had given up the title of Prince-Congregorate, and he claimed to the queen that he had never had the title of the king-congregorate appealed to him.
Henryk lives in France, although she remains the queen's official wife.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia called on Washington to stop fermenting Moscow
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russia responded to statements by Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant application was circulated by the foreign policy department some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war images, inadequate contemporary realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to cease to fertilize the Russian Federation.
As Mike Pens, Vice-President of the United States, wrote "Arbitrations of the Week" the previous day, accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vassili Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match of up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, an unsuspecting champion in the light weight of the World Boxing Council, went through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization championship in the second half weight.
Following the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former World Cup in the four weight categories by Erien Broner on Saturday, both boxers are in the five best boxers, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia held out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt in conjunction with Miguel Marriga on Saturday at seven o'clock on ESPN.
When the boxers drew for the photo, Lomachenko Egis Klimas' manager noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would have been the first time.
“I used to be half-weighted, ” recalled Garcia.
"I've risen for Bronner [up to £1440], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to go up to the half [to £135], and then we'll make a match.
That's what fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this unit."
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of his strategy to ensure that Lomachenko waged his debut battle in the weight of 135 later this year to appoint a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who also wanted to fight against the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the World Champion in the Forum arena on 23 September.
“The fight can be on PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing his readiness to fight later on the channel that will offer better financial conditions.
“We are the primary names.
No other names will call for such interest.
As soon as they are ready ... "
Garcia said that she considered Lomachenko a “extreme boxer” and might visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately praise Garcia and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were asking for knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the blow and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing in front of their own unit.
“This battle must be fought.
No other fight is so interesting and interesting.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
He said, "I've been waiting for one of the fat boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great battle.”
On several central streets, Moscow is closing off for the weekend.
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, movement will be restricted in the capital on the street of Tver from the Nastasian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as movement on the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
In addition, the journey will be closed at the Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the first Tver-Yama Street.
At all sites, the overlap will operate on both lanes, reports the Moscow Department of Transport information centre.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their improvement.
On the weekend, traffic on the Moscow Coastal Section will also be closed.
The building of the Vessel Park continues there.
Putin told the Attorney General to check Baikal
President Vladimir Putin of Russia directed the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of Baikal ' s territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Please request the Office of the Attorney-General to verify its territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked for measures if violations were to be found.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of age show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrantsverket) had criticized for not being able to determine the true age of some refugees who had claimed to be minors.
So far, the Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 trials, and the forensic agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were assessed as 18 years of age or older, while in 25 other cases, the forensic agency estimated that the tested person was “probably 18 years old or over”.
In 432 cases, the opinion stated that the person was “probably less than 18”.
Tests shall be conducted only when the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Yohan Hernsson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results are consistent with the results of past months.
“We don't see much difference with statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate”, he said to the Local portal.
The high percentage of cases in which people have been assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have been lying about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 test results and reported that in 442 cases “most likely the age of the tester is 18 years or more”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that he was 18 in progress this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age, consisting of X-raying the wisdom and tomography of knee joints and giving them to dentists and X-rays, has also led to criticism in some authorities.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist at the Karolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose job is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have been sexually mature before or later than usual.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I don’t think I should use the measurement methods that are being used.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define it with certainty, we don't have to pretend we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Goeransen of the Forensic Medical Agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk is wrong to take a child for an adult.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether he would run for the presidency of Russia in the 2018 elections, and transmitted the Interfax.
This statement was in response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Murmushka Buryat region.
During the video conference on the fire-fighting in Buratia and Irkutsk, the interlocutor said to Putin, "Wladimir Vladimirrovović, we ask you: when the next presidential election comes, we will all ask you to run back to this post."
"All right, I'll think, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, the Spokesperson of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, commented on statements by some media that Vladimir Putin's pre-election headquarters would be the head of the administration of President FF Anton Vaino.
The sands referred to these assumptions as “neither on any basis, nor on the basis of hypothetical reasoning”.
"As long as there are no headquarters, until headquarters is established far, before the electoral campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"Not yet on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party
Governor of West Virginia, representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
“You will or will not like it, but the democracies have distanced themselves from me”, said Governor Justice.
“I am speaking to you today with many prayers and many reflections... today I am speaking to you people of Western Virginia: I am no longer able to benefit you while I am a democracy governor.”
The meeting blew up applause.
“That's why tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to the republican,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently."
Before, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited a coal business from his father.
It is estimated to be $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than working to make our country big again”.
“Taking into account only the 15 governors and the control of the lowest number of state legislatures in history, the Governor of Justice's statement is only one more renunciation of the party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message”, reported in CBS News a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ronn McDeniel.
The cat's heavywood call Mr. Beauty found the house thanks to the social media.
A pilot in Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., introduced a cat named Mr. Beauty, weighing more than six pounds [14 kg] after he became famous because of the Internet.
This is what Misable says.
At the end of June, on Facebook, a picture of a cat was published asking for his owner 'cause "it's obviously someone else's food."
In comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could be a new memorial.
The publication received more than 3,000 swearers and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people have expressed a desire to welcome Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was placed in the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to carry on his weight.
In an interview on WNCN, an American woman said that she had had similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about three pounds [10 kg], and now she weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with a photograph of the animal collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she might well have made a career in model business.
Kou praised Russia's “exclusive” apology for the Doping scandal
On Thursday, the International Light Athletics Specialist Sebastian Coe praised what he called sincere apologies from Russia for the Doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not a good time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, Dmitri Puttin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Light Federations, which had been held the day before the World Championship for Light Athlete, that his country's exclusion from sports competition was fair and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals in competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Federations voted in favour of retaining the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of State-funded doping.
“I found that today's response, today's report, was very sincere”, said the President of the International Association of Molecular Federations of Cau, to reporters.
“All the Council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself admitted that it had experienced extremely hot times and was now doing its utmost to see to it that the Federation was being restructured.”
Cau said that he also “began to enjoy” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which it is not the time to restore Russia's rights,” said Cau.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to address this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a closed system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Cup on a light athlete, which will begin on Friday in London.
The Head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Molecular Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for the reconstruction of Russia.
According to his report to reporters in London, following a report on the International Association of Molecular Federations Council, drug testing is still not being carried out in sufficient capacity, and distant coaches are still doing their job in a peaceful manner.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a State official
The journalist Vasili Muravitsky, detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SSA), was taken into custody for two months, and handed over to the MSS.
An Internet member of Journal Gitomir is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and attacking Ukraine's territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this to be “various policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
Comandante Borsini's patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants with the Navy.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to it with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which does not control most of its territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Tobruck-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarsh Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the negotiations between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Head of the European recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegals who had arrived from Libya had been released in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A Major Crash Happened in Skype
A global failure in Skype service has been recorded today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, August 3, the users began mass complaints to the programme developers.
In Microsoft, it was stressed that specialists were already working actively to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, clarifying RIA News.
We will recall that Skype also happened last June.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the assembled Ukraine in light athletics were suspended from participating in the CMM.
The Olga Lander and Olesya Powh, specialized in the short run, are excluded from the assembled Ukraine for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the Federation for Light Athletics (FLAU) website.
This decision was taken by the executive organization in connection with the introduction by IAAF of disciplinary proceedings against minors.
The Ukrainian delegation was also excluded from the list by coach Sergei Bassenko.
IAAF suspects women athletes using doping, reports TheSportarena.
Pow is the bronze tide of Olympiad (2012) and World Cup 2011, the European 2010 Championship at Estaphet 4 to 100 metres, and the Lander at the 2012 European First Nation at Estaphet 4 to 400 metres.
The World Athletics Championship in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimare's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited expenditure by European football clubs would not interfere with the world record of Neimar's transfer from the Spanish “Barcelona” to the French Parry St. Herman.
Whatever the consequences, there may be further along the chain, for Parry Saint-Jerman on the part of WEFA, the governing body of European football control, whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious championship tour of the League of Champions.
From the rules of the financial “fair play” introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that SAF will eventually have to demonstrate that the transfer of Neimar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to exempt Brazilians from the contract, and Neimar would receive a salary that would reach tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
SWW can certainly be distracted to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich energy of Qatar's ruling family.
Clubs are entitled to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFF introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs that fell heavily into debt in their quest for success, in fact, were cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFG ceased to focus on the debt of clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in business model, originally used by Roman Abramović in Chelsea in 2003, to buy a club with good potential and then seriously spend on improving the team and creating a global brand, it became a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which takes place in 2018, clubs may suffer losses of Euro30 million.
And even though Platoni was assassinated from his presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive expenditure.
“It seems that FFG is alive, and we are moving forward to tighten the rules”, said an Associated Press agency, Andrea Traverso, who controls FPF in UEFA last week.
Although SPM will pay for the purchase of Neimar's contract on a lump sum basis, it can pay for this amount for the entire duration of its contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFF sanctions in 2014, the heavy sanctions were imposed on SAF and the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
SWP has imposed a fine of 60 million euros (at that rate $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and has been ordered to limit the composition of its team to the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outdo its financial inspections by spreading their income from the company ' s ownership of the club.
Even though the Qatari company could sponsor SWW, but if funding were considered to be above standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the funding of SPM by the Qatar Tourism Authority had been deployed.
It has been reported that part of Neimar's earnings in SWP could have been paid by the Organization Committee of the 2022 Peace Championship in Qatar.
But SAW and Qatar 2022 deny that Neimar will be the Ambassador of the World Championship, and such a manoeuvre could easily have been found by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SPM mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by individuals familiar with the situation, UEFA did not engage in preliminary discussions with SPM regarding the Neimar transfer.
They were in contact with Associated Press on the basis of anonymity, since SWW was not authorized to discuss the situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, SAW received more than 10 million euros in circulation in Euro542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
TSW expects that the arrival of Neimar will be a favourable ground for sponsoring transactions, selling attributes and t-shirts with a team logo.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent due to the recruitment of a new player.
Undeniably overwhelmed by the fact that one of the best footballers was leaving, the Spanish League tried to prevent the Neimar transfer by claiming that SWP would violate Financial Fair Plei.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with a club and State,” declared the Spanish newspaper “AS” to the President of the League, Javier Tabas, meaning that Qatar is the ultimate owner of SPM.
Arsenala Co. Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
“It's all the consequences of shared participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years,” said Thursday Wenger.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is becoming very difficult to comply with the financial Fair because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens would take an oath of allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President would define such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law as a committee of the State Committee on Legislation and Construction.
A week ago, deputies planned to define directly the order of oaths in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as incapacity, will be released from the solemn oath, followed by the finalized text of the amendments to the draft Law on the Nationality of the Russian Federation (which is at the disposal of the “Iducation”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of the People ' s Duma Vyacheslav Vladin.
The authorities formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the repeal of the decision to extradite nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was that when a person is issued with citizenship documents, he is bound by a commitment to comply with Russian law - on the path of extremism - he is in violation of that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("One Russia"), Gennady Zuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Girinsky (LDP), Sergey Mironov ("Justy Russia") and Speaker, DG Vyacheslav Vladolin.
On 19 May, the deputies received it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Hospitality and Legislation approved the text of the bill by second reading, but it has now been re-edited.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the order of oath.
Previously, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Nationality of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the State Verbistry and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an exercise should take place - a list of places where the erb of the Russian Federation could be located - were governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of State bodies, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, federal executive heads, etc.
Most likely, this could be the registry.
A solemn oath will be given to those who wish to acquire the nationality of the Russian Federation after officials have verified their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be received after the oath has been given, from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text indicates that Russia will take an oath from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There is still a rule by which an incapacity or limited capacity, as well as those who cannot make, read or sign the oath on their own, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
Also in the updated bill, a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens to Russian citizens who are considered to be bearers of Russian language is prescribed.
They would have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine.
Notarized copies of the statement will have to be transmitted to Russian officials.
The rejection of “other” nationality, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
An amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-President of DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Zoroski, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all of whom are “Universal Russia”).
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, a very large number of people are awaiting a decision on their FF citizenship, as explained by Paul Krasheninnikov (ER), head of the Duma Committee on Hospitality and Legislation.
In addition, it was clarified in the text that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for aliens would not apply to those who, in writing, refused “other” citizenship and had surrendered their former passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but who “for reasons beyond its control” had not ceased to be considered a national of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking positions in the municipal service, being employed in facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to Russian security.
Also, a person with dual nationality or residence permits may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force as from 1 September 2017 and that the necessary regulations should be ready at that time.
Nostalgia's become a niche in "The Ward of American Summer" and "The Ward of Detectives."
The current theory of nostalgic history reminds us simultaneously of the famous days of figures in the 1980s; of the age of the fence in the 1990s (approximately when eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Schwarter made a comedy of the "State" for MTV); and of themselves -- that is, the year 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd, moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the exaltation and translation of our age with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems to be anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of the speaking can of vegetables, by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubled in number: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority, thus making it impossible to return to the joke.
Ten years later, where adults have played adults, they have less emotional roots, and their parody is more systemless, and includes the reefs of the steel films of the 1990s, "The Rolling Rock."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled walkers, and "sucks of other things since 1991."
Many stories are the same.
The good - kindness Cooper, now a writer, has not yet won a reciprocity from Cathy (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's also a mad and mean conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Shawolter) is now instigated by George Bush Senior (a proven parody in Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is the retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see young Radd singing Matt Dillon's song from The One, whose character, who's Andy's former great man, looks old.
This franchise would have been successful if random madness had been in the spirit of a recursive "Seven Up" series until it had reached what I thought would have been its logical conclusion: "The Mountain American Summer: Twenty Years later", where the whole company would go to a movie in the last stage to "The Mountain American Summer."
"Uncle Detective" in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the cold war from "Americans" or "Enhancing Blonde" or even "Blake" with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a television show: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist road.
The main roles of Gregor and of the idealist Joseph are played by Florin Pierresick Jr. and Cornelio Ulic, and their dialogues in English were in Changing Tatum (and he is the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levith.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (police spend time watching chess games, how Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices, including Jenny Slatt, Nick Offferman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevinya, makes it interesting to play "remember voice."
But the Detective's Shipship is so holding up for the possibility of an inconspicuous propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and it's not often funny.
If it were done in a shorter way, "The Detective's Chamber" could better handle its satire in the spirit of an agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two fat men are sitting in the lobby, swallowing up a bunch of hamburgers.
An imaginary community observer, this image says Western culture is capable of doing anything to make an obsolescence.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our recent history, and with them too.
The Spartacus-Lokomotivian Super Bowl matches are about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian football League (RFPF) Sergey Plarkin at a press conference.
The winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, according to the head of the FPFL, according to RT.
He also added that there was little left for the match to date.
Spartacus-Lokomotive will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 p.m.
As TASS points out, Spartacus is an active FF champion and Lokomoolte is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young U.S.H. men cleaned the furniture for 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old U.S. statesman with a furniture firm turned to the police the other day.
The man announced the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The production of thieves has become instruments worth almost 200,000 roubles — two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a swan.
The security forces began to search for criminals and soon went out on behalf of the inhabitants of the Bashkortostan region, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs press services, accomplices entered the enterprise, broke the entrance door and removed the tools.
Immediately thereafter, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first car service.
They had already been tried for theft and law enforcement officials had been able to recover only part of the stolen instruments.
The State commented on Medvedev’s comments on the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia should be able to work together.
The official representative of State of State Heather Nauert made such a statement in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, concerning the relations of two States.
The head of the Russian Government stated earlier that by adopting new anti-Russia sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a “low level” but noted that there was a need to seek “cooperational areas”.
"Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for nearly a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," says a diplomat of RIA News.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, President Donald Trump of the United States, has been signed into the past.
He acknowledged, however, that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior grew rose from amethyst and quartz
Dior - Dior Joaillerie, a major unit of the French fashionable house, was added to the Roce Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Roce collections.
They've got five new rings and three black collars on the bartenders.
The Rose Dior Pré Cetalan line produced two new rings and a balloon of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, which were made in gladitics and pavage on the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victuar de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew at his site in Granville, modeler Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Tramp found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump gave a sharp criticism to Congressers.
In the view of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
On the eve of the day Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement in which it stated that the law would not allow the US to enter into beneficial transactions and would bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian businessman refused to purchase the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The businessman from Belarus, Victor Prokorenia, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) a request for purchase of a Sberbank subsidiary unit.
The businessman's decision explained to the RBC the intention “to focus on other of our planned investments and projects that we're working on”.
According to Mr. Prokokeni, such a step would be “a better investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokokenya became the main buyer for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine following the rejection of the application by the NorvikBank Gregory Guselnikov and by the Belarusian company Said Guzereiev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after Peter Porosenko had imposed sanctions on their daughter structures in March.
One such financial organization, other than the WTB and the Wene-Econombank, became Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in Crimea
At the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation referred to the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the agency, Alexander Nowak, explained the incident.
He said that the peninsula was left out of electricity because of an accident in the Krasnodar province.
The truck hit by an electric transmission line in the accident resulted in the removal of Cuban and associated Crimean networks.
The electricity shortages in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Professionals have addressed problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that an abnormal heat could have been the cause of the blackout.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have led to rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England had warned that economic growth would remain inefficient and had left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressures on family income.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with result 6 to 2 for maintaining the rates of 0.25 per cent, with fewer members this month in favour of an increase in the rate, because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that increases in interest rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the brazi inflation and stated that it was likely that borrowing costs would have to rise higher than expected in financial markets.
Committee members also voted to abandon part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago by rexiety.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan by which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it reported that it is now expected to provide an additional £15 billion — up to £115 billion.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said: “The MPC’s main projections indicate that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while pressure on real family income continues to influence consumption”.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that halting inflation would require “a slight tightening of financial policies”, “a few more” than markets expected.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “slow” and “limited”.
Bank growth projections for this year and the following year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has maintained a steady forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
Following these news stories, it fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
The function fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rates had weakened the growth expectation; GDP had then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will start to grow slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's last report on inflation has given little reason for joy to households, which have been affected by high inflation and very small increases in wages: according to the bank, pressure will increase before it decreases.
The Bank added that the financial policy “could not prevent” well over the next few years, but looked forward to a “significant” recovery by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also looking forward to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low rate of pound, which offsets some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent last August following the shocking results of the referendum on exit from the European Union that led to the fall of the pound.
Bank estimates are likely to take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its last decision at the rates, there was a noise around the anticipated increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly affecting the already heavily pressured households: three members of the committee were asked to raise the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
During the past month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and was again offset in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure than the expected 2 per cent is the full result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Mortgage brokers of Korea, said: “If we take account of the recent drop in the swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good year to end.
The market is particularly favourable to those approaching the end of their existing treaties, as refinancing loans, often without a commission, and with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The State Health Service will write an HIV-spore drug to 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug following the battle in the High Court of Justice on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-consumption prevention of HIV (PEP), a drug taken before sex that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection among those at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of approximately 10,000 persons.
It agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ' s decision last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the EPR despite its claims that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was described as “an important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAAT), called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to start registering people, and more schedulers will join the programme in October.
Pre-responsive prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs used to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that REP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When it comes to pre-sexual sex, there's a sufficient amount of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to a drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgeners and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispansers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgeners and persons whose partners are unknown as to whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest veneer's station participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and this week the National Health Service of England signed a purchase contract following an international tender.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of the EDP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, how it is understood and how it is applied on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and strengthen the extensive and increasingly successful efforts aimed at HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
EDP, if it is properly targeted at people in need and at risk, it is an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, people at risk of HIV will gain access to a new and innovative means that a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will improve many and many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing we need to do now is make sure that the test is deployed rapidly throughout the country and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with a experimental REP drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
The Shadow Minister of People's Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: “We very much welcome the start of the EPR test, which was very late for months of delays and delays on the part of the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to halt transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the REP.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons at risk of HIV and to move us forward further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatar and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it was important to retain the presidency in Tatar.
According to the document, the post is “a well established form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatars and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
We recall that since 24 July 2007, a contract between Moscow and Kazanja has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, members of the State Council requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of the post of Head of the region.
At present, Tatar is the only member of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called President.
In Russia, international driving rights have been difficult to obtain
There is a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs) for HGDD units.
To obtain such rights, it takes several weeks to wait, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to take vacations abroad on their car or rent it.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs had been introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In reality, however, everything depends on a particular police or rental office: some require the Ministry of Internal Affairs and others have sufficient national rights.
To protect themselves, drivers of international law are still granted, but it is worth considering that in the non-ratification countries (e.g., the United States, Mexico, Indonesia, Spain), authorities have no right to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all HGDD units, reports Commersante, conducting a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, there are no plates in the UGDD units, and there are no forms available for four months.
You can sign up on the public service site, but it was already in the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is unable to obtain “for technical reasons”, without resorting to detailed information, in the Samara region, it is honestly said that there are no forms, and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Muscovites are already facing the problem, and social media are increasingly reporting:
And Irina Bourmistrow: " & ndash; guess, why don't you get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all HGDD offices have completed their forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question of knowledgeable people!"
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow all the time they've been beaten far ahead, and there's no talons on the scene. (There's a stick, but the tray can't give it.)
The public service portal would seem to show that Sprop time is free to feck.
Did you try to get someone in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for forms of international driving permits have changed, and new forms are being delivered to the State Inspection Unit.
This may be the case with a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made before.
The Blanca purchases the Special Use Centre for Road Traffic Safety (TCDC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the HGDD units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with AO Host: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 forms of IDP were manufactured, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the OO of the First Printing Court for 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the TNC has just failed to conduct a tender on time, which has created a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have made their own journeys to the cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so forth.
Which rights are accepted there is not clear, so people are being insured, and so there's a huge demand for international crusts.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to prove their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The International Driver Certificate (IDP) of the new Model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Ukrainian Minister of Justice, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia ' s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said in an interview on Friday, August 4.
No respected international company will even put talk or bark there because it is at risk of losing its business in the EU, USA, and Japan in the countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, I strongly believe, no prospect for this project," said Petrenko.
He added that he considered Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build smaller objects normally.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums were already being destroyed.
“That's why I think the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so shortsighted to join the project,” said the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the building of the Crimean Bridge road arch.
The Krema Bridge road arch has been built in an in-depth way on the riverbank and will be shut down 45 metres above the base.
“The railway arch was prepared for installation on plumbing pillars” was reported at the project's information centre.
In April, President Vladimir Putin of Russia was informed by Mintrans's head, Maxim Soklov, that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, an official who had not been employed for 10 years was dismissed
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was the chief Spanish official Carlos Recio to have?
The exercise lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not his direct boss.
What only happens in the bureaucrat world?
They seem to have been used to all the voodoos of the people's servants.
And yet officials have been able to surprise those whose taxes they live on.
This time, "sension" has been stinging from Spain.
There, Valencia Carles Recio, an archive officer, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular salaries.
The total strength is 50,000 euros per year.
And here's Mr. Recio's wonderful time.
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
The investigation found that a vicious walker came to the office at 7:00 a.m. every morning to report to the electronic system.
I went home right away.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00 a.m. to be mentioned again in the system that he left.
That's 10 years old.
It also became known that a walker devoted all his free time to drawing comic books at home.
Now, the members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio, the direct chief, who could not help but know how to “actively work” in his work place, his subordinate.
Judges Offer Protection From Presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that their election be introduced.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also present its proposals under the presidential mandate.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin of 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with Council members.
In a meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016, some cases of arbitrary judicial action were discussed, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see “Maw” of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals were made on both the issues of the independence of the judiciary and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlev human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court is of the view that he should be presented for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the power to assign cases to the judges.
Experts allow this to happen, and a specially written computer program can do so.
The HR Committee also considers that the President is not entitled “to determine the qualifications of the judge, to initiate his disciplinary proceedings and to decide on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council believes that it is necessary to move to “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and to “exercise their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are now appointed by the President for six years on the submission of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes a new way of organizing appeals and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to administrative division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that “it is necessary to organize separate courts of appeal and cassation, not at the regional courts level, in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts take the practice of arbitral tribunals as a basis.
They have “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using “telephone law”.
Justices of the Peace of the Human Rights Council propose to strengthen the participation of people in certain “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“It's just our proposals”, explained "Mighty" member of the HRC, judge of the Constitutional Court retired from Tamara Morszzzkov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only for the HR Committee, but also for the Supreme Court (SAF), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the task of the BC (among the perpetrators - the Attorney-General ' s Office and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, the President of the HLC, Vyacheslav Lebedev, must be held until 1 September.
Living a High Life: Half-Divorce and cunning design techniques turned this little apartment in Earls Cort into a simple house
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a vacant house in Nightsbridge in 2014 to an apartment in Earls Court.
The apartment's on the first floor of a nice-looking model house in Queen Anna's style, and in favour of a new design, what Joan didn't get her stuff and moved around again.
"I used to live with my ex-boyfriend in Nightsbridge in a much larger area," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were similar high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered a price that very day."
Since the first inspection, an apartment 1,000 square feet [1,000 sq m] space has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Initially, it was an apartment with one complex design bedroom – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and semi-tethics to make maximum use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azady from the Notting Hill architect and designer studio "Duck & Sed" to use a 12.5-foot ceiling and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be suitable for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two spaces above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-tate where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the reef.
“Working with steel is very difficult”, he explains.
“We had to place them in such a way as to keep them above each other and not have had to bend.
It was not only necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they would be at the right height and allow space to be used from above and from below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full - size rooms above one another in the area visited – and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-deck through the rifle copper light window from Retrouvius, a view of the beautiful living room below is opened.
The silver furniture, silver accentes and vinting lighting devices from Serge Muy make the project's style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of visibility, space and light.
A short corridor framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror shield looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror closets serve to store all Joan's dishes.
In order to create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the emerging kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a sliding door up like a garage.
“The art of engineering was involved in this,” relates Erfan about an armed wood and fibre-optic shield door.
“It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily.”
With the reasonable use of storage space and sites, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
"In the end, the sex area is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for," says Erfan.
“To put it bluntly, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the area of sex.”
Here they were able to expand the floor area by using quality materials that give the space a luxuries of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional connection to the house,” says Erfan.
“No one's falling in love with electricity in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts.”
This is an indication that with good design and increased subways, the apartment can become something that's more common than usual.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The order is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Head of the Commission is appointed Vice-Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan to implement a public cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the impact of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the same cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has been reduced to an eight-year minimum
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has decreased to the minimum in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that the inflation rate in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower in October 2009, when the price growth index was 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a decline in Russia's consumer price index of 0.1 per cent.
The agency thus registered the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economics, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - by this agency ' s version, 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal cutting of Baikali taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal Territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donski, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits logging during fires and the Government plans to adopt it in the fall.
The President, in turn, stated that the project should be monitored so that “all contracts would not be cut out” during the cut-off process.
Donski noted that the bill involves monitoring by the Ministry of Health and the supervisory agencies.
Media: VJF elements in secret from command agree with the Donbasa militia
A regular telephone service has been established in Donbasa on the line of armed conflict.
Combatant fighters are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they are not known at headquarters.
The VSU and the Donbasa militia have established cell phones in secret from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua refers to participants in the military operation in Donbasa.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreement”.
Part of the result of such discussions is a truce on a certain section of the front.
The journalists were informed of cases in which greetings from the day of birth of an officer were received from his formal enemy from the front line.
The VSU and the NAMA and LNR militias have been sitting in trenches on the line of separation since the beginning of Ukraine ' s military operation against Donbasa since the spring of 2014.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has outraged the freezing of UNSA statements on attacks against the Russian Embassy
The Russian foreign policy department is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the United Nations in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Syria.
This is what the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports.
The agency recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August had been subjected to mortar fire from the terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat Al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation) and Actak Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization by Nusra, and UNS resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation stated that “it seems clear that the terrorist attacks of the Nossra should face universal unequivocal and firm condemnation and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of the attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as emphasized in the Department of Public Information, “For the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council alternately, varying the tone of objections, under the pretext of the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement by the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us must remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“It is most shocking that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity”, stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them at the same time”.
Vladimir Putin spoke in favour of limiting the number of emergency business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during the Investment Project Meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of emergency business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of planned, and that the time for inspection should be limited to 10 days.
“Extraordinary checks are generally carried out without proper consultation with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent agree with the Public Prosecutor's Office and everything else goes on its own”, cites the President of TATSA.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from removing servers and hard disks from businesses.
In addition, in the view of the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will have some positive implications for the consideration of business cases or for the violation of the business law”, said the Head of State.
As reported by the EAR, there is an increase in the number of other types of business inspections due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections.
In May, at the request of the businessOmbudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov was conducting a survey, which revealed that there had been actual replacement of scheduled inspections from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016, by prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and citizen applications (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (from 10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million -- 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton football club and the builder of Colin de Luther live in Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother, Paul, who filed a claim against him by the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a bitter divorce dispute.
Along with her mother, Ana's brothers own 87 facilities worth more than half a billion dollars since their family bought a store on Smith Street in collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 shopping points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the de Luvis family property list now includes office buildings, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller and shopping centres in suburbs.
According to an agreement with Colin's late father, whom Paul describes as “the main driving force and dominant personality” of De Luteuris' family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third of its assets.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first hearings of the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, which Paul believes Colin excluded.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of incompetence in the management of certain sites.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family to be the highest priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are increasing as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, PitcherParters and Charter Keck Cramer are involved; both parties have attracted the best known lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best movers.
Mrs. De Luvis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they managed milk bars and gastronoms and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last classroom, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Luuris says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi has often told me that he doesn't want brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Luvis; Colina says Mark got 10 million when he left business and Luke was 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to Eddie McGir's 2015 biography, was the best friend of the TV set.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded with a text message stating that since the case had not yet been tried, “I have nothing to say.”
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and speak to my family in court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding, "still hoping for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, that hope must have been scattered.
"Our case will soon be decided by the court," wrote Colin.
The new head of Trump's apparatus plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
Then he'll be the first.
Polico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trumpou, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the Chief in a calmer state.
This is what reporter Josh Doozy says.
“At a meeting that held the new head of the White House apparatus, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem at the White House under President Donald Trumpe, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President.”
Kelly told the staff that the information should pass through him - paper or briefings - because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have already failed trying to put Trump on track by tracking the information he has received.
President Trump's relationship with television was formed decades ago -- and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Trump, as candidate, was outraged by the unfair publicity of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair publicity in publications that could be persuaded," said in February "Policco" Sam Nanberg, former electoral officer.
Tara Palmeri wrote back at the time at "Policy" that "in the words of six former members of the electoral staff to control Trump's practice of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the information he received in person contains a constant flow of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of Twitter was ever "under control" was funny.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump has never published.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Trump from falling oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trumpa with material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Policy" -- that's the story -- wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly give the President questionable information.
Consider one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Recent and former Trump officers say that Trump can react very harshly to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone put a copy of an article on GotNews.com by the President, Charles C. Johnson's Internet promotion website, in which the deputy chief of staff of Cathy Wells was accused of being “standing behind a number of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever forgotten on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't present specific facts, or that in the past he launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then chief of apparatus, Raines Pribus, and the secretary of Rob Porter, "tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Fubus, but Trump still has an inflammatory disposition, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly ' s task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor's Office is fighting the HIV dissident.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the decision of the Kalinininian dys Justice Tumeni to stop criminal proceedings against a local woman who had died of HIV from a young daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility in reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office considers that the crime cannot be left unpunished to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a Tumeni woman was initiated under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (a cause of death due to negligence), in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV positive.
“The woman did not treat herself and refused treatment of her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, explained the Office of the Prosecutor of Tumen Province.
A criminal case was brought before the Kalininian Paradise of Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl made an application, explaining that “he has forgiven his wife, has no claim against her, has done harm and has apologized.”
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not accept the court ' s decision and filed an appeal requesting that the decision to terminate the case be reversed and that it be referred for further consideration.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime was impossible to repair.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection”, reported to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the view of the supervisory body, she should be punished, otherwise her case should be followed by other HIV dissidents.
According to the Tumen Center for AIDS, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in Tumensk province who are not receiving medical care because of parental refusal.
“And this situation has improved - in the year of the work of the special group, half of parents who have categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their mind - allowed diagnostics, accepted medications,” said Yelen Lodev, a spokesman for the AIDS Center.
She said that it was not possible to influence parents in a legislative way, and not all HIV-positive children were able to be detected - mothers were not allowed to survey them, hide them, and run with children from hospitals.
HIV dissidents are at risk
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and AIDS service activists call such views anti-medical, and their spread poses a serious threat.
The terrible photo session, which ended in the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Grechana railway station in Hemelnitzk.
A fun company of drunk young people was walking by bridge over railways, where it was just a freight train.
One of the friends had the idea of making an effective selves on the roof of the wagon, and informed Fatam in the communications sector of the police in Helnitzka district.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his carelessness, he got caught up in the power line and immediately got hit by a shock.
Fortunately, this incident became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately caused the “unsolved”.
Prior to the visit, the victim ' s doctors were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Hemelnitzka District Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns at the 1-2 degree torso.
His condition is now being assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that in recent times extreme selves have become increasingly popular on the roofs of multi-decks, bridges, and transport.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans to exist in ancient Venus
The oceans could have existed in ancient Venus.
French scientists have made such an assumption.
Experts have developed a computer model that demonstrates the process of creating water on the planet's surface, writing Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of its history, there were oceans that had 10% more water than there were now on Earth.
Previously, “Arguments of the Week” wrote that according to scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts have concluded in their studies that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured by fire at San Francisco Park
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting, transmitting the Asociated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the wicked ones could not be considered, for they had all but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third victim is a minor and no details of his condition are available.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
Louna's rock group will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna rock concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album, The Big New World, which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The collective prepares a concept show that will become the most vivid in the band's concert history.
The "Walk New World" is the fourth album of Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous anti-anti-topic novel O. Hucksley, "The Strange New World."
The new songs do not represent the book, but they tell of a society that lives by the law of anti - utopia, “the blind belief in propaganda and imposed values”.
The group was helped to raise money for the album: over 1,200 people supported the project on the Planet.ru website.
Louna released her first album, "Let's Do Groche!" in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented Time X, and in 2013 they recorded the album "We Are the Law" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna team delivered a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Halle with the "The Song of Peace" program.
In the group of Lusine Gevorkiang (scow), Vitaly Demidenko (bas gytar), Ruben Kazaryan (hytar), Sergey Ponkratiev (hytar), Leonid Kinsbourski (Arabs).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club "Faraon" on October 17th at 7:00.
Tickets: 1,200 to 2,600 roubles
Louna is one of the required groups on the Russian rock screen.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group has won several times in various denominations of "The Black Dujin".
The Roma have overcome the moat and have returned to the streets of the millionaires.
Some of the richest homeowners of Western Midland again conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome the ravine that has been grown by the municipal authorities in order to reoccupy the fields next to their homes.
They parked 20 houses on their wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solikhal, a ridiculously called “millionaire Street”.
With horses, babies and many houses on their wheels, they returned after being expelled no more than May, and they were not disturbed by the moats dug up by municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in defence facilities and crossed its vehicles through an area that had not been protected to leave space for the trip.
Inflamed residents attacked the municipality of Solikhal, saying that it had been “unable to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here on Monday night after they were driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones into passersby."
Municipality should be shamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
They were here in May, they were driven away, and then they came back again.
Last night there were more Roma, and today there may be more.
“Municipality Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judgements to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even end it.”
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these Roma leaving the previous time, and please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse on the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla stated: “We know of an illegal camp on land near Streetsbruck Road and we cooperate with the Solikhal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police via telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
The Crimea shares a champagne wine factory called the New World.
The State Department of the Republic of Crimea has decided to take action by turning the champagne Winning Plant “New World” into the UAO, following an order issued by the Minister of Property and Land Affairs of the Crimea, Anne Anuhina.
100 per cent of business shares will remain in the State of Crimea.
The capital stock of the equity society will amount to rouble 595.5 million and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares at a nominal cost of 100 roubles each.
The Crimea Ministry of Agriculture stated that if funds were not found to upgrade the plant within the next three years, there would be a risk of stopping the plant.
The enterprise ' s core cost is around 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion roubles to be modernized, and due to the features of the organizational and legal form, it is required to pay 50% of its income to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about borrowing money from large credit organizations is difficult," said Mr. Crema Sergei Péthelin’s vice-chairs in April of this year.
The Crimea Parliament included an enterprise in the privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed that it be stocked and traded.
The source of Interfax in the Crimea authorities assessed the potential value of selling an enterprise at $40 million, and the investor's investment in upgrading at $30 million.
The “New Light” increased the production of Igritic wine by 2.8 per cent from the level of 2015 to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The business was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golitsin, as a production plant for the Igritic wine in his acquired name, New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The following third graders have broken down more than 40 graves
The Ministry of Internal Affairs officials in the district below have identified citizens who have destroyed 46 graves in the city of Liskovo.
The students of the third class were misinformed.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknowns was made to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Liskov region on 27 June.
In all, 24 persons have been called to the police on this matter.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Enhancing, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified suspects and found them two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching monuments fall, which led them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone towards NGOs that save migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said Home Minister Mario Minnit in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
Minni's warning was sounded the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rattet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had been working for only a year, had refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrodjo Cartoio.
“The salvation of human life is and remains the highest priority for us, so we regret very much that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone right now”, says the statement of the organization in the social media.
“We will be able to assess all the allegations made now, only after we have collected all the information and assessed the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Yuventa vessel belonging to Jugend Rett since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken migrants on board full of lifeboats who were sent directly to them by traffickers and of allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was said to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as claimed by the prosecution, which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coast authorities, who control the rescue operations in the zone, rather than for any other reason.
The code of conduct implies primarily that the Juventa courts will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code: “Stare the Children”, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Rassemblement from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not cause any “significant change or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there was a Nobel prize-winning organization, Doctors without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnit said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly increased their policy in the Libyan direction and, with visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been involved.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on the Internal Settlement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Dumadé, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dygov, described the objectives of Moscow in the region and at whom the bet.
The contact group on Libya you're leading is almost unknown.
Let's say the Ukrainian contact group knows about it.
And here's a cover of secrets.
What exactly do you do, and what are your goals?
A contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
It is run by Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhan (Duma Deputate of Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Dumada Vyacheslav Vladolin.
The formation of the group was followed by the detention in Libya of the Russian tank vessel Mechanic Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 on board).
We've been thinking about how we can help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led her?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from Chebotarev Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict and on the side of Tripoli (where the United Nations recognized Government is headed by Faiz Saraj. “Bear”) and Tobruk (resident of Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports the march of Khalif Khaftar, which controls eastern Libya.
Thanks to Ahmed Metiga's active participation, we quickly agreed to release Russian sailors.
It was then decided to establish a contact group to make better use of these contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are in Libya all the time?
The contact group is now composed of five persons.
Among them are people with military experience, including in the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to join the regional team of specialists from the Institute of the Middle East.
None of our staff are always in Libya, and this is not necessary.
Whether there are Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya right now.
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group has ex-military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurat (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi in 2011 and which were markedly intensified in subsequent years.
We arrived in Misurat last January.
We were scared, they said you'd make it up to Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation ourselves, to examine the real military potential behind what is behind the rumours, which are really the role of Islamists there.
In Misurat, we met with all the representatives of the forces involved in the destruction of the IH in Sirte (in December 2016, this town on the Mediterranean coast was taken off by the fighters of the banned Russian State, the “Islamic State” — “suddenly”).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they were the ones who played a crucial role in destroying the IH in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merit to himself.
And what did you conclude?
Is it not Haftar who won the Islamic State in Libya?
It wasn't him who did it.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, the structures under the government in Tripoli were fighting.
And by the way, we invited people to Russia who were conducting this counter-terrorism operation.
And they arrived -- the visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation received a visit to the Federation Council, to Duma, MID and Rosgvardiya.
You, we understand, are in all Libyan regions, and you probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Khaftar and Faiz Saraj can be implemented?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good sign for us, not too long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And with regard to Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many of whom believe that.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian air carrier admiral Kuznetsov that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in a coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is just to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all key players in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar spoke.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to learn twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian, if he knows, it's very relative.
But what we learned, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with military personnel in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak great Russian.
And clinging to Russia, and to some extent experience nostalgia on it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted expeditiously?
Do your Libyan interlocutors care about the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, but as I said, we are not taking sides in this conflict and we do not want to arm one another to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be about equal.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
Libya is now actively pursuing the process of drafting the Constitution.
We hope that the parties will arrive at compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then, elections are to be held, as was said at the meeting of Saraja and Haftar.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and no party now has such status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo can be asked in the United Nations.
To raise this issue now meaninglessly and dangerously would only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
In the days before, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of Libyan African refugees, felt abandoned by allies from the EU.
Could Moscow in this situation help Italian partners by using its ties with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic is the option for Haftar to take control of the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're actively working on this.
The Italians need support from Russia because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the South.
In this regard, tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they stand ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it that the southerners stop the flows of migrants on far-off offensives?
I mean, on a conditional basis, you're sending back buses where Nigerian migrants go?
We're trying to do it.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in ensuring that these flows continue to flow.
We hope to help unify the South in the negotiations between Saraj, Khaftar and the tribes of the south.
But to begin with, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Khaftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government at Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered to be an Islamist, a supporter of the application of Sharia standards in the country.
How radical is he?
Would it not be an obstacle to a relationship with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion on him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the view that Libya must be a totally normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in not getting there.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started to communicate actively with Tripoli and Tobruk.
We are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneffti has entered into a cooperation agreement with Libya ' s oil company, NOC.
The Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom head Rosneffti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of the Libyan oil from the Company "Rosnepht".
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
In plans to re-sign contracts concluded with Muammara Gaddafi.
These include former transport arrangements (rail-building), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
What do Libyans have to pay?
Well, they've got oil.
I mean, as with Iran, is this an oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what's going to happen, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not important.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya will cease to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and of forcing terrorists out of it.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group has been to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that to date no Russian or other former USSR country is there.
He said that he had about 50,000 records of telephone conversations between Islamic and radical groups (in Libya.
And from which States, then, are these fighters?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll write the question differently.
How many Islamic militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are hardly any Libyans, not more than 5% of them.
The rest are gone.
Is Moscow able to conduct intra-Lebanese negotiations on the example of Paris?
There's plans like this.
We are engaged in intensive negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have indicated their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits must still take place, and then, hopefully, there will be clarity as to the time and location of the negotiations.
At the Czech Museum, the charity raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macol, who has DFS, brain hydrocephalium and complete blindness, will be given a gift on 5 August as a special runway.
Sasha is provided with a useful presentation by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum.
The trainer's money was collected during the charity marathon, "Don't give up on doing good," which was held in Melihov on July 15, 15th, on Chekhov's Day.
On the eve of a marathon at the museum, they received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushino in Chekhova district, saying, "I don't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a gift of running along so my legs can be strong, and I'd just learn to walk."
And when Sassina's dream came true!
Following the presentation of the museum-reserved museum, the Concept-postscriptum, a prominent pianist, will be the well-deserved artist Alexander Gindin of Russia, who will perform popuries from popular classics.
During the charity marathon in Melhove, there was a chorus of the Wiessen David Desert, a call from Ilya Drosdikhin workshop, students from the P.I. Moscow Conservatory and the Gnesin Academy of Russia, artists from the Melokhov Theatre of the Chekhovian Study.
Public auctions were held, book fairs were organized and gifts were sold with marathon logo.
The Mihihovo Reserve has taken the initiative to make Chehove's Day of Memory on 15 July a day of charity in all the Podmoskovia Museum.
A 30-year-old resident of Oleska Gitomir district near a local football stadium fired several shots at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, reported to the Gitomir District Police Communications Division.
The man then entered a nearby cafe.
He had a conflict in the building in which a man used rubber bullets to shoot a visitor.
A 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical treatment and no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had been hiding by then.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet-shot device removed that's being tested.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is liable to 3-7 years ' imprisonment.
Recall that on 28 July, a shooting attack took place in Kiev in Lukianowka in the region of the Tatar street on the night of 28 July.
Michelle Carter's sentence for reports that caused Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for having been led by text messages and telephone calls to suicide by her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of imprisonment and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Konrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at large until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers claimed that she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the sentence of standing and shook his hands and dropped his eyes.
"In her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't recognize responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was “a tragic case she deeply regrets”.
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant impact on her actions”.
The Prosecutor read out statements from Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying: “Not a day has passed before I mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I do it -- I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said that she was adamantly thinking that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be aunts of his children.
"To be married to someone who's always been with me since I was born is a pain that stays with me for the rest of her life," she said.
This case would seem to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law that provides for the responsibility of advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been led to suicide by Carter’s message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a few messages she sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted attention with Roy's death and prohibited her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The legal profession was divided on this point.
One of the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Missel Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prison."
Eugenius Goddeschet said, "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight."
One of the best basketballists of the One League WTB was 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The U.S. Advocate's Departure to "Izves" commented on Unica's President, Eugen Egochev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, and told Eugenius the Riches.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I've decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He won three seasons in UNICS, and in each match he showed a high level, he'd be up to 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-air bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and in his career.
Keith Langford won the Casana Club for three years, winning the Silver League (2015/16).
During the 2016/17 season, he received the prize of the most effective player in the Euroliga season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per match.
The result has been the second since 2004 when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroliga, who received the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, informing Europeans.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford is going to be the second in July to be the star of the Eurolig, which is going to be the Chinese championship.
Jannis Burus had previously moved to China's CBAs.
A sunlit tourist from Podmoskovia was evacuated by a helicopter in Adiga
Adigeian rescuers have been evacuating a satellite tourist from the mountainous region of the Republic, who received the strongest solar burns.
The man was resting at the Fish shelter at a height of 1.6 thousand metres.
A 27-year-old tourist was pressured and breathing was difficult to breathe.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergy response.
The rescue team leader told them that the man's burns had been burned in the camp.
Audi will be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW stated that it would propose to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of BMW stated that the company believes that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Damler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies referred to their step as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But oxides of nitrogen, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
It is also difficult to maintain a competitive price for vehicles for the installation of equipment that neutralizes diesel vehicles' exhaust gases.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, the Chancellor's Government, Angela Merkel, was also accused of following powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of problems.
Companies try not to repeat the Volkswaggen error, which conceals the use of so-called “damage devices”, which, during testing, could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and, under normal driving conditions, are excluded.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagan were convicted and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagan after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of “Audi” in the investigation may pose serious problems for “Folkswagen”: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of the income of “Folkswagen”.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to a coffee shop paid false money
The police received a report from a bank's office regarding the discovery of money derived from a general hospital, a suspicious purchase of 5,000 roubles.
A study carried out at the Centre for Expertise and Criminalist Studies revealed that it was false.
As reported by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the district of Astrakhan, the bank note was paid by a visitor to the coffee shop who bought the saurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a bather's authenticity instrument.
Police officers are currently identified as involved in the manufacture and marketing of a well-known counterfeit BFB ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls upon the inhabitants of the Astrakhan region to be attentive to financial transactions; it is recommended that commercial workers install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "Ad" planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised at its temperature, which was able to evaprate iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so hot with light that infrared radiation is emitted.
The Hubble telescope has sealed the flashes of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the atmosphere of the planet to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "burning yucters" -- gas giants, by size and mass, comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but situated dozens of times closer to the parent star.
As a result, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 “earth” days, and its gas shell is nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It became a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now feared to be threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has become worse due to dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has caused constant headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lavanda in Provence is in fact under threat, because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change, with much less rain falling in the spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There are also small cicadas that jump through the leaves, insects that carry microbacteria, and in very dry weather, there are many of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very useful in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "In place of very long colosses with a lot of big flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or none at all.
That's why we have fewer parts containing air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improved water distribution and a slowing down of evaporation from the soil, as well as incinerating plants with protective mixtures of clay and water and removing varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador Wintery Universidad-2019 met with the red-headed schoolchildren
Two-fold hockey World Championship, Ambassador Winter University-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with start-up hockeys and distributed autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the Winter University tent (2019) during the thematic week on the hockey with the jayba.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on horseback at an artificial ice site.
In addition, estaphethes, Victorians and games were organized with the play of the gift-makings of student games, the blurring of the Federation of Aerobics.
Fifty schoolchildren attended.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible at sports sites and stressed that the most important initial stage of education was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
"It's great that there's an area in Krasnoyarsk that's like the Winter University tent 2019 where start-up athletes can ask direct questions to team trainers," said the champion.
Note that the Ambassadors of Winter University 2019 help promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among the red-headed.
The department will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reporting to the Department of the Winter University Department (2019).
In Gosdepébé commented on Medvedev’s words
In commenting on the briefing by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Mr. Dmitri Medvedev, U.S. State Secretary Heather Nauert, stated that there was a need to find a “beneficial for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found “to improve bilateral interaction”.
One example of this successful cooperation, Nauert, was the Syrian Armistice Agreement.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work together," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim that Russia and the United States had a full trade war.
"If Russia has said that, of course, it has the right to speak, but I can't say more on that subject," said the representative of Gosdep.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on a new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, the Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would take decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, U.S. artifact, believes that Trump has been “purely won”.
Lost in Podmoscow Bodibilder found someone else's memory lost.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov was missing on the Noginsk road on 25 July under very pick-up circumstances: he stepped out of the car cabin to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully sought out by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamel's on a stranger's date in Ramenski.
He was totally naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete was unable to explain how he was here and what had happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
The announcement of his missing had helped to establish his identity.
Doctors who came by the phone recorded a partial memory loss and a brain injury to Hanmet’s office, reports the Mush pub.
Perhaps there are other surprises waiting for the athlete.
Those who abducted Shamil may have been in his apartment, the keys to which he was also taken.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, oil and gas revenues from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, was due mainly to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per rouble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and exports of oil products of projected levels.
“The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from a monthly estimate consistent with the Federal Budget Act for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 to amount to +40.2 billion roubles”, says a report from the Ministry.
Thus, the total amount allocated to foreign exchange purchases in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 amounts to 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases.
Every working day during this period, the CB will enter into transactions to purchase foreign currency on the organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange on an even basis during the trade day.
The acquisition of foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury at Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Members of the weekly Riodosé usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to highlight recent violent crimes in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown into 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on a board hanging in the room three words: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and feelings will be sufficient.
They are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the Government or cartels, a whole list of bullies that makes the work of lighting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is no more prevalent, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 persons, after attacks and threats, are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer, the co-founder of Riodos, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the title “Justy” hanging on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carrying T-shirts depicting his smile, face or firmnam.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
The journalists of Riodos insist that they will report violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although they are now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, there is little benefit in talking about security at meetings,” Ibarra says.
"It's stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left Riodose's office in Koulikaan State Capital.
He was able to travel only a few blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twenteenth River".
The shooter drove off on his car and hit her nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two grown children left.
Hearings usually vary rapidly across Kuliakán.
But almost everything is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited in the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with painted two - story mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "rest" is just when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and pathways to U.S. drug trafficking.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by the feeling of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, leader of one of the rival sections of the cartel, who is fighting with the sons of Guzman.
The publication may have made sons angry; people suspected of being members of a gang bought up all copies of the publications as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized and had written about the same story.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter in The Neroeste and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the subject of drugs”, said Bohorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of bold and honest publications, sales, and advertising incomes.
The journalists liked that they were able to publish bold reports, not because they were afraid of censorship, but because they were attracted by the readers to read about what they no longer dared to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodose received a prestigious prize for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate Mexico's drug trade wherever it leads.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said to the CPJ Award.
The drug trade in Cinloa was “this way of life”, he said last October in an interview with Rompeveento TV.
"You have to accept tasks that fall on you both as a journalist, either, or you're just being stupid."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around me... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodose's staff miss Valdez, a joke who fought like a cargoer in port, a friend who's generous in arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to get into the living.
They relied on their order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking, "Did he lose his love for one another?"
His death caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like you taking care of their wives, children, their legal business and clandestine airfields for drug transport.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-reservedness.
We have to trust our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says editor Andrés Villareal, is that "warming can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he says and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa - like Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
Landschaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodose staff met for security training, cellular telephones were suddenly banned: a few days earlier, it had become known that spy programmes sold exclusively to Governments were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Two policemen hide in the shade of a 104 degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the State Government to protect the Riodose office, which is located in a four-bed building in the turjuise district of Kulyakana.
Some journalists were asked for half a minute whether these police officers included 50 per cent of the ministers of order, of whom the Governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of drug traffickers' gangs.
In the nearest Riodose, three main topics were expected.
This is the murder of a brother of a former champion on the side of Julio Cezar Chávez.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the Governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive Kuliakana restaurants in the block from the DA's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it had happened, so it was time to be careful to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant for both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated at all levels of power over the past century.
Recently, a number of Governors have been accused of corruption by PRI.
Villaréal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman slipped from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We would already know what happened," says 46-year-old Villaral, for his thin body, called "El Flacco."
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdés Cabinet is now being used as a repository for posters and stickers protesting the killing of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would be: activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took a number of posters and went to the local prosecutor's office on another journalist the next morning.
El Salvador Adama disappeared in the state of Michoakan in the west three days after Valdez was killed.
Found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak more loud, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support for the demand for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with Governor Cinoloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that she not be given more tasks to highlight the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said on many occasions that journalists in Mexico are “enclosured” by organized crime, its accomplices in government and a indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug and Journalist, he wrote that reporters were not just killed by drug traffickers; they did so on orders from politicians and security services who were in conflict with organized crime.
The press protection committee, Arctico 19, believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were carried out by police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killing's frightening people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, allegedly written by Zetas Cartel: “I'm here because of my articles.”
Computer keyboards and headphones were next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close down as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to follow as El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels by means of a drafting article on page 1, entitled “What do you want us to do?”
Some journalists have left their native states or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find employment and they continue to face dangers on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risk solutions daily.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's scared of writing about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the latest issue was ready for press, Riodos publishers were sitting on a sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of gunfights between rival gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 dead bodies behind, according to confirmed evidence.
The war continued to unfold, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
As they sat on the sidewalk, they put news on Riodos' website on their cell phone.
The next day, I had to change the first page.
The sirens were fired nearby, another gunfight in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at all.
Siting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their paper, whose middle finger was projected by the whole of Sinaloa, Riodos continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorquez, "if the very day that Javier was killed, he asked me to send her out to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used a mosquito to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, even though it's frightening.
The researchers reported that the first found remains of an incredible type of rhino - sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner were preserved so well that experts called it “My Lisa Among Dinosaurs”.
It has been so well preserved that they have even been able to determine that the colour of his bunny skin was redish brown and to say that he had, in some way, “the dark past”.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well preserved of Tyre’s history of discovery and one of the best copies of the dinosaur in the world”.
It's a fossil — a recently found copy of a nodosaurus living in the middle of a melodious period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has puzzled researchers who call him “validly remarkable”.
This herb - eating thyrophoric is the best preserved fossil record ever found, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working in the Millenium mine of Sankor near Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the rock and decided to look more carefully.
The fossil record he discovered was sent to the Royal Thyrrellov paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, work was done on finding an animal within the ground depth of 2,500 feet (100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the outcome can be demonstrated.
“It's only worth a little while, and you can almost believe he's asleep”, said Dr. Caleb Brown, chief author of the Royal Tyrellian paleontology Museum, where creation is shown.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
As they studied his skin, researchers discovered that he was herbalized, even though he was covered with panacea and resembled a walking tank, they seemed to be exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerfully-covered dinosaur used red and white mosquitos to hide from predators and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to combine himself more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering enemies, say experts, assuming that larger dinosaurs were hunting him.
This creature, at 110 million years of age, belonging to the Nodoosaur family, was widely featured in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Thyrrellah paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and have given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum labist Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours digging for it.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scholars to document the drawing and shape of the cheshaks and pancreas on his body.
They discovered a protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective colors are common, the discovery is a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of the living animal with a protective dye.
It may be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively hunted by fertilized dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern - day protected animals — such as deer, silver, or bronze — are much smaller and more affordable, indicating that nodosaw has had to struggle hard to survive.
“The serious threat of predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur's shell shows how dangerous Mel's predatory dinosaurs were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dynosaurus Czechs also indicates that their skin should have been redish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the remaining contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and its back was down on the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are now.
“This nodosaur is indeed remarkable for covering the remaining effluent skin completely, while being fully preserved in three dimensions while retaining the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost like it looked like it then in the melodious Paradise period.
You don't have to use imagination to re-establish it, you just have to try a little hard, and you can almost believe he's asleep."
The melodious period is an era when giant terrors, two-legged carnivores, roamed the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrant of the river, lived a million years later than Borealopelta, one of his formidable ancestors could have been hunted.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 m) long, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries appear in the magazine Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified.
The property was found by Sean Fank when he was working at Millenium mine near Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the best preserved typophorus in the world, along with skin and panacea, and it's whole, from the face to the femur bones.
On average, these bodies reached about 18 feet (5 m) in length and weighed up to £3,000 (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic feature was two 20-inch necks from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that this grassy thyrophorus has been a difficult step in what Canada is now until the spilled river takes it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its shell accurate to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular copy were so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bungricular pancreas along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greszko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security “is rare as winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossil remains of the skin still cover bungricular pancreas, plumbing the animal’s skull.
His right fore leg is stretched along the side, his five fingers are tilted up.
I can count on his soles."
Mikhail Saakashili managed to get into Poland without papers
Mikhail Saakashivi, formerly head of Georgia and then the district of Odessa in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
However, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili reports on the arrival of the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which placed on its YouTube channel a video of his presentation.
Saakashivi took part in an event to commemorate the Warsaw Rebellion against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he was trying to start speaking that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician referred to Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and also to Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian Migration Service had deprived him of his nationality led to the discovery of an opulent politician in the United States.
How he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former Governor of Odessa province, Mikhail Saakashili, stated earlier that his signature on the questionnaire for Ukraine ' s citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
In the case of Weinzicher and Olkhović, the investigation was extended until January.
The preliminary investigation of the joint owner of the Renova group Evgeny Olkhović and the head of the T Plus Energy Holding has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court is considering the extension of the accused ' s house arrest.
The representative of the UK reported on the decision last time to extend the preliminary investigation.
“The special complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to remove and examine a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several FF entities”, the investigator stated.
He added that suspects regularly gave bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Wynzicher, Olkhović, as well as the former head of the WAO, Michael Slobdin, who, prior to 5 September, had been the head of the company Vimpelka, had been bribed to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for setting maximum interest tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating an enabling business environment.
Wynzicher and Olkhović were detained, stratified into tictivcar and arrested for two months, Slobdin fled the investigation and was declared federally wanted.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the depths of his soul.
Just one day after arriving in New York, as part of a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and he's still in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else on her tape had posted this information, puzzled, she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
There were lots of user posts on the tape with @TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown’s lifeless body, which would be spread out in the street for four hours.
'It's wildness,' thought Ferrel.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She postponed her phone, and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a signal tape and shouting people and a man who claimed that he was Brown's father, who made a poster saying, "Ferguson's police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman said, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals!"
"It's not the usual situation," according to Ferrel's own memory, said then.
“It's not murder like the ones we're used to and we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt obsessive.
I was angry and cried."
She took a return ticket and left home the next day.
When she landed at 11: 00 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next almost three years was the theme of a new documentary film entitled “Who Are the Streets?”, which will appear on the screen on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and endurance in terms of people living in and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a dress of flowers and a crown of color, they recalled the conversation that had been held so many times earlier this morning, “about the experience of the blacks and their situation”.
She recalls saying: “Do you remember how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't help it," Ferrel said later.
"What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She should know about it, see it, and be brought up to do it.
It must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their situation, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she will not face obvious racism herself, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad job if I had to drive her away from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop was made at the South Florida Road Square on the road from a police station that had become something like a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the final innocence of Officer Darren Wilson
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local businessman who was preparing lunch packs.
They collected packages and helped give them to the protestors.
Little by little, Ferrel's consciousness took shape with a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was the President of the Association of Sanitarian Students, National Minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health inequalities among the Black Communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
This came to pass by itself.”
A few weeks later at the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of her co-facilitators.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “simply wanted to document” events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can play?"
This skepticism has been worn by many people, often whites, who have come to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently”.
Folayan had already united with his co-founder Damon Davis, a local painter known for his activism on death row prisoners.
His involvement was a source of sympathy for the Ferrel project and for six other local residents with whom the Chi Streets Project team maintained contact during the years since Brown's murder.
"This documentary isn't someone talking for us or us, we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
“This was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because it's how I'm going to be represented.”
Although the project was not intended to focus on Ferrel's experience, it was in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader but about how the community is uniting”, as Folayan said, that it was the most open of the film participants.
As a result, The Whose Streets? shows the sudden personal aspects of Ferrel's life, for example, how she fell in love with and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing at the first time she saw a finished product.
“But I realized that when you do that work and treat black people with dignity, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of Trevon Martin's black teenager in 2012 - are considered homosexuals.
“The black homosexual women in decision-making positions support this movement,” says Ferrel. “And that's because we're always fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and numerous homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrel was not elected central character of the film because of its distinctive characteristics.
“She was the person who provoked this energy,” she said.
“ On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it’s at first because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been out of film cameras, but complex racial ties remain between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for two and a half years for closing the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home simply as “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she walked out of Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadorian football players disqualified for U.S. players ’ bite
The Footballists of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long disqualifications for unsavory behaviour.
During the fourth final game of the Golden Cup, the North and Central American and Caribbean Cup (CONCACAF) was bitten by Salvadorians by American players.
Henry Romero's lawyer was the first to be distinguished.
El Salvador bit the attacker Josie Altidor, after which she pinched his chest.
Then Seren, a paralegal, bit U.S. attorney Omar Gonzalez in his fine area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Seren was disqualified for six.
The meeting itself ended with the American victory on account 2:0, passing on Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits with the help of Chelsea Manning DNA
In the center of the Gallery of Friedman in New York City, people's faces -- white, black and brown, all of which look like each other.
The 30 portraits were created by a painter named Heather Dewey-Harborg, with brush strokes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Lewenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst serves a 35-year period for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year communication between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a female transsexual and famous dissident, by whom Barack Obama moderated his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed and used a computerized DNA program from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, although difficult, manifest that not only is the plasticity of DNA data, different ways of interpreting them and the inflexible determinism of those interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, born with the name Bradley Edward, had openly stated since he was a teenager that he considered himself a woman, had been sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spearage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black and white selves, where Manning in a platinum shade of a wig, obviously feeling awkward, was driving a car; with this photograph, she was associated with it.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg completed with great success its 2012 project entitled “A stranger's Visions”.
In it, an artist made portraits of unknown people by means of forensic evidence of the type of cigarette and chewing rods, secreting DNA from this garbage, and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary presentation of a new press exhibition.
At that time Chelsea was not allowed to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison - sat muse became correspondence friends and exchanged letters for two years.
They even wrote a book by comics "Suffered Images," illustrated by Shoila Canungo, who illustrated how the president would ease Chelsea's punishment in the future and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama had really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in the military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening up right now when Donald Trump announces war to people who reveal secret information in government and invents new ways of inflamming the hostility he has to soften in Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about this time match, she said, "There's nothing happened."
The artist's statement on the gallery wall calls for an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of pencil C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientific artist expresss), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how we all look remarkably similar, in any case by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't determine what we are, how open genetic data are to be interpreted and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; its 2007 video work "False Memories" is also displayed here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibit in the same room is the novel mentioned above in the comic books.
On it, Manning, in King Kong style, appears above the U.S. Justice Cazar building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"Don't ever shut up that way."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin ants when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet -- as was seen in comic books -- but when she comes, she'll be greeted by masks in the middle of the room, her own genome symbols, assembled like a crowd of protestors.
This is also done deliberately, as is the case with everyone in the exhibition up to a height (5'2, Manning growth) where genetic hell groups were painted by the pencil.
"I'd rather put them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of Northwest University and officer of Oxford University are looking for police on charges of murder
According to police reports, there is a nationwide siege of a Northwest University professor and an Oxford University staff member who are being sought as suspects because a man killed in a luxury room in Chicago has been found in a luxury room.
According to the records of the Cook District Court, warrants were issued on Monday for pre-trial murder without the right to bail on bail of 40-year-old Vindem Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren on account of their alleged involvement in Trent G. James Cornell-Durallo's death.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duralo, aged 20, died after multiple stab wounds.
In a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several injuries on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Durallo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating the death of knife wounds as a murder, while the police are increasingly looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbah, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was prohibited from entering North West University campaigns.
“It is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwest University cooperates with the investigation”, said Kabaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Summerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with British police and are prepared to provide all necessary assistance to U.S. investigative authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
The police chief of police in Chicago, Anthony Gulelli, said he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have any idea of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing”, Gulelmi said.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gullemi, the police officer called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in number 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible one.
Gulelli reported that it was unclear whether the incident had occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the camera records confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were connected”, Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plan manual issued a statement to the residents stating: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Vice-Prime Mutko: “We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map shortly”
Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented shortly.
“A certain stage of compliance has been reached, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (the British Antidipping Agency).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map for the restoration of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSAD and has recently been published on the website of that organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that would present a problem for Russia.
"It was announced, it will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and VADA shortly,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that RussianAndidoping structures should publicly accept the results of an inquiry commissioned by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
On this issue, Mutko said, "We're investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programmes and we will not recognize what was not. "
Mutko repeated the words of Vitala Smirnova, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication Rport Smyrnov, he acknowledged the problems previously encountered in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
"No one is going to accept this report without reservation," Smirnov added.
WADA prevented RUSAD from carrying out pre-ping control in November 2015 after a pre-ping scandal.
In June this year, however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of WAD, Olivier Niggly, stated that RUSADA was “traveling in the right direction” to resume his work.
Fire extinguished in the 79th tower in Dubai
The large fire that occurred in one of the world's highest residential buildings, the Tower The Torch, has been extinguished, broadcasts Reuters.
It is noted that the fireman managed all fires by 4:00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities reported no casualties as a result of the incident.
During the fires, the surrounding streets were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
It has previously been reported that in Dubai, 79-thousand residential skyscraper The Torch is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the residents were evacuated on time.
Immortal Buzova's flickering of fans: pants that don't cover their pants.
Olga Buzova, the scandalous real-world leader of House-2, struck the viewers of the Europa Plus Live festival with panties.
In front of thousands of worshipers, a newly declared singer with Nasta Cudrey gave us a song called "We Will Be Hot."
Both girls went on stage in provocative "grunts" sewn in such a way that they saw the lower white singers.
The inscriptions of Buzova and Cudry were made on the trousers.
Previously, it was reported that changes in Buzova's appearance had been commented by a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration in relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported by Radio 4 news service on Friday, 4 August, with reference to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Gensec also criticized Russia for the Crimea situation and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and he accused the United States Congress of doing so.
Metro Ekaterinburg is developing a new way of paying
In October, the Ekaterinburg Metro will be able to pay a bank card, as stated by Paul Wedernikov, CEO of the I-See, in an interview with the District Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of subway travel as in other major cities to the 2018 World Cup: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want the fans from other countries, the Mundilla guests, to take advantage of the metropolitan with their bank cards, don't buy badges and don't stand in line," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become another Uber.
Amy Herrett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his e-commerce startup staff, but the interviews were not working.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, unspoiled.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective”, said Herrett, manager of a 75-person San Francisco company called Madison Reed, an e-commerce company in hair care.
She therefore appealed to others for help.
A new type of startup is now being developed to help companies understand how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to make express inquiries, to approach certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and a hotline for complaints and, in some cases, to allow informers to pass top management and direct to management.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City startup whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Herrett told me that she had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of using "Glint".
In addition to the express questions and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company ' s heat map and shows in visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows them to understand why.
Companies are slowly aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, who was involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a post on a blog that described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed their frustration were punished.
For startups like "Glint", it's a desire to control the situation - the opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let's talk about payments”, dedicated to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Converent's startup from Denver, Colorado, to help companies prevent and detect misconduct, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the face of the fall in Uber's reputation.
Converent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tsla.
Uber recently appeared among clients.
Like Glent, Convercent allows companies to send individual-ordered staff opinions, collect confidential real-time responses and view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the head office.
“The Court of Public Opinion has taken over power from inspectors”, said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company mistreats staff or behaves in an ethical manner, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may experience costly consequences of boycotts by clients, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinn reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with over 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for over a year to ensure that staff members were aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to approach the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or a Mail of the Office, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, director of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track complaints from staff members.
Now that the company is using Converent, the problems previously hidden from office managers in other cities or states — such as discrimination, neglect and unfair pay — can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation”, said Vitrano, who leads the risk management team of Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from court proceedings with staff”.
According to Queensland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of staff members in 2002, after the accounting firm Artur Andersen failed because of the ethical irregularities resulting from Dela Enron.
But it was only when social networks were spread that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty laundry from spreading the virus online.
“Where to begin using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy”, he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly to use their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Converent received $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the total capital of the company to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's staff are expecting more of their jobs than they used to be.
In highly competitive markets, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, these are just the minimum ones.
Staff members want to feel accepted and appreciated, and they devote their time to a positive mission company.
“When people are happy to work with a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more likely to make such a company successful,” says Nina McCuin, Vice-President for Global Benefits and Satisfactions of LinkedIn, where both Converent and Glenn are used.
Investors get income when their portfolio business goes well; companies do well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise increased commitment and involvement, it is not surprising that they find support.
It is important to have data on staff involvement, as stated by cultural professionals in the workplace.
But the data are useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff for feedback, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
And if changes don't come fast enough, or if they don't come at all, frustrations can develop, and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to hold 4,000 interviews”, says Russell Rat, president of Kotter International’s management consulting firm, who had to see companies making a mistake relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go through with it, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Don't you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Herrett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with the "Glint".
And after collecting feedback from staff members who were dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge of its staff members and hopes that in the long run, it will be able to better retain staff in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is opened in the Krasnoarmaya avenue
In Barnaul, major measures were taken to address the cause of the asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmaya avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice in the newly falsified carriageway (crossing with the Youth Streets) was decided to “discover”.
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramway was due to the fact that the land had been inhabited by a land in an area of an unexploited net.
According to Ivan Harmonat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Traffic, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for destruction.
Depending on its results, action will be taken.
It is anticipated that the deck of unharmed communications and its concreteization will need to be restored.
This is reported on the official website of the capital city.
The Bruins team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day
The time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of footballers at the University of California in Los Angeles is being delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields on the campus.
Some of them pulled off their T-shirts, exposed their sweaty backs after the busy first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes of idleness constitute a break in the middle of the day.
The players for the summer class, after three hours of training, will go back to the dorms to prepare for the final exams, and next morning will return to Wasserman's soccer center for meetings at 6:30.
Not long before Monday turned Tuesday, team coach Bruins Jim More said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for meat."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload for the players, actually extended their workday — at least until Friday exams ended.
So the start of the first three training sessions at the University of California in Los Angeles was set for 7:15 p.m. to fit them into an already heavy game schedule.
The result of the lack of two trainings a day has been more days with one exercise, and Bruins is moving the camp to begin almost a week than last year and is training during summer school for the first time in the six seasons of Mora in Veswood.
According to the schedule, they are scheduled to conduct 18 training sessions until 20 August, including the start of formal preparations for the first game in the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
Maura said that he supported a change in rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that it created another point in the player's schedule.
“For three or four days, we put this enormous burden on them, this is a severe trial,” Maura said.
"And they just beat it up, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live to Saturday and have more time, it'll be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view of the adjacent parking lot and of the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have overcome the protective net behind the gates.
Blues players have to occupy a hotel since this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," Maura said.
“It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger of anyone taking a room off, sitting there and recording the training on video.
If you have a video recording of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and park guard number 8.
We'll do whatever we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are released from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg's subway in April were released from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Vice-President Anna Mitianina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospital, transmitting the TV Center.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg's Metro was on April 3rd this year.
A suicide bomber, Aqbarjong Djalilov, blew up.
The terrorist attack resulted in the death of 15 persons, as well as the death of the perpetrator himself.
In criminal cases, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of Rosbybudsor recommended that the Metropolitan Pieter Petersburg review the transport safety plan, in particular increasing the number of metal detectors' borders.
Facebook is increasing fact-keeping in the fight against fair news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of misdemeanours to independent experts and show their conclusions under their original posts, and declared on Thursday the largest social network of the world, which is trying to combat so-called fairy-news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible thinking, to send them to the test and possibly to show the results of the fact-listing under the reference post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which so-called fair news has been disseminated, which many feel influenced the presidential elections in 2016 in the United States.
This issue is also being discussed extensively in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, while in Germany, before the September elections, support was expressed for the plan to fine social networks if they did not quickly remove hate-encouraged posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which communications are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgements about what they read and share," wrote Sara Sue, Facebook News Manager at her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "linked articles" function and work on other changes to the news feed to address the problem of fairy-trap news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze," and in the 1970s and 1980s it served as a shelter for Margaret Tatcher.
But for 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bull Valley in Kent County, he's been watching a violent story around, and now he's inspired Jamie Rods, a yorkshire-supper, and he's got a tendency to do historical work, to have a novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says excitedly.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian Era and tells of families who lived in Scotty; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkewicz, Briony May Smith, William Axley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rods' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The Dead Man's Beaks and Other Stories" -- a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the heart.
"I could have been touched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobs," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And letters always smell smoke because they lit fire at that time.
And 300 years later, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person who is so passionate about old paper, to receive support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council, and to live in a castle for four months ("For my sake, I'm a little bit in there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying Victorian Castle, walking through archives, and dealing with numerous treasures of name and old things - for example, the heads of the hyenas on walls or bottles that had been lying in the trench for centuries.
He went through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to the woodsmen, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty's castle has not been very well understood, because the National Fund was granted full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the staff had just begun to deal with the archive, which he described as "that the Aristocrats had gone to the attic for centuries."
Dancers, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what they were saying, "You think land disputes are boring," says Rods, "but two families were fighting for it.
It's like that, guys!"
In some stories, the castle collection is a starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the Workbook, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Kristian Revolution of 1381.
"There's information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called "Kent and Sassex Russian Families," says Rods.
"The peasant revolt started in these places, and I thought that rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as the Priestess, which tells of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid in their home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist," about the 18th-century smugglers Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, stoned the tomb (it was discovered several years later when the tomb was dug).
The Darrels, the beloved family of Rhodes, of all the Scotneys who lived in, "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect juxtapos, they're always in debt, and they're spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In various generations, Darrel men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women, and I represent them as a company of pretty guys who are able to look after the heirs of large states."
After the end of work at Rods Castle, other opportunities are sought for unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish silhouette, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elemyangyaki, a place where the sanatorium was at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to get back into real life."
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gasprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, withdrawals from the ARB would account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not a simple solution - all banks that have declared a break with ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks Russia, headed by a prominent politician, Anatoly Aksak, Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, recognized, by the way, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy in terms of the number of bills prepared.
The outbreak of the conflict within ARB was the subject of a debate in the Federation Council, when new bills were being considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular involving a new classification of banks according to the size of statutory capital.
At that time, Garegín Tosunyan, President of ARB, stated that it was the association ' s view that the bill was passed for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus attempting to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which Tosunyan thought was not always justified in withdrawing licences from some banks, which had indeed been objected to by the representative of the CB: many bank leaders, such as the extra-prombunka, were members of the ARB governing bodies.
This exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulatory banking environment and appears to be a clear excuse for the 15 largest banks, in disagreement with ARB policy, to begin to prepare for membership in the association “Russia”, noting that “the performance of ARBs is at a low level and there is no constructive dialogue within the banking community”.
Investors Will Be Better
What's the end?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises in or near a banking malfunction or conflict: investors do not risk anything, but rather the reliability of the banking system will increase.
It is headed by Anatoly Aksakov, who is known for his care in the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at annual meetings of the association, and all significant regulatory initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of “regionals”.
In terms of human resources and organization, there is no clear expectation of special shocks.
There is no doubt that the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants have been deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest, established in 1991, has considerable potential for continuing to improve banking legislation and the overall area of monetary treatment.
Nor can it be said that Russia's open arms association is ready to receive any new members, based on the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Akskova (“may wish too much”), who, on 21 July, at a briefing in the Parliamentary newspaper's press centre, stated that “in the very next day, representatives of banks leaving the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of building up the capacity of our association Russia”.
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of Association, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both parties are under consideration, and the agenda for the extraordinary convention of the association is being prepared, which will take place in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll be.
Also Anatoly Aqsakov, stressing that “the chair does not stick”, called the possible new leader of the updated association "Russia" Georgia Luttowski, who resigns in September as Vice-President of the Central Bank, giving a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aqsakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to suspend leave for one day and come to Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the issue of the “Russia” emergency convention.
The entry of gasoline vehicles into Russia's major cities will not be restricted
The Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nicholas Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline vehicles into Russia’s major cities would not be limited until now.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our idea is to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there's a concept of zero emissions immediately.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is: Since what year?
It's like that at the slogan level - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know if that might happen," says "Prime" to the Minister.
Formerly, the newspaper Izvedia reported that, by 17 August, the Vice-Prime Minister, Arcadiu Dvoković, had been mandated to examine proposals for possible options for electric transport masterage submitted to the Government by the Director-General of PAO Kamaz Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, the use of vehicles with ABCs in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a grandcard.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the policy of obtaining a seal card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so in the light of the change in how the United States issues credit cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
A new application process would give priority to English candidates who had money to support themselves and skills to benefit our economy,” said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should concern us.
We haven't had time to think that 2017 can't get any worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the centre of attention.
The Responsible Robots Foundation (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharki, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffil University and co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users can choose the eye color of robots, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are making fun of this, but firms are already sending out a lot of them to consumers, and we'll soon see a lot more of them," Charki said in her presentation of the new report.
Modern sex-cups evolved from their inflatable congregates to robots with silion skin warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also set up their robots by their taste by selecting everything from the color of their eyes and the shape of their nipples to the shape and colour of their nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" by which Stepford's wife would be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex-cups have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotxrobot enables users to develop the qualities they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Company, which are delivered with already programmed identity -- for example, Cold Farra gives the impression of shyness, and Baby Wendy has a "good" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," excitedly reports True Company.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't like, and so forth.
She's having a change of heart during the day, like a real man!
She may want to sleep or talk or she may be in a mood!
There's a lot of concern about sex robots -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but most of all concern about the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape, which causes the holding of the Cold (read: resistance) Farah.
On True Company, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibe, why can't men have Roxxy?" says on the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for subordination sex as an alternative supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until a free market allows them to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came about when women's rights around the world were threatened when there was a president in the White House who boasted about what was happening to women.
The most frightening thing about TV series "The servant girl's Rass show" is not graphic images, mangled bodies and crushed eyes, that's how realistic that vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The aim of the sex robots industry is to make this physical representation to real women (only with the proportion of pornography) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to be human in the sense of copying the movements of the human body.
But it's really not like the robots look like real women.
They can't break up with or get away from their partners.
They don't have their lives or their biographies, anything that might point to independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful rabbis.
Or, as they say in 2017, female servants.
A member of Los Angeles, Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been in favour of Ukraine's assembly since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which begins on 31 August.
Andrei Lebedev, the general manager of the blue-yellow portal, reported this to BeBasket.
We tried to reach out to Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with the direct participation of Jeter, the assembled Ukraine took its sixth highest place in Eurobasket-2013 and first came to the basketball World Championship, where the yellow blue failed to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. adulteress recruited 15.4 points on average, made 3 sets and gave 5 broadcasts.
Jeter has ceased to speak in favour of the assembled Ukraine since leaving the position of chief coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who resigned in 2015.
The male Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will have a promised team tournament on Earth.
The Trusted Eugenia Murzina in Group B will have five associates: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male team has conducted two tests in which Dutch and Belarusians have been awarded priority.
Tramp's great feat?
It seems very reasonable to portray Mit Romney as himself.
In the Trumpa era, it was common for political disputes that polarized the American electorate to break down some families at a micro-level.
Between Thanks Day and Christmas, U.S. newspapers sang columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all tense so we're gonna pop.
Less is said about Trump's ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to me this week in New York.
She reminded me that an alliance against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
At Trumpe, in the White House, everyone she knows, including the sister brother with whom she argued about politics for decades, suddenly and in a strange way ended up on the same side.
It's definitely good for dinner, but I can't help but think that in a wider context, it can be dangerous.
The tramp inhaled power in the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trumpe and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will be stopped from hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans who, against the backdrop of its standards, suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I realized that I miss my old-fashioned mind today, Mitt Romney, with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax declaration looks like) -- compared to Trump and both of them seem a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the central park cartel -- the biggest cartel in New York Park Department and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the pictures of the glassglass on the central drum -- the thundering clowns and the animals, who look in horror at their backs, are extremely ominous, and the dancing music is strange.
So much of the things that are known in this city are disappointing: the species of the skyscrapers are getting tired, the silhouettes of buildings are too comfortable to cause alarm, and the reality of the city is not coming up after the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day when I learned that the Suisse-cottage area is not really a Swiss helmet, but a big round intersection in North London.
And carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two is, a child of eleven and two women can spend a great time in forty.
If I could make the carousel an estimate, I'd put a five on it, but fortunately, no one asked me to do that.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to use a terminal card to evaluate my "test" purchase on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus option to accompany 15 percent of the price of tea is on the order of the counter.
As a result, not only does neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to make a personal difference in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled confoundedly while I was tired of evaluating my experience in handing her a credit card of five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pains
Pistorius is leaving prison because of his visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which the prison administration claims he received as a result of falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office against an initial sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Stankamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times through the toilet door at his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he had accepted his friend as a night thief hidden in his toilet.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has announced its intention to challenge again, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which she claims is too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that he would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria could be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeded.
South Africa has no death penalty.
A non-departure signature was selected for a suspect of beating a journalist.
Capital law enforcement officials chose a preventive measure by signing a non-departure measure for a man who attacked a NVVVT journalist, Nikit Rizjaev, during a live air from Gorkoy Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irino Walk.
“In an investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code (“Boutings”) against a 32-year-old man who struck on the person of a correspondent in a television channel in the Central Park for Culture and Recreation of the name of Gorkoy, a suspect was selected as a preventive measure in the form of non-departure and proper conduct”, Volk clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been prepared for the suspect for police disobedience.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during live airstrips, an unusual man approached the correspondent and hit his face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VCR.
On the contrary, according to Rizjaev himself, the paratroopers tried to arrest Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting, according to the TV station BBC.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia, placing tents in an unsettled area, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV station B-Ti-Vi that the Bulgarian citizens had been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened their control of the free camp and have already imposed serious fines on all who are caught while parking in a non-existent area.
The audits will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court can impose a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused U.S. Vice President of rhetoric during the cold war.
The statements made during the European tour by U.S. Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by Russian MIDA.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly moving towards primitive ideological images of the cold war, which are totally devoid of reality”, says a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
Thus, at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Pens' words about the “Russian threat” and the attempted violent cross-border efforts he had made in Podgorica were echoed.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “either with the West or with Russia” and the invisibility of the argument that the whole of South-Eastern Europe should enter NATO as an alternative.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that had violated international law by using force to avert Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Call on American colleagues to cease Russia's nephewship and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on mutual account of interests”, states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldscher was injured in an ambulance accident in Podmoskovy
The accident occurred in Stupino, where the illsher were hit by an innomarca encounter with the ambulance.
Today, about 08:10 mc was a collision between Mitsubishi and the ambulance in Stupino district of Moscow.
“As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned around”, said TASS in the MoU press service in Moscow.
There are law enforcement officers working on the accident site, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son on the construction site and turned it in a cellophone bag.
On the evening of 3 August, a local citizen reported to the Division of Police that he had found a package with a baby in an unimproved private house.
“The law enforcement and medical personnel who promptly brought the child to a medical facility” were reported to the Odessa National Police Head.
Medical researchers found that the boy was born a few hours before he was detected, as indicated by the umbilical cord.
A 36-year-old local woman has been identified as a birthright during the priority operational and investigative activities.
It has also been established that a woman has three more children.
As noted in the chapter, the law enforcement sector has not previously seen the family and has not received special attention.
Police officers are currently determining the circumstances and reasons that led to the woman ' s action, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The infant is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nicolaus, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the garbage pipeline.
Gregory Laps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 is not 30. "
One of the most successful artists of the Russian squad, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the observer of the narration.
I remember when your "tantine" came out.
A special tent in the "Lowers", Gloria Gheinor Hall for the noun, a powerful saluter over Moscow River.
You must've been pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Was it designed?
In terms of profession, it was a good time.
I've been working a lot, and I've been driving with the gastros all over the country three times, and I've been giving 120-130 concerts a year.
I've released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I'm going to say 20 years ago.
Biological clocks are not misleading.
Drinking like I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Nevertheless, I'm getting into a fight, and I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them you're recording a new album, first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it right now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What's So Serious?" on a single song that's written with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we film the video on it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
I put a good American drummer, Chris Coleman, in your new plate.
Do you think you wanted to attract him to your town hall?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the world's most outstanding drummers.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Kolson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects).
But for long-term work in Russia, they imposed, mildly speaking, excessive conditions.
This was about fees from $35,000 to $45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found Max Malishev's great drummer.
It's actually better to feed yours.
At times, I want to get one of them into a fight, not something.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov has been high on the international level.
Western music magazines are written about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't still come to the United States?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I used to say I was studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music have for 70 years been completely excluded from the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They sought as much quality as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the British and I have been denied entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to present visa papers to the British Embassy every year to be allowed to go there again, and most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is a favor to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not an order, but an official, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo has a good Sporting Hall, and I've been there one day.
Now they're invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have already been dissolved.
On "Randeva Lima Wycule," which will begin on July 20 in Jurmale, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lymea is a great singer and a great woman with the ability to present herself and her beautiful cheek, even whispering.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to look at Vladimir Wiestsky's work.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record about 80 or 90 songs of Wassoc's about the same feed as he did himself.
Just voice and guitar.
No other arrangements.
I will be sponsored by our well-known musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to involve myself in the album and Alexander Yakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it works.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenzev gradually entered his repertoire.
Maybe you'll write down the album of his stuff.
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I would cross with him and ask him if I could sing a song of him.
He said, "Grigorius, I write songs so that they may be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write an album like this.
As long as I don't have a job like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borysović doesn't object, I might be going to do that.
If you don't focus entirely on your producers' business.
I suppose before you realized his potential, you didn't sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, stand-alone people.
You mean Sergei Lazarus?
Serge is a brilliant singer, I invited him in.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And now in my center, there's Alexander Panayotov, who I led at Golos.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, these singers are rare.
It would be most regrettable if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire. I'm filming the music videos.
I hope for a good outcome.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buying them songs, paying poets, sometimes their tracks rotate television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they're going to get a recorded album, a few clicks.
And then if they want to, they can go their own way, and I'm not going to insist that they return their money.
Although I'd be happy if any of them made commercial progress and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to shut down anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, try, prove how I used to prove it.
If tomorrow you're asked to make a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
These are mainly closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I am the man of my country, the Russian, who had his own conviction flying to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say we have to fly to some other place for the benefit of the State, I'll do it.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this has happened to Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people, and we must be together.
I'm sorry it's unlikely to work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 or 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And several Ukrainian artists cooperated: Any Laurak, Light Lobod, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a great many gifted people are, and it is indeed regrettable that they are now unable to produce their full talent on a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slav Wakartchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I think it's not likely at this point...
Andreya Ohlopkova was transferred from the cosmodrome.
As has become known, the technical director of the East Andrei Ohlopkov cosmodrome began work at the Khrunićev State Space Research and Production Centre (HKNPC).
In the past, he had worked de facto on the construction of the East Cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Operations Centre (CENCI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Fields, where the coordination of production would take place.
Mr. Olopkov will not have a successor: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the functional function is scattered from the NCCI offices.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of the CENCI for Technology Development, Andrei Olopecov, had moved to work in KNPC Khrunitzev, the top managers of several space industries, as well as a government officer.
"He's been working for a new post for weeks," the industry's interlocutors have clarified.
The CENKI could not receive an operational comment on Thursday, and Mr. Olopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information “Sudden” has been officially confirmed in SKNSC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, said at the enterprise. Andrei Olopkovi fully fulfilled the task of providing the launch minimum for the first launch on the launch site of the East Cosmodrome.
Mr. Ohlopkov went to work in CENKI in 2013, serving behind his shoulders in space troops, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plescki he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a member of the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery, allegedly since his submission, regional businessmen had been paid for the pumping of State orders but had failed to meet the obligations undertaken to clean up separate parts of the launch vehicles in the Archangelian region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technical development responsibilities assigned to it in the CENI were extended to various projects, but the main project was the construction of a long-range launch site in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Statpenko, in an interview with “Sudden” expressly stated that the situation in Eastern “was critical as early as October 2013”.
The case is that a strategic error was made in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Souz-2 launch vehicle was planned for the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, CENCI specialists began to maintain parallel installation of technology equipment in unstructured facilities.
Andrei Ohlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks involved and the transfer that occurred (in place of December 2015 the Union took off only on 28 April 2016), this idea was justified, says the source of "sudden" on the cosmodrome: “Unless we would still have done nothing from the East, we would have built it”.
The vice-premier, Dmitriy Rogozin, who is responsible for the launch of the launch of the launch site, jokingly referred to Andreya Olopkov as his “space Susunin” but he almost always requested information about the construction process.
Mr. Ohlopkov was remembered and straight: for example, in an interview with the Bhop, he proposed that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spest) be removed from the status of the only East Executive and work directly with the subcontractors, "Why should we put all the eggs in one Specialstroe basket?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to Mr. Ohlopkov, Mr. Olopkov's transition to a new place of work led to disagreements with the management of CECI on how to complete the construction of cosmodrome structures and complexes, as well as on working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for everyone," said one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government officer, in turn, calls the decision odd: “He was one of the best professionals to find an equivalent replacement.”
According to the data, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the launch site will be abolished and its functions will be dispersed from the NCCI units.
There will be a two-skills programme in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two skills at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the department of science and education of Saintslaw Goloubenko, this can be done by re-reading recurrent subjects to students, and the issue of paying for other second-skills classes is solved by means of special grants, which is passed on by the RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we will, together with the expert community, develop a mechanism that will allow two occupations to take place, but at the same time will not conflict with existing legislation in the field of education”, said Golubenko.
Last Friday, at the Sunday Talk, Vladimir Putin, with her children's centre, Sirius, a student, Maria Andreev, reported that she had to pay for recurrent items in the second CMM at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying violin and piano classes and had prizes in both directions.
The Head of State had recognized her question as very relevant and had promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was detained on the skyscraper wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Kirill N., who has climbed the roof of a tall building, reports El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City's capital.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and himself took over one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
The young man was already being detained on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security has released him on a helicopter.
He was subsequently sent to the National Institute for Migration.
There it finds out whether a young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man who was on high has become popular in the Network.
Users called the boy "a spider man."
According to the media, such experiments are Hobbies to him.
Red meat, milk products, and chocolate can help to facilitate the OVC.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered nightmares for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest that diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help to ease the symptoms of those suffering from intestinal inflammation.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, resulting in cramps and stomach swelling, chronic or blood loss, loss of weight, and extreme fatigue.
While it is generally recommended that patients avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of the triptophen protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestines keep harmful germs from entering the body.
Cells capable of firing are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too severe for inflammation, this may lead to intestinal inflammation.
The experiments showed that mice with certain bacteria in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs triptofan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to launch these cells.
Professor Colónna said, "We have established a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillas reuteri - which is part of the normal microbiom of the intestine, and the development of cell populations that increase tolerance.
The more triptofane was contained in mice' diet, the more immunized cells they had."
He suggested that the same thing would work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and the rich tryptofan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Servantes-Barragánvas, after studying the variety of immune cell tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by intestinal microbiomes -- bacteria, viruses and fungi communities that usually live in the stomach and intestine tract.
The DNA of the mouse intestine cells was separated, and six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but were missing from mice without them.
Muscles grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiom and did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri, and their immune cells came into existence.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew up L. reutersi in a liquid medium and then transferred small amounts of liquid, without bacteria, to uninformed immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of triptofane processing known as indo-3-milic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofane in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptofane was halved, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Servantes-Barragán explains that people have the same higher cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reutersi in our stomach tract.
It is not known whether by-products of triptofane from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans just like mice, but people suffering from intestinal inflammation have been diagnosed with defects in the genes associated with triptofane.
She says, "Maybe we need to strengthen these cells because these cells depend on burning processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of triptofane with L. reuteri may potentially increase their population.”
In the opinion of José Mourinho, Manchester United hired Némania Matić
Manchester United has hired Némania Matić in the name of Nemania, and considers José Mourinho after the paralegal debuted in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, purchased for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a victory of 2-1 in Dublin in the last presequential match of UEFA against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression of being a paralegal, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke through when they were given a sense of urgency.
However, since Matić did not participate in the pre-seuse tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and he had to endure only 45 minutes, which Mourenia said required further work before the start of the pre-Phigue season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius in how he thinks, he thinks football," said Moureen.
“We will help him prepare sooner than later.”
Like Matić, his new comrades, Victor Lindeloff and Romela Lukak, started playing at Aviv's stadium when Mourenia started forming his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourenia wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four,” he added.
“I will rejoice even more if they get me four out of four, but they have already done a great job for me.”
Former leaders of the social democracy of Lithuania are forcing them to remain in the ruling coalition.
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-Primencies Algiardas Butkjavius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas of the Social Democratics, Cheslovas Jurchenas, appealed to the members of the Allies to remain in the ruling coalition.
The Parliament Gazette reported that because of tensions with partners - the Union of peasants and Greens - the Social Democratic Party had initiated a discussion about whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
There are three senior experienced comrades who have written open letters to the same party, saying, inter alia: “It is understandable that the party's frustration with the results of the election, but the coalition with the peasants has created conditions for us to pursue the goals of social justice, which we have initiated in the Government's programme, and to maintain the political domination of the left centre over the right parties.”
In the view of former party leaders, the discussion “has so far acquired an emotional expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors fear that the thoughtless actions of their party may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
Disabled Antônio Mamavi has been fined
Mosgord reduced the sentence for the wheelchair disabled Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Previously, a convicted person had been released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirosev court.
Mosgorud, however, confirmed that the accused was a criminal, as he had organized the robbery and abduction of a motorist from a former intelligence soldier.
Mosgord reduced Anton Mamav’s sentence to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the offence, and therefore such a person must be prosecuted”, explained Mosgorood Spokesperson Uljan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the state of maternal health, the factual circumstances of the case and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, which provides that punishment may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamav Vasili Serostova, the court did not determine the circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of gravity of the act and to a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with the Mosgor court decision.
I'm disappointed with the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intent on fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal of the sentence before the Court of Cassation of Mosgorso and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said.
Recall that 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a member of the criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled man claims to have bought a motorist from friends for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motorists, including the former Special Forces fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant Vasili Serostov had taken their property away from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Moscow District Court sentenced Vasili Serostova to three years ' imprisonment and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony (art. 162, para.
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatyana Moskalkov, was involved.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timyravian court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorous.
NPF will prepare a report on the environment for the President
The Final Forum of Action of the Pan-Russian People's Front (ONF) will be devoted to environmental issues in 2017, reported to the NPF sources and confirmed to the Chief Executive of Alexei Animov.
He said that, as a result of the French Forum, it was planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental problems and to propose a strategy to address them.
The interlocutors of the NUF note that the report of the Head of State will contain “deep analysis” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the Report, the final FNF Forum will be held in the fall.
The exact date for this exercise has not yet been determined - it tends to be adjusted to the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key activities of the FNL.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buratia Ulad.
On the basis of the proposals that were put forward and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and spoke to the NPF interlocutors.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Movement of Olga Timofev, who chaired the State Committee on Environment and Environment, reported that the “front founders” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of the Environment in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the NPF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
During the year, we grew up a powerful team of environmental experts, saw legislative gaps, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of a report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the paper also reports on the work on the priority NPF projects, which was presented to Olga Timofev's “Evidences”.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the Forum.
He had previously participated in the OPF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of the Environment will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for years.
To prevent these issues from falling on the agenda, Olga Timofev added.
Andrey Kolyadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that in raising environmental issues, the NPF is working on the presidential agenda.
Many things they have proposed as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President,” said Andrey Kolyadin, “to the reporters.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the NPF, the regions will be able to address not only their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a garbage dump in Balashhya (then closed) and about coal dust at the port of the town of Nadashka (formerly a bill banning the open trans-shipment of coal in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for dealing with environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established; the question is to continue law enforcement as well as civil society positions.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is required, according to Leonid Bochin, head of the environmental fund.
Member of the HRC, Head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergey Ziplenkokov, in his conversation with the “Evidences”, stressed that responsible social and business approaches are necessary to successfully solve environmental problems, and that legislative efforts alone are not sufficient.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much better step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, said Sergey Tsplenkokov.
The expert stressed the need to reverse the trend that breaches of environmental legislation were economical solutions for business.
A British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and a car with his hands up.
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, go into the office, and even run a car with a simple arm.
The 30-year-old Stephen Northham used a tiny chip between his thumbs and his indexes and now, through his BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives on the basis of technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal Prince's in Winchester, to ensure that the implementation procedure is conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in houses and cars with 300 pounds for one lock.
The married father of a child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
A report for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine TIMME, the White House’s decision last month to force a Marine helicopter into the South Lawn on an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The White Sikorski VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, became a central element of an event in the White House on 17 July at which American construction programmes were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and the White House senior officials have examined technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter in Connecticut was taken out by a boat from Man's State, a fire truck from Vicensensin and a heavy truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), the White House Military Office ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to know that you were aware because it was an unusually widely publicized event in the press,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, the first Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, prior to the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event appointed at 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn was released between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that, if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for return flights, in accordance with the restrictions on hours of work.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event and the unit ' s security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the records received by TIME whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the activity was contrary to the order.
“We asked, among other things, if the Hetch Act was in violation and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go”, the deputy said.
The event “Docile in America” was declared official by the White House, and has not been covered by Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote health reform, which was then under development in the Senate, and commended efforts to regulate government regulations.
Use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly new.
The presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them only in the interests of photo-capacity.
The Trump had already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane had passed in the background during its first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account was overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor.
“The White House is delighted with the presentation of products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around Washington Agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training missions at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the American Operation was recorded to the crew on the required training flights per month.
The units also flew 11 additional hours on that day under the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, no other exhibit presented at the event was charged to taxpayers.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in a demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defence timeline for fiscal year 2017, the rate of reimbursement to the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records 30 minutes of flying time in the air each way from its air base airport at the Quantico Marine Aeronautics Base in Virginia.
The White House states that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“It is completely wrong to calculate the value of taxpayers on the basis of an estimated rate of reimbursement,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual appropriation.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spyser, spoke out in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea of showing this week things done in America”, said Spyser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked so hard on.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump was involved with the helicopter while looking at the South Lawn during the event, but he was clearly sitting on the driver's seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorski representatives to the press about his own fleet of company products.
“I know "Sikorsky very well," said the President. “I have three of them.”
Moscow will provide grants for the intensive care units of urban hospitals
Every year, life insurance grants will be allocated to intensive care units in the capital health clinics.
Funds will be sent to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobjan, visited the Juda City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of appreciation to the Traumatician Orthopedic physician Victor Procco, who was led by the most difficult operation of re-establishing the steps of the adolescent.
Sergey Sobian also reported on the decision to allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units each year.
Funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital grant clinic, Yudn’s clinic is currently one of the largest hospitals in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Colorado Rural Hospital.
There are currently over 1,000 units of the health-care facility.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital facilities, there are day offices.
The hospital staff is 2,800.
The total area occupied by health care is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the health institution became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term accommodation units (SCP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Surgeons use advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce the recovery time of patients.
After surgery, they spend only a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with permanent medical care at a clinical hospital named Yudna.
Medical staff carried out 158 operations of various degrees of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbanka
In Nazbanka, Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no requests to purchase a Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbanka.
On Friday, 4 August, TASS refers to the representative of the press service of the UBU.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017 a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokokeni, to agree on an intermediated (through Paritbank) acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
“No documents have been received from other potential investors to purchase Sberbank shares in the NSA”, the communication states.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokorenia, withdrew an application for purchase of a daughter-in-law of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it became known that Nazbank Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Said Güzeriev and Grigoria Guselnikov the acquisition of a Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by failing to provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company last March.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guzeriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guzeriyev.
Sanctions against the “daughter” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of mother organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, as stated in the United Nations.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, have spoken on Wednesday to the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for elections to provincial councils, three women are fighting for the post of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overrated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to provincial councils and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened to disrupt the electoral process, which coincided with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In this year ' s elections, power is for the first time transferred peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Hayes stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, tickets for misconduct were tightened for tourists
The Venice authorities tightened the penalties for buying in canals from Euro50 to Euro500.
For walking around the city in a bather or with a naked tortoise, a fine of 200 euros will now be imposed.

The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Veterans ’ Tourism Adviser, Paula Mar, fines will be transmitted to the home country embassies of violators in order to warn their compatriots of such errors.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she remarked.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the traffic.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 visitors were allowed to attend.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new fast-food hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

The FF released Lake Head of Committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement made by Victor Lakerov, Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, and dismissed him from his post.
He's a senator from Khabarov's province.
An application for release from the post of Lakeers wrote last week.
He explained his decision to rotate and his desire to “change the pace of life”.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) for the establishment of fair tariffs for electricity consumers have begun to bear fruit for decades.
The cost of electricity at low voltage for industrial recipients has been decreasing by 25 per cent since 1 September.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation on amending the Regulations of the Wholesale Market of Electrical Energy and Power and the Consolidated Projected Balance of the Production and Supply of Electrical Energy (Strategy) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System on the subjects of the Russian Federation (No. 842), established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for drilling producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have broken down the thresholds of Moscow ' s Cabinets in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with anthrax of hydropower stations in Angara, which comes from Baikal, the main catchment area of which is Buryatia.
And it was not until this year that progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by decision of the Federal Government in the wholesale market price area list, the characteristics of the wholesale and retail markets are in turn among industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the people of Irkutsk region pay for kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares mention at least the approximate date of new tariff movements downwards for Buryat.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Colossal Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the manager of the McVitie's bisque manufacturer in relation to his long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The GMB Scotland office reports that the company was silent about future investments at the Volkros facility.
More than 500 people work in a factory producing, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, the owner of McVitiie's, reports that over the past few years, he has invested more than £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any change in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “are the first to know them”.
In a letter to the head of the company owned by the GMB, the Scottish branch of the GMB demanded McVite's response to concerns that funding would not be launched for the upgrading of production lines.
The chief organizer, Drew Duffy, stated: “Our trade union members are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the facility on business needs and the investment plan on the Tolcross' future.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is large in local society and in the Greater Glasgow area; this is a crucial pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and from the background of Breczit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic loss of production, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, “The manager of a Volkros facility just yesterday received a letter from the GMB Scottish office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tokros with staff members and representatives of the GMB, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We have talked to staff about how as all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions — and this is true of all our facilities and activities — to remain competitive.
“We have invested more than £5 million in recent years in our Volkros facility, especially in production lines and performance improvements.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolsross as a production facility, and if any changes are made in this facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosneffti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the East Petroleum Company (HNPC) should be connected by Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but that Gazprom, like Rosneffti, would not be given any instructions.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between “Roseftu” and “Gazprom” must be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Formerly, Igor Sechin, chapter of "Rosneffti", at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gasprom on gas for WNHC would jeopardize the project's implementation.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gasprom on this issue was ongoing.
"Gazprom" suggests finding gas resources from the perimeter of "Rosneffti," but we don't have such resources," adds Sechin.
Recall that Rosnepht asked for permission to use gas from the Kyrenia “Gazprom” deposit on the Sakhalin shelf for a “east petrochemical company”.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue were ongoing and there were no “sharp corners”.
Has the “PW” “Barcelon” warned of Neimar's transition three years ago?
The member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verrati
Parry St. Herman will not stop persecuting Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona of the world record of the raid that took place three years ago?
The compensation proposal reactivated the summer transmission window when the League 1 Club was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neimar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paid professional athlete, as SPA offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona, rather than violence from the way the proposal was put forward, and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that the source, close to the management of the Catalan club, insists that the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world been warned of such an opportunity three years ago by the President of SWW?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the recruitment of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players, SPM.
“I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will speak against them, and we will make proposals to their players,” Al-Khalaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Barcelona appears to have crossed this line when a Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in Marco Verrati's para-protector.
SWW made it clear that it would not release the Italian player on no terms, and it is likely that Barcelona now feels the consequences of its proposal in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
