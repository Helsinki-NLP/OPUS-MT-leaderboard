FANO Russian Federation will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will co-host the third Expert Session “Assessment of the Performance of Scientific Organizations”.
The Assembly will be the final part of the Agency's series of meetings during the year, as reported in a press release entitled “Lenta.Ru”.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form an outcome list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
The participants are planning to discuss rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of scientific groups and criteria for the conduct of evaluations.
The third expert session will conclude with an event to develop a common approach for all three academic institutes to the methodology of assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
We have succeeded in doing so over the past five months, and the final version of the normative documents is in the process of being harmonized.
At the conclusion of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation,” said the head of the FANO-analyzing Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Axenov.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
It is expected to result in the adoption of a resolution.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at Moscow City, Solianca Street, home 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the disturbing confusion and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will allow the stars to be tracked in a similar way, that is, arising from one cluster.
The authors published their studies in Nature magazine and are available briefly on the University website.
The same chemical composition of the nearest stars is due to the disturbing mixing of the clouds of gas prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves a star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of origin.
Previously, scientists doubted that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from those of relatives in the cluster.
Modelling by astrophysicists shows that such differences should not occur.
In their study, experts using supercomputers modeled two inter-star gas streams that together formed clouds.
This object has been transformed into a cluster for several million years under its own gravity, where proto-stars begin to form.
Scientists added paint marks to the original gas currents and found that rapid worried mixing in the clouds results in a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for biological stars by chemical composition and to identify possible regions of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after pursuing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h high-speed zone and through the bushland to escape from the Pyllbar police.
The Carrat police patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning by discovering that it reached 125 km/h when he left the Batgate Road service station.
The police report that the rider did not stop and continued his movement over Burgess Road, then hurled him into the Bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and the driver’s description were observed next to the house on Walcott Way in Bulgar.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.
He must appear before the world court of Carrata on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Judge Lady Ray appointed a hearing before the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not "tie the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave WTO
Russia will not "blow the door" in connection with new sanctions.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, spoke today to students and teachers of the MGMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russia sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to the cotton door, such as insults that have been misinterpreted, said the Minister.
We will, first of all, draw away from our interests, our interests in protecting our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners in order to ensure their adequacy, coherence and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be judged very well by the partners, and the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation has continued.
If they're saying that they're going to hurt us too, but we're going to have to do it to punish Russia, it's probably not good enough.
With regard to WTO, the withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions was not possible.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is a discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of impinging and anti-dumping measures have been applied against the economic sectors of the Russian Federation.
“We are prepared to engage WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the EU’s third energy package should not be applied retroactively”, said Lavrov.
How to use cheese properly in garden design?
Irina Okunov is answering questions:
Since sirens lose their basic appeal after blooming, it is desirable to plant them together with other shrubs.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
At the same time, it is possible and necessary to plant plants that are ornamental at other times and that are colorful at the same time.
Another plus siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stamba tree of various heights, enhanced by a bush, a bush with a broad base, or even a likeness of a garden bonsai tree with an amazingly curved trunk.
Just pick a shape that fits your garden design more closely.
In Karelia, a Leningrad resident was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to reports in the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Oluntsk and Séguézhé district.
In addition to Kareliya, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Volochova region, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
The man was later brought before the Oluntsk District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was phased out in Séguéjé.
In the course of the investigation, it has been proved guilty of several episodes of counterfeit money sales relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, criminal proceedings were brought before the courts.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with that of a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that during the past week, two other counterfeiters were convicted of paying for their counterfeit money at the stores of Petrozavoska.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been imprisoned for five years, the other for four years.
Each has a fine of 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first horse, "Derwish."
The meeting at the district center was dedicated to the first Arctic horse.
Darwish delivered U.S. and British military assistance to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, a memorial meeting was held in a monument to a future monument to the northern convoys, located on the coast name of Cedova in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of Veterans' organizations, Archangelsk, children of the Cadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a celebration, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned to the sea," noted Boris Carpow, Chairman of the North Sea Warden Veterans Council.
The event was followed by an orchestra of the city, and the Cadet class teachers gave the veterans flowers and marches with Russian flags and a victory sign.
The meeting ended with putting flowers on the mortgage.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formed shoes, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were also on board: 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrickin fighter aircraft in disassembly condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 British VMF ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The ship ' s caravan was not found by the enemy and reached its destination safely, Archangelsk.
A total of 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations were killed by 126 transport vehicles and about 50 military vessels.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressers Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill on which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Minnesota democracy, who is co-chaired by the Congress of Progressive Faction.
That's why I'm proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act along with the civil rights symbol John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by halting the forces of trade union opponents
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers facing discrimination in the organization of trade unions to seek justice before civil courts, and to receive compensation and fines, a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the Bill's co-sponsors are to think about a very American idea.
Despite attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that was still remembered by millions of Americans when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Tozo ' s paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized “the right of workers to organize, negotiate and act collectively”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or activity.
Agreements which restrict or attempt to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures to that effect will be considered illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the Organization of United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “every one has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend his or her interests”.
For generations, Americans have adopted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions and that the trade union should be protected as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is truly wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and hear their voices in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the living standards of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and have raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should be.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights — and the expansion of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations — is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters said he would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Luiziana Bobby Ginadol in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would have been required to receive patients at the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions to date, continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to take action on their terms of office," wrote Judge John DeGrevells in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within a month at which the judge will render a more permanent decision under this law.
The advocates of the right to abortion were pleased to meet this decision, the latest one against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital treatment.
“The present decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a surrogate law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed an action to suspend the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not been complainants in the case and whether they had applied for admission.
Louisiana is located in 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the medical point of view.
Abortors object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive impact on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has a hospital reception authority, reported to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the remaining doctors in the state were to be forced to stop doing this procedure, the doctor would, for fear of his safety, stop doing so, reported to the team.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for decision-making power were pending.
The introduction of quotas on domestic products will lead to what
At least half of the products for each type of product in the trade chain must be Russian production, according to Oleg Nilov, a member of the State Party of Fair Russia.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writing the newspaper Izvedia.
The document will still be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
For the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the Riitler would have to provide at least half of his regiment to domestic producers,” reported the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article on the basics of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, which set a lower rate of 10 per cent for the production of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of the incentive package for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic products on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, as the experts say.
According to Professor of Taxologik, a member of the Public Duma Independent Expert Centre, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
It's going to be good for farmers, farmers, small stores.
They'll be able to sell more, which means profit's going to increase.
They will also have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the Ritlers, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase the budget income, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some faster development, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, indeed, not immediately,” the expert notes.
In the past, Russian enterprises had often been unable to break into local shops because of high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be available after all the necessary arrangements and sanitary checks on the Russian market.
In other words, now is the moment of the moment when the former players are gone and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, there is an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in the prices of finished products,” said AIF.ru, first Vice-President of the Russian General Public Organization, the Russian Financial Directors' Club, K.E. Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would strengthen the sector by local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that, through subsidies from another State, were cheaper.
In other words, the buyer's struggle will be launched between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, notes Kasyanova, Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots in no way in all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to “retract” the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there is growing fear that poor goods will be delivered to the counters.
It may be that foreign products with broken labels will be produced in Russia,” adds the expert.
Large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers, will have a negative effect on the introduction of quotas.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer under such a schedule, as demand for their products will decrease.
Lithuania does not exclude that the law on quotas on domestic goods can affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some Russian products may give up on the quality of import analogies, while shops may be able to charge the price of the second product as a deficit.
In the early 2000s, economists again spoke about the idea of imports in February this year because of the continued devaluation of rubles.
The issue of non-importing of imported products is now becoming even more urgent, given the difficult relationship with the West.
The law is intended to require Ritellers to consider suppliers to be domestic producers when making orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to imports, and the production planning system for the required products will be established in a shorter time frame,” says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, such as the milk industry, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are truly capable of covering the counters of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can generate a strong pulse.
The largest share of imports is known to be retained for beef, ranging from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out 65 to 70 percent are Russian products," Kasyanova says.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products helps to facilitate import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, this initiative does not in itself lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, I am sure of Litwinko.
In any case, 50 per cent of goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad, and thus full imports would not take place, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
In addition, there is little to establish quotas; there is still a need for domestic products to be produced in the country to meet these quotas.
The quotas are just such guarantees and will provide," notes the expert.
The late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother’s memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural Australian women face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers have analysed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
Senior researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Studies, QIMR Berghofer, reported that the likelihood of dying during the study is 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote states than for those living in urban areas.
NEAR STUDIES: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that women's age at the time of diagnosis, ovarian cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected their chances of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they're mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and programmes to support people receiving treatment far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tino Read to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at 33 years of age, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elysa Nev, was told that she had an aggressive form of ov cancer.
A new FAP will open doors in September in the Kugener district
Construction of a health facility in the village of Tokaybelac was initiated in April this year and was under way for a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Directorate of Public Relations and Information, Head Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was provided by means of the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility is almost 230 square metres.
Health care will be provided to the inhabitants of eight settlements: Tokybeliak and Dementievo, Puncherümal, Tunja, Fomić, Toraybeliak, Shinir and Chascal.
The new health facility will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its facilities are not in accordance with sanitary requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in a cold state of newcomer will be brought to justice
A Chuvashi woman will be on the dock for killing her own child.
In Cheboxarah, a criminal investigation was completed against a 31-year-old woman in Novočeboksarska accused of causing death due to negligence.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with the four-month-old son, arrived to celebrate the birthday of the child of her kuma in Cheboxara.
After a long stay, the newcomer decided to stay with her and make the baby sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the uncircuit woman placed him next to her on the bed to feed her breast but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son, killing him by suffocation.
A criminal case, reports the SPKS press service to Chuvashiya, is referred to the court.
Inflation is off leave.
Does Russia feel a sharp rise in prices?
The cross-border sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West will accelerate inflation in Russia and fail to meet the expectations of the authorities, and are convinced of the “VTB Capital” analysts.
Experts believe that the delayed effects of anti-sanctions would lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing RBC Daily.
According to the latest projection, the rate of inflation is 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014, and the rate of inflation is 6.5 per cent in the following year, with a decrease of 6.5 per cent in the next year.
However, according to Commersant newspaper, this week the IED is expected to make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower its estimate of inflation for 2015, which would eliminate the expected overemphasizing of the population ' s income growth.
It was projected that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in effect for a year, until August 2015.
How could such inflation be assumed?
The current situation involves a one-off shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said a newspaper source in Minsk.
Inflation expectations of the Government's financial and economic bloc are not shared by WTB Capital economists and prices are projected to rise by 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will be, together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SNP) in 2015 in the regions of the Russian Federation, convinced experts.
9 per cent of inflation would have to take place in February, after which annual price increases would go down, according to experts.
By the way, last week Rosstat summarized the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “cautious sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and clarified their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of FC AForex Analysis Department:
Price increases have already been observed in the main segments of the product.
Moreover, when socially important products were valued, the Government had to launch systematic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risks of unjustifiable short-term price increases.
Vendors and Ritlers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators to ensure that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the tremendous rate of capital outflow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megageophone, internal conversion due to the population ' s flight to foreign currency, and the embargo on food imports from the countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If the inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of a minimum package basket would not have jumped 12 per cent per quarter.
The prohibition on the import of food products had created a shock of supply in the domestic market and had led to a very logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of importability at the current stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to pose the risks of growth of the inflationary component.
In addition to the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Routvev, Director, Alpari Analysis Department
During the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached between 20 and 30 per cent per month and was also zero at the current level, another point being that it was offset by rapid economic growth.
Inflation is expected to be between 8 and 8.5 per cent at the end of the year.
Plato Maguta, the asset manager of the UK Foundation Maguta
The external factor related to the sanctions against Russia is still being successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, particularly on the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and inflationary expectations of the population, which are traditionally expressed in the purchase of cash to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the FA and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth reduction of rube, both by market methods and by State regulation.
But price increases have traditionally begun after summer’s rest and may become more tangible in the fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is likely to withstand 7.5 per cent, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres mourn the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, owing to the exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners below 35 years of age, may result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds per year when today's young consumers reach the “main age of horticulture”, according to a study by HTA reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, renters spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It refers to the increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalt in front of a parking house and the reduction of the size of a garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be ?5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain's lowest level of spending on household garden goods.
HTA and Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and the lack of garden space did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener at RHS, said, "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retail trade for horticultural goods, as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather following the adverse conditions of March and April last year.

It turned out that on Friday two of the three executive directors of the fund had been replaced.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatyana Angelov, who had been responsible for the State assistance and SAPARD programme up to this time, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I didn't attend the fund board, because by law we weren't members of the management, but I was informed later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal isn't reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I learn more on Monday," said Angelov's publication.
Her seat will be occupied by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the director of Investment Credit at the central fund at Landedela in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nicolai Dachev, was also released.
Up until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU fields.
He will be appointed to his place by Ziviko Zivkov, who was the head of the District Directorate of the Landada Foundation in the city of Magio Tinkovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atija Alieva Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls an American diplomat for a report of espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has convened the highest American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bulent, reported that the American suspect and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet Journal The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for United States and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Reggie Taip Erdogan, President of Turkey, downplayed the importance of this report by saying that all major countries were spying on one another.
Previously reported information that the German chief intelligence agency had also made Ankara a subject of exploration has given rise to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies have united against Alabama
China's companies, among which China's largest commercial real estate broker, Dalian Wanda Group, and the Tennt Holdings Internet Selectives (society, Messinger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are establishing a company that will compete on the market with Alabama on-line trade.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of Major
Companies plan to invest 5 billion Yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, reports Wanda Group.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
JS will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tenent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda manages at least 49 commercial real estates throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qindoo (city in eastern China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors per year and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American AMC Entertainment Holdings Network, which makes the company the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its commercial centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dun Tze, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of e-commerce users from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest on-line-to-offline platform, notes Dun Ze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) business is to attract buyers on the Internet to come to regular off-line shops or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest pie in online commerce”, stated Wanda Wan Jianlin, leader.
“There is no real O2O site in China at present, and in this situation everyone has approximately equal chances,” he says.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will grow more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion by the year 2011.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, with Bloomberg producing official statistics: that is more of the population of any country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that by the year 2015, this number may have grown to 850 million.
Union of the wealthiest
The head of Tenent Ma Huaten was until recently China's richest man, but according to the Blogberg Agency's millionaire index, Aliba Jack Ma's founder had already defeated him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's status is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is due to his share in Alibaba.
Baidu Robin Lee now ranks third among China's richest people, whereas Van Jianlin, Wanda, is fourth-line rating.
"In this battle, it's very interesting to see three of the richest people join together to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of China's e-commerce research centre in Hanzhou Tsao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba as soon as it is established, "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not just about competing with new companies, but also with well-deserved leaders of the world’s Internet trade, is evidenced by the previous report on the financial performance of Alabama in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
The net return of Alibaba over a period of almost twice that of competitors has increased almost three times that of each year to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg on the report of an analyst from Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's update on the United States Security and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of company services in July was 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions during the last quarter were on mobile devices.
The value of its shares before IPO is to be called Alibaba.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the sources of Blogberg, the Aliba debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be held on 16 September.
Road show is starting on 3 September before the event.
It is expected that Alibaba's exit to IPO will be the record of NYSE's history and that the company will attract about $20 billion.
To date, the Visa payment system had been the record of the United States exchange of funds, which had initially located its shares in 2008 at a cost of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food items in the trade networks should be Russian production, and members of the State Duma considered them to be.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
This is a matter of amending article 8 of the Code of Taxes on the basics of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products produced in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be “scathed” to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Code of Taxes of the Russian Federation, which establishes a lower rate of 10 per cent for the sale of all food products of which Russia is the country of origin, reports the newspaper Izvediya.
On 27 August, a draft law amending the FM “On retail markets” was introduced to the lower House of Parliament, which suggests re-establishing farmers markets in Russia where small producers can produce their products.
The Chief of Police of Magaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the Kalvia municipality at the Malorca State Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Head of the Calvin Police in Malorca resort was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalously-known Magalufa drinking centre.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by a number of businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Melorca Diario's daily online report, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the city of Calvia to the Malorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard for allegations of corruption and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled owners of night clubs said that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on the state of their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," said one businessman.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Mahlauf came into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who was making 24 men pass by while running on bars.
The island authorities have since tried to put an end to bullying among the rest of the Magalouf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Karnage bar run together were fined for YA 55,000 ($73,000).
The Madalouf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous alcohol-related accidents associated with insane entertainment, known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcon to the hotel basin.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WENA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide’s Aeroport.
A further 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., after 6.6 mm, which fell during the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short downpours, including a storm, which started shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the early spring season was released last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in town.
The school conditions were expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it was in the wind-turn zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance - and had to gain height.
Wind blasts reached 50 km/h on land at the Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight records showed that the aircraft had to gain height during the second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed about 8:40 a.m.
The delay of the voyage caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday, with a probability of one or two rain showers.
Calculation of the estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control over pricing, building industry regulation and connectivity issues.
The FAS has established an expert council on building competition.
At its meeting, the head of the control office of the FAC, construction and natural resources of FAS Vadim Solovev stated that “the present calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is completely unclear”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing imprecise and can lead to an unreasonable cost of construction, considered by the FAS.
And they propose the cost of building public facilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, constructive solutions instead of the standards applied today and the single costs of technology operations.
These proposals are included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the mine.
“Replacement of traditional construction estimates for design elements should result in less corruption in the industry,” explained VGB, Vadim Solovev.
Because the estimates now count every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes bad construction companies may bury “whole tractors” in the documentation.
In the M.A.F.S.A., I agree.
“The first work on the change in cost by design elements is already under way: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of the design decisions, and to estimate the indicators,” said “WGB” by Elena Zhukov, Chief, Department of Urban Development and Architecture.
Road construction is selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As Profi Investor Chief Anatoly Demianco explained, the estimated standards have long become obsolete, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed calculations on design elements, this is difficult in practice, since buildings are often used in very different ways”, he says.
It's no secret that design develops in a lot of ways because of the state ministry.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, President of the NP, the “Expert Community of State Professionals” is now the most capable employer to pay.
The deputy director of the industrial capital centre, Rosatom Vladimir Malahov, noted that today the market is tentatively divided into companies with access to the portfolio of contracts and companies with monopoly competences that do not allow competitors to do so.
He considered that the establishment of a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was best protected from someone's influence.
At the expert board, it was suggested that a system of state administration should be established so that the same perpetrator could not obtain more than one contract worth more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion roubles.
In the ministros, this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a gene contractor, resulting in an increase in the number of customers and in the budget for its maintenance.
In doing so, the customer's specialists will have to have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations and their safety.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the overall safety of the facility.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified public buyers for lack of interest in the receipt of a state-owned part-time contract and a small amount of contract.
The Chiefs of the Expert Advisory and Resource Centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustachenkokov, believe that the State party's procedure has now become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And cited this example: “Participant in completing the application should specify “specific indicators” without specifying the words “or equivalent”, “should be”, “be”, “be greater”, “be greater”, “be less”, “be less”, “analog,” “or”, “type”,“not lower”, “be lower”, “be lower”, “be higher”, “may have”, “may be”, “be”, “not earlier”, “not higher”, “not allowed”, “not permitted”, “not permitted”, etc.
Therefore, employers often abuse their authority to impose requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem, according to Eustachenkokov, was the need to assess the quality of work at the time of application through the participant's paper proposal.
In considering the application of the participant, it is realistic to assess only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been undertaken, the expert considers it.
The quality of work can only be assessed when accepted.
The expert board also requested that the value-of- Name income be transferred from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the State Secretary, the CEO of FAS Andrey Kingivsky, believes that this should not be done, since the order must be carried out by a gene contractor.
Or it'll work out, like, in the famous Avenger Rykine, "There's a claim to the Pulse?"
Israeli children are returning to school after the Gaza Strip war
Thousands of Israeli children in territories close to the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday, after spending their summers in shelters, when missiles and mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the Territory recovered from the fighting.
The beginning of the school was a source of joy and excitement for the missile-affected southern Israeli settlements, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, Pashos, a kindergarten that was hit by a rocket, removed traces of wall fragments and children's mountains before the pupils arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronnit Bart, a resident of Kibutz Saad, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a decent life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she would start going back to school "a little weird."
"There was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Raven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the cease-fire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Sa'ad, did not go out or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape missile and mortar fire.
Many of the residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a piece of Palestinian mine, doubt the need to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border, which had been severely affected by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do our utmost to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas ' s demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of proximity negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel challenges these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazans fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the southern part of the country.
The Israeli army, in the meantime, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy now living in one of Gaza's schools.
According to a popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter increase in seven years.
The housing cost index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital grew by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice that of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed throughout the country.
RP Research Director Tim Loulis reported that Sydney and Melbourne are operating a two-level market.
The figures for RP Data show a 16.1 per cent increase in Sydney housing prices over the past year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbein and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost reductions were made, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loulis said that as the spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estates put on sale over the next few months, which would be a market test.
"In view of the current high speed of auction sales, the overall high sales speed and the current conditions with a low interest rate are likely to increase the cost of housing in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in Ufa's Oldest House
In the former house of gold miners and mining agents, Eudolim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Grand Casansky) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed much since construction, apart from fermentation.
Foreigners walk here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they are happy to have the privilege of living in the oldest Ufim home, whose walls are remembered by General Alexander Sovrov.
The date of construction of the house is not accurate, and historians indicate two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is 300 years away.
Old court, always open door, squeaking stairs.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls are trimmed, and the street is visible in the lights of a stray plaster.
I think everything holds true.
And the local people say, "You don't think it is."
Living in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, ” says Tatiana Lukiyanov, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on state guard, but it doesn't make money for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have forgotten about.
The last maintenance was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin, poor, but the foundation's gone.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street and pray once a week in a public bath.
How can we be content with such conditions?
The road passes directly under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pushes away the curtain.
Now you can see what you've only heard before, and there's a stream of cars running under the windows.
You see, the glass's always combing, the windows can't open, but the noise is used to it.
But man is accustomed to everything, to what is good and what is bad.
Our apartment is still a model, thank you husband, his hands are gold.
In particular, we have two rooms, three with our son.
And other families have conditions that are much worse, and on the second floor, the ceilings are just over a foot and a half high.
For Tatiana's contrast, she's offered to visit a neighbor at No. 6 of Ludmila Stara's apartment.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with our husband and our daughter and granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been any other apartment. Ludmila looks around the room: Antisols, two couches of "g," one of which has been placed on one of them by a grandson with a laptop.
Very close and very little is different from the usual domestic interior: only ceilings are beautiful, "historic."
But the ceiling is regularly leaking, and the plumbing system is not fit anywhere.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as a common and striking simultaneously as an Italian house on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, day-to-day and legendary:
The conductor spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a lockup and a toilet from the ex-heart.
We live right where Demido and his family lived, where servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, is it?
At the Real Estate Center, Ufas says privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle down, but the promised action did not proceed.
I'm not used to complaining, nor will I.
This apartment (room!) was full of dynasties — my grandparents, my mother and dad, my husband, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything's been there for a while.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flank, they're three feet thick!
It's said that the solution was mixed with eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is built solidly, thank you Demido!
I guess that's why I haven't killed anyone with a falling ceiling or my own.
The only thing that slows down in front of us is that the boards and the log houses rot, the fields fell apart, we poured cement on several occasions, but it's useless -- the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say there is, under our room, a hidden loop and a walk to the White River, which has specifically made some of the doorposts that once lived here so that you can hide from danger, in which case.
They were persecuted.
Sophia Starestina tells us how some historian came to see them, begged them to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then I convinced them to give them their apartments in exchange for their one on October's avenue.
Sophia's story says,
Where are we four at one time?
And there's a small hope here that they'll give you more space.
We're willing to trade, nothing's gonna win.
The Old Man's family didn't win anything.
Ludmila's greatest dream was to be settled, and her 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families were given a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
The cute, miniature girl, Olesa Karsakova from apartments Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two close rooms, a total area of 23 m2 called apartments.
We're just seven people, two kids.
You can see the conditions yourself.
There are pieces, like window frames, in the kitchen walls, and in rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
As you walk through the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, you can see that most of all were lucky to Lavrentiev's wives from No. 4.
They occupy the outermost rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
75 square places, three people are described.
We live right in those rooms where Suvrov is legendally stopped while he was in Ufa,” says Alexander Dmitrijevich Lavrentiev, head of the family.
The ceilings are high, simple.
One bad thing is that everything around us is cracking, falling, moving.
The neighbors must have told you!
The most painful thing we have with the floor is that the wooden boards rot, the ground literally gets out of the way.
I've set up a support, a clinic; there's nothing else in the room, and we're walking around in the other room, like we're rolling on swings, so fast.
The house of the merchant Eudolim Demidoda Alexander Dmitriewicz can tell better than any guide guide.
The gold industry is viewed as a native, and it is a delight.
Indeed, the identity was indistinguishable: the owner of the Kagin and Uzian factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held Arab mines.
The heirs of the purchase estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I lived here as a child in the '40s,' says Alexander Dmitriewicz.
Then there were wooden quarters for carriages, stables and barrels, which were subsequently destroyed.
In 1968 we wanted to clean up our house, but something interfered...
The story was repeated in 2014, and new housing was again lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, escaped the necessary facilities, and suddenly learned that the move was carried to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in all this...
Two years ago Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
Resident officials didn't accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a derision, they issued a paper without signature or press: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the settlement of the tenants."
I even have this feeling that our house is long gone in terms of the city, because first it was under number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's as if he's been knocked down in the 1970s.
The “Rusian Planet” has approached the lead sector for the land administration information and analysis of Ufa Vladimir Barabashu.
A house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 has been included in a programme for the settlement of large-scale housing.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only I know there was a plan to demolish all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of modern authorities to rebuild all old houses in the streets of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, has been successful.
Residents are soon planned to settle in new apartments.
According to Barabas, the House of Demidoda will be rehabilitated by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Italy is currently undergoing an architectural biennal, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016, all the old Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
The house will have a proper look that corresponds to what it used to be three centuries ago.
Demidova's house is likely to be a museum open to everyone.
In addition, it was decided at the government level to make the street on weekends a pedestrian.
Unfortunately, there's no way to get too busy in the city.
Russell’s future museum, Vladimir Barabash, promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to remain content with their new apartments being the same space as the current one.
Only from another age.
In Primorium, the storm started a forest fire.
The dry storm caused a forest fire on the grounds of the Hunting Land Forestry in the Fireland of the Primor Province.
A group of forces and assets are being expanded at the place of fire.
According to the management of the CGBU, the conditions created at the fire site require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Base:
A fire from a difficult area detected by an observer pilot on board an AN-2 patrol aircraft over an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood residues on the old burner.
The strong cloudy area and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of dropable firefighting sites pose a major challenge.
We need a MI-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces by MI-2 aircraft and AN-2 aircraft is very difficult.
Following the detection of the fire, four parachutist firemen were promptly planted.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-fighting equipment.
In the area of lunch, three additional fire fighters were delivered by helicopter to the village area.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of fire is ready, the specialists will be moved to the place of extinguishment, reported on the Primorsky Province Administration website.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsses a comedy, the Rudy's rare plates, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series on Radio 4.
Sodtrek is a mixture of horn and rap, and melodies are life's joys.
Henry, however, had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died, there was a "many" treatment, and Henry often thought about his father's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "No noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were grown-ups when I was a child, would go to the pub and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a blow in a scream.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a funny guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a Lithuanian workshop in Dadley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smoky, deep mazes with flashes of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My dad went into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to get away from the Lithuanian workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he'd been doing this for years and years to make a living for us, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left childhood with a lack of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frances, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I make friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Francesz, who married him for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started serious phyents classes, and I also had to get on a strict diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career path is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got a critical confession for his Otello, he's been totally in the theater.
Followed "The Comedy of Errors" and then "The fences" by August Wilson.
This work is different from the cetcoms and comedys, which were an integral part of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him climbing on stage, and he wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the middle of the seventieths: "For quite a long time, I was the only black paradoxist/ comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public but I had to learn to be an effective machine to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985 as a star working on television, which was very difficult.
Lenny in the New Persons in 1975
Because his manager was entitled to the Black and White minstrels Show, an easy entertainment program in which people turned their face, Henry discovered what he was doing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I think I want it never to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemned position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "a prized light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody on black people."
As he introduced the figures who were making fun of the British black culture, Henry was working on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Wo Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and he was known in the ninetieth season as, inter alia, Chief Guereth Blacklock from the comedy series "Shef!".
Advertising videos, documentary films, TV series, and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, LennyHenry.tv thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're dragging time or a little bit of a little bit of a pusher."
Next came a series of documentary programs on Radio 4, entitled "What's Good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy on Shakespeare.
You can't tell me that I've been taught so much in school, and I thought it was, to a great extent, the prerogative of middle class white people with collages and hoods down the front.
So I was really afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak up some of those words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines out of Otello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and it got stuck.
I feel like I can do this.
It's like my head's been corrected.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was rigid, and I read this play months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
We soon started "The Comedy of Errors."
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it through.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"The low voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're doing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the submission would resume once the problem had been resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else do this.
"You play a play, stay in play."
Henry's at "the fences" at Dachence Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for the fences.
The panic is quite useful, and it strengthens the muscles.
She was accepted well too, so it was like a sign above showing you, "What do you want to do?"
He's saying that, of course, with a big voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I love being in a tutoring room.
In fact, Henry's thinking of a comedian is still on -- all the way to our conversation is to break the heat of his humor when it starts, it's to parody.
I just decided not to work on the stand because this thing with the instantaneous remuneration of a complete stranger's room, I think, is dangerous.
If you're always going to do this, it could be a dead end.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Airline when I want to, but mostly, I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll give the stand tour ever more.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give up that.
So it's a new translation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payment statement.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid will be reported in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($70,000) per month was lost through payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited in bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri of the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required to appear within the next two weeks at identification centres to guarantee that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, as reported in a government statement.
Any person who fails to do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payment statement.
“This procedure contributes significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of government, thus putting an end to the problem of `invisible workers',” said Ann Waigur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government” by local media agencies.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers reported by Harriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in anti-corruption activities last December, which were designed to screen government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Reggie Taip Erdogan (at that time Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cliques Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine again opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been a major event for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsnia Jaczynuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told the expected journalists that not all schools had been opened again, but that he would do his utmost to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
All Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukov, the principal of the school in Slavyansk, where Jatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been marked by the wearing of sewn shirts, the holding of balloons, and the giving of flowers to their teachers.
In Ron's face, Fairhead BBC may have found the inspiring leader she needs.
It is followed by a glimmer of glory from the world of banking, media and internal affairs of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in decision-making positions.
Her career began with a consulting firm for the global management of Bain and Co, and continued with Morgan Staley, Bombadier, ICI and the world media in Pearsons.
She was the leader of the Financial Times for seven years when she resigned when Pearson's top man colleague took up a lower position.
It's said that her earnings are approaching 1 million.
Its political rating is also limited.
It was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he was trying to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is former adviser to Tori.
Previously on May, I called the Chairman of a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two focus areas: inside as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outward as the voice of public concern and unrest when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable dueo, which requires complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would risk coming, repulsing and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he were to lose his own work in this process.
That's a tough decision.
It would not be so difficult, and many people would be happy to see the BBC decrease in its size, after a review of its authority, finance and status.
As competitors narrow down and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of a licence pose a particular risk to BBC.
For a modest amount of ? 145.50 per year, the British are becoming a share of the world’s largest media enterprise.
BBC tells a good story: it claims that it covers 96 per cent of households and stands for only 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is increasing: 53 per cent of its support is now compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use models of BBC have changed: I now receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missing programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman -- I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside of it.
Twitter, from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas, Republic of Georgia, Rick Perry, on Sunday evening, contained an offensive image of the DPA, which is at the centre of criminal proceedings on charges of abuse of power.
Twitter was later removed, followed by another account from Perry, in which the record was dispossessed.
A tweet was just published from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it away," says a later record.
Perry’s assistants did not respond immediately to communications requesting comments.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually working on the tape.
The earlier tweets contained an indecent cartoon for the district prosecutor Travis Rosmary Lemberg, who found it guilty of intoxicating in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her office when she refused to resign, resulting in a large jury trial in Ostina this month against Perry, a potential presidential candidate in 2016 elections.
The text reads: “I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the level of blood alcohol allowed, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that.”
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
He was occupied by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a minister judge.
Perry did not confess guilt and called the charges a political trap.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who had served longer than anyone in the history of Texas, was vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and is responsible for the prosecution of corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto raised an official complaint from a public control group with left-wing views.
Perry's confirmed account is often updated and sometimes famous.
On arriving at the fifth party assembly in Iowa during its presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumours that he could get out of the game by publishing a tweet of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Burkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to “normal status”
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of intense demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fear that a credit bubble would lead Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of the Burkeley elite construction company, on Monday said: “The market has returned to normal levels of transactions since peak 2013 since the beginning of the current fiscal year”, adding that this has provided a “sustainable working environment”.
The London real estate market was successful during the recession as foreign buyers moved into the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent over the past year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly ignoring the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes of Burkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching ?423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “temperary tax” before the general elections in the next May.
The London Real Estate Agency, Foxtons, last week, warned that the April mortgage market reform, under which tighter loan terms were introduced, would also reduce the market growth of both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in approved mortgage loans in June, with further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Allis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Burkeley, raising sales to a value above ? 2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for good products and better locations has remained unchanged and, reflecting this, the sales have been maintained for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost one third more than the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
The annual return on taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to ‐380 million, and income by 18 per cent to ‐ 1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijli reported that the expected revenue of Burkeley for that year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to a unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected year-long before taxes are paid at $450 million.
The value of the Burkeley shares was maintained on ?23.96 in the afternoon on the London Exchange.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked published on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual award of the American Film Academy.
The photos of Jennifer Lawrence' naked actress, who received an Oscar prize, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a catalogue of pictures of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Star of the Cold Games confirmed that the pictures of Lawrence were real and condemned the hacker for “at once an invasion of privacy”.
The law enforcement agencies have been contacted and will persecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photographs originally posted on the photo exchange site of 4chan were allegedly obtained due to a lack of the Apple iClaude online storage system, and the intended "magnetic" of break victims includes the names of dozens of women of reputation, including Rianne, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzFed.
It is not clear how many of these photographs are true, although Scott Pilgrim's star against all' Winsted in Twitter has also been condemned as a break-in.
"Those who look at the photographs we took with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from Nikolodeon's "iCarly" series and "Victorial Victory" denied that she, in her photos, wrote in Twitter, "These are the so-called photos of the naked FALSVIKI, the people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzfed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop stars of Ariana Grande denied that the photos she was supposed to be on were true.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and the letter "J", commending critics
They're dissolved, the best way to say it is, they're gradually falling apart like a cardboard box that's left behind in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a little annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritated.
He was barbed like a vic, yeah.
The last victim of this thorny affair was a little affair from which he was waiting more than usual to be freed from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Aileen Solomons was a soberly fragile beauty with broken hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Reiben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevin considered to be her aunt, and she inherited a house in the raw but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Ray Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The trousers were running around, the spiders were sitting in the baths, and the mucus left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; and the garden was filled with weeds that looked like giant kettles.
It was like a cottage in a children's book, at the same time frightening and magical, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the 2014 Buckerow Prize Longlist.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevin and Aileen were sitting by their hands in broken sheets among the tall grass, enjoying a warm, warm spring day; they both opened their way to a cheap console, which provided the country with peaceful music and soothing news when he looked at her crossed brown feet and remembered the old song of a long forgotten black performer, whom his father loved to listen to and put the curtains in the house.
You've got too big your legs.
Because of their violent behavior, the songs of this kind on the console were no longer lost.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually forbidden - they were not lost.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word archaic.
The public taste was something that could never have been achieved by orders and orders, and just as people chose from books a rich man who had grown up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they had chosen ballads from all the music.
On this day, Kevin started playing on the imaginary piano and the rough comic voice of Eileen’s big legs.
Aileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz piano song called Fats Waller," he told her, machineically putting two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she flew off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father as he told him.
Start the word "J" by forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew it was coming from him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Aileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play, either, even though he wasn't openly banned.
The improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
I'll do the same.
His unpredictability worked on people's nerves.
Jazz was a piece of music.
Although he was 10 years old and had never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew about jazz from the Father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
Society was obedient, which meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude -- thanks to those who had been saved by fate -- for the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were well suited for entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.
Indostan’s descendants, as if by nature talented in all electronics, wanted no family to be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish Diaspora was done with sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was hit by a plate.
Those from the Persian Gulf and Leviticus, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when the same thing had happened, were afraid of being accused of inflammatory flames, in fear of being swallowed up by the next fire, of having opened restaurants and peasants, of not hanging out, and of being thrown away by idleness.
Each one according to his abilities.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Aileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words he had just sang to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kever.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden running gave him an illusion of security.
No word could enter through the soundproofing of giant leaves that look like capsoon leaves.
Aileen still didn't understand.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She did not trustfully put her head down, closing a look at Kevin.
In the whole world, there was nothing but a scrap of her blue hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if that's what you say," she said, staying at her disposal.
But it still doesn't explain why you're eating it.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have any big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Your ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you got fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I've got this perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked a soothing vow that could ease the cruelty covered in jesting.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted to.
Despite good eyes.
Aileen Solomons was painted and stood up from the carriage, retracted the console and shed the wine they drank.
Wine from the bush, so intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
You don't like it, though.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold Northern Archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt what she looked like.
The same huge ice ocean struck them both.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after the thing that we've been through, as long as their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers were gone into rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dares to refuse them or to hurt them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a blunt fist if she wasn't careful!
First, kiss -- kiss now is the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the resistance to the Blood Bald that gave the console -- first kiss it and then hit it.
An excess of clarification, according to Cover, because kissing in itself was already a hooliganism.
Aileen Solomons showed him that he had to leave.
He came up from a carriage like an old man.
She felt lead gravity herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go away, and from the top window she watched him leave, her companion, a man himself causing trouble.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and the men at all, even though some of them had raised their hand against her.
A man who turned away from her, with a bent back, shamed, beaten, and all the ability to fight left him-- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any of the cases until today when she saw it?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or around Esma Nussbaum, a brainy and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in the Offnau, an informal public sentiment control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline if it did not stop entirely, given the means and the resources allocated to its eradication.
"Many things have been done, and many things have been done," she wrote, "to ease the inherent aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow neighborhoods, where, despite crammed by churches over the cities, the gentle breathing of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
Some qualities, however, prove to be non-accelerated.
The higher the pin, it seems, the lower the passion it creates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overcome obstacles, and proclaims its dusting faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness retain its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there are also evidence that new and vicious feuds are being created in homes, in workplaces, on roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her scholar, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esma Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
There's no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "wicked" and "grabbery," others would be interpreted as an expression of natural life's love and energy.
To continue to be bored about the very thing that's been done is to deprive the country of the life it needs.
Esma Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz was talking.
Behind his head are rose letters such as flamingo, LED letters echoed the advice that Offnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to the ball, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk to your friend, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, a song better than a written word, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean," replied Esma Nussbaum quietly when she found out her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we haven't been cured as effectively as we've convinced ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we repeat the mistakes that initially led to the very thing that we've been through, that we've been through.
Only this time will we vent our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinitz connected the ends of his fingers in a pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "missing" the actions that our grandfather did or did not do.
You go too far, and when you talk about throwing their "flame" and "untrust" into "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that when we understand the past, that is, by defending the present, we are not talking about "us" or "them."
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of unrest -- that's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," dared to insert the Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it's been bad or good, what's done is done.
It was then.
We don't have to say anything anymore. We agree here.
And if you don't blame anyone, you don't have to excuse yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not to learn?
The past thing is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to this--
The Pyramide Luther Rabinitz collapsed.
"I'll review your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcycle rider who went to the sidewalk, described by passersby as "in a vicious rage."
There's coincidences.
The Lesotho Army states that no coup was planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied the preparation of a coup d ' état aimed at overthrowing the Government, stating that they had acted against the police suspected of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabanae left the country, claiming that the country's army surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in Maseru's capital.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attack on his life.
The army representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, stated that there was no coup, but that the army responded to the threat posed by “political fanatics” whom the police tried to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action with several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to establish chaos”, he informed the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjella, said that the actions of the army looked like a coup d ' état.
“Although no one has filed claims for power-taking by force, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces are known to have the main signs of a coup”, he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that there was peace in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metzing manages the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabanae stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in her joint Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government despite the allegations of the contrary.
The Chelsea Lieutenant Marco van Ginkel will spend the coming season on rent rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutch man will arrive in Italy at the next hour for a medical examination.
In the last season, he was only three times in a field in London’s club.
Recall that Milan had previously rented Liverpool from the attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest level in 13 months
The growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Business Performance Index (PMI) of the eurozone production sector on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and enterprises were affected by growing tension between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
Values came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets will wait for the bank to have a clear plan to deal with the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the risk of inflation deflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that the ECB leader Mario Draga might later this week give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although any growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the manufacturing sector of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the block, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of great concern, as is Italy ' s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the momentum for growth has been largely from the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, have not added confidence either,” said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of the industry is most likely to carry oil into the fire by analysts awaiting the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One good news was from Ireland, where PMI had grown to 57.3 at its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the Business Performance Index for the production sector of the eurozone is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone are apparently finding life very difficult at this time, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainties to many countries.
This increased tension has apparently struck business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "it's more like" that the ECB would eventually have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "though we suspect it's going to be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupoli will make a living chain against the militia.
In Mariupola until last week, everything was calm, and nobody broke up organizing the Mariopol People's Republic, a city on the Azov Sea, lived and worked.
Now the residents are fearfully expecting the poplars to come.
According to political scientists, separatists are breaking into Mariupoli to reach the Azov Sea, recently taking Novoakovsk, a city that had not previously been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariopolians decided that the Ukrainian army, even though protecting them, had a little force against the highly armed members of NAMA-LPR and were about to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building roadblocks and strengthenings.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city and entered a living chain, crucifying Ukraine’s gymn.
They're going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and pick up equipment and food, collect medicines, and publish the newspaper.
Shops are gradually closed in town, and banks and ATMs are no longer working.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible takeover of school, like children in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death in school atrocities.
Just ten years after the terrible takeover of a school in Beslan, during which 334 people died, including 186 children who had heroically survived the disaster, warned yesterday night of a new apocalypticism in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of a very extreme evil.
The tragedy has united the east and west into aversion, which has since been miraculously turned into a reality and a hope for the future in the face of the worst tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the scourge, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine, in which children like them are killed, will end now.
The girl in the photo is trying to get back to the shooting gym.
She was filmed in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Belakov, while trying to get back into a shooting gym after a mine explosion.
I was desperate for my mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run hard, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and came back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After some operations, she thought she was completely restored, but last night she said, "The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more operations.
A few fragments remain in my lap.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly has not broken it," she says with a call.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gymnasium to remember all those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too intense.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says that her capture stays with her, even though her memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the assistance we received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I'm in the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through hail bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians begin school at 7 years of age) and have survived three days of capture, hugging their mother Tamaru.
Then he was seven, and he said, "My mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Guy."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran off and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed hold of his hand, and ran through hail bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who took his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I have not been able to save her."
In fact, Tamara went to freedom and was in a hospital with leg wounds, thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children from the Barnardo's Foundation, Prime Tony Blair, and his wife, Sherie.
"This is a nightmare coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that he's missing out on my memory.
I remember when I threw away all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard I never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to pick out whatever I wanted, and the car was open to the top.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the grief he and his friends have experienced.
This horror is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir last week who was volunteering at a women's monastery.
I really want to help.
I want to serve the police at any time, and I hope that I will be admitted to the school next year.
His mother, Tamara, aged 48, said, "37 kids were killed in our block, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the capture, but there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damier to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, and they can provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for that award and for the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years has gone by, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the borough, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitresses at the restaurant, Dymir was shooting at them from his water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world is any better than this 10 years ago.
There is now war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people war is a news report they're listening to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Dair grew up and became a very soft and calm boy; he is not aggressive or evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck on this last nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch, leaving us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he dropped all his weapons and other military toys.
It's hard for me to believe that for hours I was so sure he died and that I'd never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me as parts of the body lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again, I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
Thus, life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after capture became the determining factor for the Beslan tragedy
Peace: Survivor of Beslan George Ilyin with his mother Fatima after his capture in 2004 and George's right today
His bloodthirsty face was a print of fear when he was saved from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, aged 54, was taken to school on the first day of her studies before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not exactly one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Greeting into the shower: The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of George's weeping in San Marino.
George doesn't like this picture, and it's hidden in our book closet at home.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
They are now investigating this Boing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war because it's happening?
Ten years is nothing for such a pain.
We need to take decades to forget her for a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years old, I had nightmares because of my capture, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym in front of every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladikakaz.
I'll learn to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health wasn't allowed.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: Georg Farniev was at the feet of a killer terrorist at the time of his capture, but he managed to survive.
At the time of the capture, he was photographed in a gym next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study with an intelligence officer at the FSB, but was unable to do so because of the damage he suffered during his capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and it's said that kids are easy to deal with bad things, and I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, next year, I was the first and last time I entered this gym.
I'm unconscious.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm well.
I need to be careful with my knee, which has been damaged, but now I'm on my way.
But health didn't allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was impossible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns how to treat all cats and cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and of course it's not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, age 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
She should be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgie's grown up now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's got several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he'd overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome it and forget it.
That terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and it only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son's with me, and that's the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We've been one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them out as far as you can.
Alona Tskaeva, 10 years old
The young man who was touched to take to a safe place on the side of the S.O.S.
Saved: Alenu Tskaev is taken to a safe place by the Russian side of the Special Forces (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman was taken from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's ten-year-old sister and Brother Mahara in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alenina’s mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and they and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter whom he called Christiana in memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alina, who is now ten years old, remembers nothing about the capture and blossoms into a smart and happy girl, the neighbors say.
"They're a happy family now, and Alina and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a dear friend.
He is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
The paralegal of Sinji Kagawa, who had returned from the Manchester United to the Dortmund "Brussion," noted that he was looking forward to getting out into the field again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play "Brussion" again, and it's Bild's words to Kagawa.
I feel very good.
I look forward to getting back into the field in the form of "Brussion."
Remember, Kagawa moved to MU from Borassia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to fit into the English club, spending only 38 matches in two seasons in the English championship, killing 6 balls, and giving up 8 successful programs.
A man is charged with visiting a girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought to trial on charges of three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa.
Gordon Stuart allegedly hit a girl on a transfer to Pittenwin in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart was leading his Audi Q3 without due care and a girl was beaten and injured.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Antrander, denied his guilt before the Dandey Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Oldland will not depart in Vladivostok
A duty-free shop shop at the Duty Free Airport of Vladivostok put out a plate prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in this store.
Don't give them spirits, vodka and horses.
The store administration decided that President Barak Obama of the United States, chancellor of FDG Angel Merkel, President François Alland of France, Vitaly Kličko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other prominent associates would not be able to get any vodka, horse and perfume from their shop.
And I put a tablet on the door.
Obama had previously received a ban on the emergence of an institution that was even less accessible to him by type of service, the Diet Table CIM, as reported by the site of general hospitals.
Whether the U.S. president ever wanted to eat in a diet table in Russia is not known, but the baners seem to be terribly mad.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the Agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that under the embargo new technologies should be developed by Russian Agrarians in order to produce the raw materials demanded from buyers.
The board was given during a visit to South Piceprom by Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also gave advice to the Rectors to shift to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The chief trainer of the Russian Federation, Valentine Maslakov, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
The third place, according to the expert, is a good result given the lack of targeted training for competitions.
Our athletes have spoken at their level, and they bring Maslacov's "The Sing of Sport."
The third place is to confirm our high enough command level.
It's a pleasure that the French and even Americans have a minimum advantage over us.
We must bear in mind that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The zone is over, and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been the second to this tournament, but during this season we've been updated.
On the contrary, the French have launched a combat team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been publicly announced on many occasions.
Even so, the contestors could not resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order lower than the same Brillian League.
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important as team competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, I agree, it's absurd that by 1,500 metres men were so involved in tactical maneuvers of the race that they showed the result below the average... of women's races.
4 hints to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or make a video under the water, there are a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight mill, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a few cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, several rules must be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the camera batteries and other compartments are closed tight.
Also, set up your camera for the kind of photos or videos you're going to make.
Some cameras and cameras have surveying regimes or an object type that optimize the exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your machinery can go down.
Some cells are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take some of your staff off because a lot of them won't get there.
There's a JCK that can help you build pictures, whereas there's usually no action cameras.
Even if you have a LCD, it'll be hard to see under the water, and it's going to be a random process.
That's why don't you do a couple of jobs.
Also, if your camera has a serial film mode that takes a few people with a little different exposure, use it.
Stay outside.
The number of lights decreases significantly than the depths you dive under the water.
If possible, stay outside the surface when you are filming in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass on more colors in your photographs; the deeper you go, the less you will see.
Come closer to the film facilities.
It's a great advice for land surveying, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you are filming an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-range lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the camera if you want to fill in the frame.
The 2012 Olympics Bronze on the Free Fight of Bilal Mahh may enter the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Sajid Sajidov, chief coach of Dagestan's free struggle.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the Tashkent Peace Championship in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahh is at the assembly of the class team, with the words “P-Sport” of Sajid Sajdova.
In fact, Bilál's youth was also involved in both styles.
At the first youth of the world, in 2005, he won the Volknikov tournament and the third prize in Greek Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since we talked that a new phase of our career is going to have our weight in the Grecian and Roman struggle.
I'm going to say more, Machov may be in the world championship in Tashkent, if he wins.
But the key word is always at the coach's headquarters, headed by Gogi Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality might have stirred up everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
Counseling anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to ridding the sick of both the suffering and the torment of treatment.
Among those who appealed to him, his wife recalled that an MI-6 officer had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that as long as the doctor was engrossed in diagnosis and disease, those who undergo treatment were mostly concerned about something completely different -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was found to be someone who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
I found it hard to find strength.
In his fight with flu - like symptoms, he found that he was angry with his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he remarked.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to X-ray the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he was riding skis in the French Alps.
X-ray results are here.
It was a mesothelooma, an incurable cancer that affected the pleura, or the shell of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to understand the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all those suffering from lung cancer have smoked.
But it's different with mesothelia.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be overlooked.
Asbest is, after all, a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when used, only people from specific industries worked closely with him: pipe-ins, builders, carpenters and doc workers, for example.
Industrial toxins from another age, he hardly sees any cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the mesothelooma epidemic.
There's more people dying of mesothelooma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of approximately 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from road accidents.
Annual number of Mesothelooma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, although asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelooma usually takes decades to develop.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to industrial construction veterans.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, placed in homes where we live, offices where we work, schools where we study, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesothelooma does not pay attention to the class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The elective bastions, from the fashionable London department to private schools, have proved to be no salvation.
The House of Parliament is sprouted by asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tubeproofer.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he did.
"It is said that there might have been a lot of asbestos in tunnels in Guya Hospital, where I spent six years in internships," he wrote.
All -- students, nurses, doctors and trucks -- used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers get the same disease?
It was a question that unfortunately could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who had been trained in Guya Hospital and who had subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years”, he noted in a letter in 2010, “I'm the only survivor.”
How many of us are suffering from this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's so unusual to live this long.
Fifty per cent of those with mesothelioma die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are going to get this same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the leading expert on Mesothelomy in Britain, it is likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't know what they're going to die like this right now.

The rapid review of court reports, where victims often seek redress, shows how far the mesothelioma has become inundated.
In June, for example, Marks & Spriser admitted that he had been overlooked by Janice Ellen with asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before that happened," she said, "I never heard of mesothelomy, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't have thought I'd be affected.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They were named “asbestiform”, which means a fiber structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in blood panels, on-site tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boilers, even the brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as “a serious cause of health damage”, which could lead to death.
The risk is greater, however, for brown asbestos (amposite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are substantial, though indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main cause of an extremely high number of patients with mesothelooma [in Britain]”.
Marks & Spacer was exposed to asbestos at the company’s main store at Oxford Street, London Alami
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
It conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “the real percentage of mesothelis, when there is no known impact on work or home, is likely to be caused by asbestos exposure from the environment”.
Most of these impacts, he says, are due to “usual use and weather effects” on our buildings.
No one seems sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the heart of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committee premises were contaminated by asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be moved by something as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems correct.
Although the Parliamentary Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitation certificate”, it now recognized the need to work on ?1 billion for the reconstruction of Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might meet in the QE2 conference centre near the vicinity of the Parliament rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
Goddard reported that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to the various rules”.
It is impossible to know if this management error is worth living.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, age 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he was working in hospitals.
"I was working in a hospital that was successfully brought up with asbestos-related claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
That he remembers clearly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I started to get sick.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from a pleura, a shell around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Concerned doctors took X-rays of the chest and set up plevral cartridges to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for tests.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
His state of health gradually improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of the Abbott's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with a mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
Eventually, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was clear in that case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his consulting doctor showed his CTC results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into a hole between his chest shell and his light shell.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, frankly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was a week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott went into a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common," he said.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
Thus, the mesothelooma now impresses younger people of unusual occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insured pipes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients will suffer.
But many of the staff who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement tables (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, hospitals were found to be a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
He's still being deleted today.
Students were putting their Bunsen burners on asbestos swings
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbeste was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of her amazing isolation and fire resistance.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in class for the first time.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren placed their burners on asbestos substitutes.
Websites have been launched to highlight asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as slab or locust roofs, were usually used to contain asbestos.
"It's industrial poison, stored in a huge amount of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against the Guya Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful about sleeping with garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when you know that the disease is incurable, ogroman.
"It takes quite a long time to realize it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and sort myself out.
Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was to move from a doctor to a patient's position.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he needed to receive.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it's the mechanics of how we sustain life -- the act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most of the mesothelooma cases are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbeste consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can be stuck in a ple History, a lung shell.
Asbesto fibers are irritable and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of asbestos's needle fibers," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading Mesothelooma treatment centre.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably exposed while in the hospital.
When the asbestos needles fall into the lungs, says Treger, "the breath pushes them to the field where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the outset.
The normal treatment of other forms of cancer is much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes heated arguments.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger disagrees.
"You can't cut out a pleura," he says.
It's impossible to get a knife around her.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very good at chemotherapy" that "acts" but doesn't cure.
"There are sometimes long-lived patients," says Treger.
But ultimately, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live far, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after a diagnosis was made.
Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
Following his mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis had been presented, had become a support and counselling office for the same patients alone.
"Allo, Rakova Central," he was happy to say when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott proposed six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson did, however, "swept to give everything a little more positive color."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Laszorunski, Professor of Toracical surgery at the Guya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for those with mesothelioma in order to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally imminently ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could be at risk.
It was at that time that the company’s integrity was spoken of.
Andrew Lawson and Guy Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full-cost settlement, according to Morgana, because Lawson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelooma was the result of contact with asbestos in the Guya Hospital.
Following an investigation into his death, the representative of the Guy Hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements referred to had been removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, tying death with asbestos to one company or place of work, usually decades later, has proved to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma that require compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed down.
Insurance archives could be lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that on their side there is no time for the plaintiffs.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been enacted to facilitate recovery of compensation for patients with mesothelioma, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under this Act, a $350 million fund financed by the insurance industry was established for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who are not to be tried.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about 120,000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that ?350 million are “very good work” for the insurance industry.
“It's a deal written by insurers for insurers”, he says, assuming that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay had they not intervened in temporary intervals and patients with mesothelioma could track down companies and file a claim in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “unfulfilled”.
However, both Pening and Morgan admit that with seven people dying every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," said Pening during his second reading of the Bill of Mesothelomy last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lange-Laszorunski for 19 months.
Following initial consultations, Lange-Laszorunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he believes is effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lanj Lasznounski could boast 40 per cent of survivors over five years.
Abbott felt strong.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it from patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show a trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were several fifths in my chest.
I was just supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy again.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, the process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things -- financials, when I die, for example, or what I need to show my wife how a timer works on a boyfriend.
When you get bad news, you get discouraged.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, age 16, and Tamzin, age 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They responded very differently.
The Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us were calling very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancers have to face.
But for those with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by permeability.
The disease carries with it (even as Stephen Jay Gould eventually carries with it) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.

During World War II, court construction, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of contact with asbestos, is developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage resulting from contact with asbestos in Great Britain.
The global production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Great Britain requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All asbestos use is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelitic Act was adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme in the amount of ‐350 million has been announced.
Asbeste is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protestors swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
This is likely to mark the beginning of long-awaited protests in Hong Kong ' s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress of China essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but it does make us angry," said legislator Emily Law, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
China's protective decision, Lee Fey, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, said that it would be too “haotic” to allow for a popular election of the head of Hong Kong.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the region to elect a head of Government by voting since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward because it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates strictly controlled from Beijing.
Under the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was taken after summer when one of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong had occurred over the years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central from Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to close down Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee a genuine universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central's supporters met in the rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the weeks ahead.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of capture of the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could only be taken if all the possibilities of the dialogue had been exhausted and there was no other option.
We greatly regret to report that, to date, all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central area will no doubt take place.
The Government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures involving police and barricade had been strengthened on Sunday at Government headquarters.
In Hong Kong many feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland have increased competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong ' s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressures from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations place business at risk, the source of Hong Kong's life force.
"The test they are talking about, it can result in great economic damage, depending on how much person will be involved and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
It's an idea that's harmful to investment.
China ' s public media also reported in recent days in which the Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists were shown to be dissidents sent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted over one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture comes to university life: first-year students were offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are happy to respond to this demand by launching the first Lux travel service in the United Kingdom for current students.
To leave a clear impression of coming to university, the company also offers options for transportation such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Pantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said the service thought about security.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new versions for VIF, we look forward to helping students this year reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The company representative reported that since the service had just been launched, no orders had been received yet, but added that “students would start ordering this service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, although students had to pay for their studies ?9,000 per year, they hoped to find a market for that service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10 or 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes to do that.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being torn away from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NPO for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly remote from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start university studies this month face a cost-of-living crisis where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly rising costs of basic needs before they can at all start thinking about putting thousands of pounds out on something like simply arriving in a dorm room.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
A unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who came raise their hands and say, "Rocks up, don't shoot," while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, involving the murder of Michael Brown's unarmed teenager, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Perez saw responses from white women who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
In comparison with the reaction of black women shortly after the 9 August murder, personal essays with titles such as “Ferguson's thoughts on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about the oppression of women” were relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we faced, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so racially related, they felt that they needed to be pointed out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio, Corita Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems black American women face every day but are not perceived as “women's issues” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'm going to get 150 swearers all over the place," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share these problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the Feminist Master's Office, Angela Hetter, Professor of Women's and Gender Studies at the University of George Mason, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynching, almost always for rape of a white woman," he said.
A white woman needed to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hetter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white Sufressists, for example, Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all eggs in a basket of women's voting rights, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," he said.
A look back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and their sons.
Even after women had won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynchings.
The group appeared nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In Mitchell's view, the rise in the response of white feminists to the problems raised by Ferguson's situation - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “solve” the problems that black women had faced in several generations.
"Indeed, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feministic] ideology took seriously the right to raise a child, how do they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The Second Wave Feminists, who have made a career in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what it means.
Gloria Stanem, a prominent white activist two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published an extensive article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans participate more in protests about racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body -- and the views on racial issues that are significantly different in public surveys -- will be at the head of change," wrote Stynam.
Although Stynem is responsible for more cross-cutting feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, its comments on the race in America still surprise some.
Researcher Christine Summers of the American Business Institute, author of Who Stealed Feminism, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, were “more vulnerable than their sisters”, but Steinme's rabbles about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother's Watch, to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking boys, many feminists, including Gloria Stainem, reacted angrily.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that drives the forward line of traditional feminism.
After some 63,000 minors were arrested by the U.S. border service without escort on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform has again reached the surface -- this time the issue of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-Chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important to women, she had only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's pig house is sold.
A picture of a house set up for sale in Saffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was shown to be a large pig resting in a living room.
A separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipsvic.
The detailed description was a picture of the living room - on which a pig with a head resting on the couch was depicted.
The Real Estate Agency Connels reported that the pig in the photograph was the homeowner's favorite.
“However, the photograph has been placed by mistake and has already been removed”, reported a representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described a former meeting house as “a unique separate house with one bedroom”.
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it was still maintained in advertising materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapov, in a U.S. 4-C. Open match, the retreating Carolyn Woznitzki believes that she lacks stability.
According to the sportswoman, she wants to finish the year and try to get to a new level, handing over Vasily IPOQ from New York.
How do you generally measure your results at the Big helmet tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Rollan Garros.
As for the other three, I was not stable, especially in the aftermath of some matches.
I'm upset now, of course.
I couldn't even get to the fourth.
What tasks do you set for yourself before the end of the season?
After the injury, I have a lot of motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tour series begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, Former Peace Champion Nicolai Valuev proposed that the GTO should be used as a bonus for admission to college.
He said that in general, standards would be the same as in Soviet times, and people would be able to set standards by stretch, run and other exercises.
Remember, 12 Russian entities will be implementing TTO standards on their territory as of 1 September.
I also invited school students who had given up TEO to give bonuses when they went to college, ” Valuev noted.
For example, you could add some points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional exit workers of enterprises who have been subjected to these sporting tests.
In the city of Harvey, South Wales, there was a new millionaire after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
There is a search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the playing lottery on Saturday night.
Harvey’s newspaper stand brings gold to the fore for the second time in five years, and last win is $1 million in November 2009.
A successful winner, however, still needs to claim to himself.
Steve Forvard, the owner of the bench, said that the winner had won a handicraft in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and it's very excited.
We thought such a win might be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated the top prize last month, noting the end of several good weeks for state players.
Last week, a Canning Way player became one of the five millionaires of August, followed by a huge $7.5 million winning couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and had reported that winning had given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A Harvey millionaire brings the number of winning prizes in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total benefit of $85 million.
Mini-economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Ministry of Education will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally sound transport in Russia to the Government, and will present the Director of the Department of Oleg Plunikovs at a round table on the Moscow Autosalon 2014.
The plan is directed by the Government and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September and early October, and the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - the plan for the development of gas-fuel vehicles in Russia is already in place.
The plan (a copy with the Knowledge) is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electrical transport will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending and concessionary lising will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
Regulations are to be amended in 2014-2015 to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking spaces, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to the regional authorities during 2015 that they also encourage the use of environmentally sound transport, in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, proposals to increase public purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Minoconomation would list regional government performance indicators that reflected the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia is still only forming - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty for electric vehicles was over, so sales would be about 500, predicting the chief executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But five-fold growth does not make electric vehicles any visible: 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in 2013 in Russia, according to the Association of European Business.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors have imported electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault, a company focused primarily on corporate clients, said the Director of Strategic Planning and Renal Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
The majority of other electric transport manufacturers, however, took a wait-and-seek position for Russia.
There's also Russian producers working on electric cars -- ", GAZA," but output is marginal.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AVVAS released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low owing to the cost of electric vehicles, acknowledges the Director of Autovas for the Engineering of Sergei Amanov, without the master of a breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the cost of cars (e.g. electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average twice the cost of analogies with internal combustion engines) has held back the insufficiency of the charged infrastructure (coupling units), a sigh of the director of the Avtostata, Sergey Tchiskov.
Because of the expensive and low cost of electric vehicles in the next three to four years, it will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicting Michael Traveller's editor-in-chief, Mikhail Trek agrees with him.
On the other hand, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian market has good prospects, and above all, to inspire consumer confidence that “electronic” is real; this will, in particular, be facilitated by the emergence of new charges, and stresses the President of Group BMW in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being carried out, for example, by the State of the Russian Federation: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are under way with other regions on the construction of a filling chain.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of the Department of Rossets, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, as a network company, the Internet is not entitled to sell electricity, and an opportunity is being explored to do so with regard to the charge of electric vehicles.
Pankov considers that the most effective measure of mastering the construction of the Russian market for electric cars is the enrichment of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, expanding the grace list is being explored.
The replacement of a transport tax on the environment (an idea discussed and applied to all cars) would also support the market, but not as tangible as Customs preferences, in Pankov ' s view.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, as opposed to Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles, which now accounts for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed into Colorado
A single-motored Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three out of five people in it were killed and handed over to ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident took place several kilometres from the airstrip of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In Donetsk region, prisoners of the Donbas battalion are dealt with.
The Karaites were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of them died under fire.
Survivors say that if they knew what the situation in south-eastern Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be described as lucky.
The soldiers of the Donbass battalion remained alive after the meat cut into which they came under Ilowaysk.
In the vicinity of the army, Donetsk People ' s Republic of Korea has spent several days, virtually abandoned by its commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that the ring could be removed from the alleged corridor, the column moved.
But in just a few minutes, the projectiles and bullets are hanging on all sides.
"The judge for the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed out," says the Deputy Battalion Commander with the call of Leermont.
And when we came down between Polypoly and Redszewski, we started a cross-fire with anti-tank controlled missiles, with skates, with grenades of 30-mm, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead and three cars behind me, and there were only two cars left.
The officer with the Laermont call says that at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, and many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those whom they have come to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised to see so-called "terrorists" treating them well, giving them food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
Colonna, the whole battalion to be destroyed.
At the Donbass Battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexey volunteered because Ukrainian news reports described the atrocities allegedly committed by separatists in the south-east.
Alexey saw a different picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me there was a mortar fire, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, and said one of the soldiers, Alexey.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander. I've already written a report on my departure.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from our charges with Zurahkovo.
According to prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cotle" of Ilowaysk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would not enter the battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the MNR militia.
Everyone is checked for involvement in war crimes.
Food price control headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyar province, which will, if necessary, limit the increase in the price of products in the region.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the Government of the Province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the province.
Vesty Economy - Will Kiev pay $140 million in damages?
Igor Sechin, Head of the Rosneffti, stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the attack of the Lisican NPP in Ukraine in $140 million.
That's what he said in Spiegel's interview.
“We estimate damage of $140 million and will negotiate compensation with the Ukrainian Government”, Sekina said.
According to him, the modernized Lisician NPP was planned to enter into operation in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no 'unsoiled rebels', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil lost in the pipes," he said.
We will recall that on 18 July, in connection with the attack on the Lisician NPP, a oil storage tank was burned and two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisician NPP, the main refinery in Ukraine, was introduced first in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisician NPP is about 7 million tons per year.
The plant is able to produce the fuel standard Euro-4 as well as the diesel batch Euro-5.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisician NPP were suspended due to its loss.
At the plant, repairs were scheduled to begin.
A year later, Rosnefft received the Lisican NPP along with other Ukrainian assets from TNC-XB.
The DPRK launched a small-range projectile towards the Japan Sea.
The South Korean media report that this took place around 10:30 a.m. in the local time of the province of Chagando, which is located on the border of North Korea and China.
As reported by Interfax in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, it is alleged that the rocket fell into the Japanese Sea after it flew some 220 kilometres.
Rubl falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew by 3 cop to 37.15 roubles, the ruble fell into a billing basket against the background of geopolitical tension.
The dollar ETC trades started transactions at lines 37.11 to 37.2 roubles./$1, an average rate of 37.16 roubles per two minutes./$1, that's four copies above the level of the previous closure.

The United States dollar is traded 23 copies above the official rate, and the euro is worth 16 copies above the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but this time there was no panic.
Continued cheap and rouble, and even updated the historic maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now playing out in advance of the deteriorating geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But for the time being, it's more like an artificial hysteria spread through the media, especially Western ones.
The options for imposing new sanctions on the Russian Federation are not so many.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we soon see a new negative, Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
Oreburg Airlines will be tried with Ideal Tour.
Oreburg Airlines filed claims for the “ideal-tour” totalling 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will take place in October.
There will be different judges to deal with cases.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's just over 425 million roubles.
The meeting was scheduled to be held on 7 October.
A second application was filed on 18 August.
It's worth 4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting was scheduled to be held on 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union of Industry, judges in cases have been appointed different.
In July, information was received in the media about the debt of Ideal Tour to the Orenburg Avilles in the amount of 1.5 billion roubles.
Victor Zukin, Air Director, is talking about 1.6 billion roubles.
Vitaly Savelev's director of Aeroplota calls an even greater sum of two billion roubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter microblogging has changed the user registration process to involve new participants more quickly in an active relationship with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have left their microblogies.
Now new Twitter users will be browsing at the time of registration a large number of service-recommended accounts to complete their reading cycle immediately.
The recommendations are formulated on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
Twitter will automatically check for all automatically selected accounts.
This will make it necessary for the user to take his own mark off so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
While previously only the recommended users of the microblogging service have seen only the avatars, Twitter now prints a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help impress the person.
This is the largest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Twitter's been working actively lately on upgrading the service.
This activity is primarily linked to ongoing attempts by the service to achieve hopelessness.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in the activity of readers.
At present, companies desperately need more loyal consumer resources, which would last for a long time.
Only in this way can there be a steady flow of advertising tools.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be luxuriant and heavy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day, reports meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, and in Posmoskovje from 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather is cloudy, it's going to rain, and the wind in the eastern quarter is going to be quite weak -- only 3-8 meters per second.
Car recycling programme resumed on 1 September
The car recycling programme has been in operation since 1 September in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
The Head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Mantourov, explained that money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
A similar car recycling programme had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference between the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now not only intended to dispose of vehicles for subsequent discount, but also to be possible if the car has reached the age of more than six years to acquire a new discount when the old one is transferred to a dealer's "trade-in" transfer, it is transmitted to Interfax.
The previous federal recycling programme, which took place from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011, had cost over 16 billion roubles.
As a result, car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (that is plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
Coming Out Symulator's creator will release a game of contemporary journalism
Heimdizer Nicky Case, known as Coming Out Symulator, decided to release a game of contemporary journalism.
He told me about his project in KillScreen's interview.
Case started a few weeks ago on the game, but this fact has become widely known only now.
A source of inspiration for the game was Ferguson’s protests, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how information coverage of stories affects its implications.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the public.
The hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he takes the stage so that the police will look like heroes and the protestors are bandits, the police will be better able to treat him and send him to places where the ordinary person cannot pass.
If he highlights events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be taken by Twitter of the hero, where new subscribers will appear if the photographs presented there prove to be popular.
The game does not yet have a name.
The date of exit and the platforms on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photograph is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill View Case, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but originally wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip rather than to protests in the United States.
After he started collecting the game material, he realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media coverage of Ferguson’s events, he decided to play on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
The most famous of his projects was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which deals with Case’s own biography, deals with how bisexual teenagers try to tell homophobic parents about their relationship.
Helettey pulls Ukraine back into the bloodbath.
The appeal to prepare for the next “ten thousand” victims by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Géletei, draws the people to continue with the bloody confrontation, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to statements by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Heletei, who stated that `the end of the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists' and the beginning of the `Great National War', which would be calculated as `tens of thousands'.
The extent to which the head of the Ukrainian military department, who published the post on his Facebook page, is adequate, is not in the military field,” says a communication from Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian Defence Minister wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened several times through informal channels that if they continue to resist, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
However, he stated that the “operation on the liberation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate star images and apologized.
Today, terror has swept over 60 Hollywood stars.
The hackers hackers hacked primitive passwords into iClaude in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the blogger Perez Hilton.
It's true, not for long.
Remember, Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the Cold Games star, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all the images “sit” in the Network are genuine.
Over from Hilton, the creator of a single-name tabloid site, apologized to the actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues at the shop for publishing their open pictures, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do it.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm going to get away from Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice', blogger on Twitter.
However, all the open photographs of the stars have already spread through the network.
David Beckham was in an accident, hiding from his paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident, sleeping from a paparazzi.
This happened in L.A. at the turn of Bulvara Sunset.
A British football player broke up with the contusion and tension of the right hand muscles.
Beckham came out of his dad's salon, where he was waited for by his paparazzi.
Running away from their pursuit on a motorcycle, he didn't manage a turn with his control and fell, writes TMZ with reference to nearby football sources.
As a result, Bekham was hit, the muscles stretched to the right hand and scratches.
Tony Stuart suffers from an accident on his way back to the track
Tony Stuart's return to the track has ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Spedway race.
Stuart fell into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre broke down into 172 circles, putting an end to his performance.
Stuart took his sweaty car to the garage and then went out without talking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that 14 team members were upset but would now focus on the next weekend race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better.
Stuart first fell into the wall earlier on Sunday night following a clash with Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope of coming to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "Just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on a truck, and the crew were ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cups after his car hit and killed another driver during the ground race in northern New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to participate in the persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who was on the road to complain to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was taken as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three - time champion was met with loud cries and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from position 12, Stuart went to position four at the beginning of the race.
Then 122 circles after Bush's restaurant number.
A car 18 went off the track on the way out of rotation 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushed both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he got back to position 21.
Sorczak and Witorgan have cigarettes with Zvancek in Odessa
Xenia Sobčak and Maxim Witorg are now in Odessa, which the television conductor has not failed to report on his Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprised and greatly confused by the worshipers of a couple.
The picture's taken from Zvaneksky.
"At breakfast, Mikhail Mikhalić Zwanek Maxim explains what an instagram:) #Odessa" signed a photo of Xenia Sobczak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no bunny, no butter, no...
The couple decided that Ksusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?, "Corry kills!", "Coop-to-smoker breakfast) ", "If only cigarettes were on the table)") ", "Cension, do you smoke too?" were excited about your favorite subscriber of her blog.
Recall that recently Sobczak boasted of the delicious dinner he had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the table, and your husband has prepared dinner for you, for the first time for your marriage, which is delicious. The chief thing is that he should not say at the end of the meal, "that it should be every day," was boasted by his husband, Xenia Sobczak.
The picture shows that Maxim is busy preparing something, and there's salt and baked chicken on the table.
The Bulgarian prison officials carried out a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria have conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return to the former working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Salary increases are also included in the list of claims to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Christ Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, calling for the return of the previous 24-hour shift.
Although the Prison Workers ' Union has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement has been reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, and the head of the Directorate General for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Zhelvnai, has reported to the BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join in protesting the Prison Workers ' Union.
The Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed the Minister of Defence of the Government of Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Och, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers, with more than a third of the positions held by the Generals or Generals retired.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Och was formally approved as Prime Minister following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Transitional Military Government to the post.
A 60-year-old military officer who took over power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Minister's post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed parliamentarians.
According to Prautua Chan-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglac Chinawat.
The official Praut Chang-Och will be a temporary Prime Minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military took power on 22 May
against a complete paralytic of civil power.
Major political party leaders were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the arrival of the military, they were temporarily arrested by the leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Jinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis was rooted in 2006, when the army moved Brother Jinglik Chinawat Taxin from his post as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has led to their success in the elections.
However, many middle-class and capital elites have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
Nobody's ever told me that there's a better midway in the salad, I didn't promise you that, I'm getting rid of a waitress from the new Palm pastry.
It has to be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain inexorable.
Because everyone knows a long time ago, we say Belgium -- we mean the midnies, we say the midnies -- we mean Belgium.
Retortors like to say that success depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There's places that aren't good, but they're really good, but they're kind of awkward.
In short, when I sat down at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a coffee shop called "The City" (in honor of the same television program), then "Odesa Mom," and then a restaurant called "Bogole" and "The Friends of Beer."
Now it's beer again, but it's nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg — the barbed tablet and a pair of tables — had all the rest of the space left out of the sun.
But it's fun, like in a child's room -- red, yellow and green walls, multicolored chairs, instead of windows -- televisions where girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg are not new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of spilling beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
A corporate positive waitress presents the menu with fun, saying that "males are big seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of the Palm.
Menus are expected for content, but often very unexpectedly.
To whom, for example, it is assumed that a meat roll with Walloon nuns (280 rubles) is actually carpachcho, cut so thinly that parchment paper will appear in comparison with it to matter indeterminately thick.
You can only taste something if you warm up together.
The salads are even worse.
The classic Leszian (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of a balk iceberg, once torn away by some long-standing potato, scattered Kenyan fassel, bacon bursel chips plus some kind of marininated bow.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a ski salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not very positive either.
If it was still possible to close the eyes of the unpredictable quarters of the tomatoes or the overheated shampyons, why would the mideas look as if they had been able to freeze and cook several times in their lifetime!
I already know that there are perfectly normal blomorrhages here!
They're served in "in sauces for your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The half dozen sauces, the white wine, the selery and the carrots, didn't come out frankly.
There's food, there's no aroma, there's no wine, there's no mystery.
But the good people who rely on the almonds with the household mayonnaise.
A chicken vaterism here is not a groovy, dense to such an extent that you can decide, depending on your mood, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice plumbing soup.
It was said that the rabbit's local cook was prepared in beer sauce, and nothing was said about the rosemary.
On the sidelines, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposed, with rosemary insuffering everything.
It seemed that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary pieces in its lifetime, making meat such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit's foot was attached to a great one, no, just a marked pear in a carmelined crown.
The Palm waffles are offered not only sweet but also raw with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce proved to be too watery, and waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table asked very informally for lunch.
So you should come again.
The dollar has risen to 37 roubles in the MBIB on news of new sanctions being prepared by the West for Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The daily cost of tomorrow's calculation by 10:29 ablutions by 26.9 roubles, was 37.02 roubles, and the euro rate was up by 30 cents, to 48.73 roubles, and the data from the Moscow Exchange show.
The currency basket grew 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 roubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 roubles on 19 February 2009 and 37,005 roubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that President Barack Obama of the United States and Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, coupled with the euro and the dollar.
A long-term forecast suggested this, says Senior Alparist Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumours of military incursions have not been confirmed on any side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was interrupted yesterday.
A week is projected to close at these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine is all one chain.
Inflation is also projected: between 5 and 10 per cent will be added to current prices for autumn.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon end, and there will be a vacuum while the networks are being reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there's no great hysterics," commented the head of the Market Analysis Division, "The Open Broker", Constantine Bushuev.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Rubl, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season had ended, followed by news in Ukraine, and the CB last week stated that by the end of the year, it had completely moved on to a floating rate and had refused any exchange rate.
If you look at day-to-day fluctuations, it's nothing different from the previouss during this month, and everyone's 37 roubles is the one that scares you, and the analyst continues.
Well, nothing big happened in terms of trafficking.
The turbulent times for the currency market were, I recall, when demand for currency rose at the end of January, as well as on March 3, when the CB loaded out a record number of currencies.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of reducing the ruble.
First of all, this increase in income from export operations, as well as the competitiveness of domestic producers through the cost of imports, says chief UFS analyst Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services could be negative.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, stimulate inflationary pressure and thus cause more expensive borrowing, which in turn hinders the country ' s economy.
In terms of the stock market, deprecating the rouble somewhat smooths down the stock prices expressed in the roubles.
For example, the MBI Index fell by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday tender, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative decline in indices is attributable to the reduction of rube during the day by more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy currency.
The practice has shown that emotions are gradually falling apart, and the cutters are partially or completely restoring the lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 roubles per dollar," says Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic violation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after she had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had a disorder called Sharko-Marie-Tuta (SMT), a group of hereditary violations that resulted in damage to the nerve outside the brain and the spine.
The CMT UK charitable organization reported that the misdiagnosed diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because it is so little known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Great Britain are said to have CMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscular weakness, unreasonable footwear and a stinging finger.
The sufferers may experience burnout or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreha (AF) attack, a condition that was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time.
I could never ride on skate or skateboard with other kids, and I had a lot of fun at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release the achill tendon and turn her back on her feet, she looked in the medical records when her doctor came out of the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose down where I shouldn't, so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, I found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information back, I was shocked and tried the most terrible panic I could.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my powers in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you're sick because you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she found SMT.
"When he explained what ITC was, I thought I had pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
A British ITC charity announced a month of information about ITC to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on Washington zone entrepreneurs increases as the economy recovers
The re-establishment economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone were no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The state and local business tax burden increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, which was the third consecutive year of growth after successive years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes grew faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent more than local taxes, according to a study by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young, and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy team.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while it is on firms that make up 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax revenue, proportionately from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the continuing value of the company ' s real estate, say researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states account for a large share of these revenues, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is true in the Washington zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in real estate taxes at the state and local levels last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 an increase of 4.2 per cent compared with the previous year.
However, the observed return of real estate values has no similar effect on the growth of State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the State and Local Tax Accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay the real estate tax," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes to pay for services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the re-establishment of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' incomes also seem to be being adjusted according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion of corporate revenue from income tax, most in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same speed in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below an average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with an equal corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia is lower than its state and local business tax, and generally more favourable in terms of business taxes than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and falling to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could have resulted in an income tax rate for entrepreneurs, even 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to feel better and thus pay more State and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners, a transitional structure that provides for most small firms - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia - grew by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that trends and increases in business tax revenues across the country are likely to continue this year, with revenue from traffic in state and local governments, which increased by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian judo
The judo home championship brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to the assembled Russia.
The Russians gave only the main advantage to Japan’s competition.
The tour in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day he brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan Wiseanov, who spoke in a category of up to 60 kg.
However, in the equal final battle against Baldbaat, Ganbat of Mongolia resolved only one point made by a Russian.
And then the second day of the tournament became the most successful for Russia's assembled -- three medals were conquered on Tuesday.
In male competitions up to 66 kg silver was given to Mikhail Pulaev and bronze to Kamalah Khan-Maghomedov.
In a final alliance, the Russian gave up the 2011 and 2013 peace championship to Japanese Masasi Ebinum.
Khan-Maghomedov, who lost his compatriot in the fourth stage, was victorious in a comforting tournament and became a holder of a bronze prize.
In a women ' s tournament of 52 kg, Natalya Kuzutin also reached the third step of the pedestal.
In the semi-final, she lost the active Peace Championship Mailinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who was under the flag of the International Fed judo and was successful in defending the title.
The Kuzutin bronze dispute won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, it was admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
Again, the barrier to gold from the Russians was Kelmendi, who had defeated Kuzhutin earlier in the finals of the European championship.
On the third day of the tour of Chelabinsk, bronze was placed in a copy of Russia's prefabricated Russia by Moussa Magszkov, who fought in a category up to 73 kg.
In a quarter of his finals, he was offended by the former representative of Moldavia, Victor Skovortsov, who is now in favour of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two matches and became the owner of the prize.
He was in a home championship with a gunpowder he planned to heal shortly, so he'll take a pause in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldivian of Skwertsov, he and he went to the bronze medal on this tournament.
It is interesting that another of his compatriots, who had accepted the AE sports nationality, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, completed a statement in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of CM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze which Ivan Nifontov won up to 81 kg.
In the small finish battle, he won Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a comment from the rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but Russians were traditionally confined to one bronze in a male tournament up to 90 kg.
It was owned by Kirill Question, and Russia’s assembled medal was guaranteed that its rival at a comforting final was Kirill Denisov’s compatriot.
However, there was no interception: the rival Questionu was unable to reach Dad because of the trauma.
The male bronze was conquered by the masters and on the sixth day of the competition, it was placed on a prefabricated strip by Renaiss Saidov, who spoke in the category of over 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he gained a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of world domination.
On the last day of the tour in Chelabinsk, Sunday, the world champions were playing in command competitions.
The two Russian women and men were among the chief candidates for the prize, but as in individual competitions, the women of the beautiful sex were not lucky. They did not reach the medal.
The Russian judoists, on the other hand, had conquered command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they have joined Japan's team in a hard fight against account 2-3.
The Russian assembly led between 2 and 0 following the net victory of Khan-Maghomedov and the left one, Denise Jartsov (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Mourat Habachov (81), Mahomeov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, a bronze match developed in a women's tournament, where a Russian assembler with 2 to 0 took over from Japan - 2 to 3.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was present at the command competitions in Chelabinsk, who, after the end of the tournament, congratulated the male assembly on the silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, quoted by RIA News.
Losing Japanese, judo parents, there's nothing out there.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian national championship was much better off than it was a year ago in the Rio-de Janeiro competitions.
Then there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was passed by the Olympic champions of Arsen Galstan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, great perfectionists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is part of the eight strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in the form of sports such as judo," the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation, Vitaly Mutko, quoted as saying by the champion's press office.
Japan’s assembly was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignitys, five of which proved to be gold.
The next World Championship will be held in Astana next summer.

Joan Rivers’ Family Hopes for the Best
Joan Rivers is unconscious when she arrives at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday, after an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at the Upper East Side Hospital, Yorkville Endoscopi, reports sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under drug control and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from such people as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone can be kings.
The debut album of Royal Blood is a new hope of the British Year, which led rock duets out of the clubs straight into the stadium.
Duét Royal Blood's been on stage for a year, but already has an active nomination for the BBC music prize, a warm-up tour at Archic Monkeys, and a visit to New York concert with Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album, just a few months before the release, had received 100,000 orders, and the contract for its release was in the portfolio of Warner Music.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is leaving a series of boxes, because it's not about the new Lane Del Ray or another sweet-hearing voice representing the new R'n'B, but about the duet of the cattle to the sight of Britishs playing with the volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album rates for all the above circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
Duét had taken a name that they thought might have been affected by before, except for the most desperate hairy metal-plastics, and the blood of which kings seem to have been flowing in their lives is understandable.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the last level of Led Zepelin: like the big quartet, the Royal Blood is designed to catch up with the standing blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It may be early to predict the success of this enterprise, but something can be confirmed.
A dozen songs produced in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composership as a credible and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out of the Black" is characterized by a drum band, not a melodious line.
Musicians tell me that this song is even easier to knock than to drink.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing plate of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy - year party, but when played in a row, they will blend into a more or less uniform canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The power of Royal Blood is that they don't claim the laurels of new Lennon and McCarthy (soonly the successors of Motörhead), but they've got a lot of rock duets out of the Indi Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is designed for stadiums, within a room of less than a few thousand people, and is evidently close.
The secret is in part a subtle use of bass to replace the guitar in a common format developed at the beginning of zero The White Stripes.
But it's not just about the instruments, it's about the way we make the songs.
The heroes of the retrox of the zeros had a hard time moving beyond the post - Modernist paradigm, with a great reluctance to take on the idea of being not just epigons, but self - sacrificing creative units.
The Royal Blood is already so powerful and powerful that it has succeeded in scratching some of the repetitive and hardy music materials.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online shop and video producer, and a hundred other things, buys the Twitch stream video production service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Google's Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and it looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set out to be a flow service of a general nature, a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their inner game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Inside.
Interface Twitch.
And "let's play", a movie genre, where all of us get -- mostly old -- processing games, like in The Mysterious Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is, YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted technology company that buys potential competitors.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at this point is a statement from the executive director of Twitch Emmet Chira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me who say they'll do better sports than watch it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking into their own hands a joystick.
It's one thing to look through a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch someone else get 20 shots in his head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so looking at them without controlling the angle of vision alone can be a recipe for the major pain worth Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed walk where the Rogers of our electronic century end their whole games at record times is fun.
But if it's not a game or humor virtuosis, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How does Amazon make a living?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will come back to Amazon Instant Video as beautifully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
Twitch, however, has something that any company would be happy to have: a crowd of young men who are dreamed of by advertisers.
As Chapter Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not give signs of obsessiveness, even--oh--like a visual sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked to survivors of the hostages -- almost everyone now -- with the parents of the deceased, the cemetery watcher -- the City of Angels, Ramon Kaspolatov, head of Mother Beslan's Committee, Susan Dudiyava, who was involved in a special operation by a member of the Ministry of Health, relates Elizabeth Antonov's Community Correspondent, who worked on a special project.
On their return to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who, 10 years ago, was an adviser to the President in the North Caucasus and engaged in negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the Russian FSB officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic was that there was no such thing as ten years in Beslan.
The topic is extremely painful for all those who have any connection with it, and it is difficult for people to talk about what has happened.
The impressions of travel are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonova said.
A special project has been prepared by a research studio on the holding of the Rambler & Co, which has been working with a company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small-range rocket into the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place about 10:30 a.m. local time by Chagando province, on the border of North Korea and China.
The rocket reportedly fell into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, before the Joint Committee of the Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
The authorities suggested accelerating the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015.
A draft law has been introduced in the State to change the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislation of the lower chamber.
It was co-sponsored by Members of the State of Osdumas Vadim Dydgin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDP), Eugenius Fedorov (“University Russia”), Vladimir Parahin (“Justy Russia”) and Alexander Yushenko (CPRF).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to preserve personal data and to ensure the secrecy of communications and communication networks.
The Act, whose entry into force is hastened by parliamentarians, requires that Russian personal data processed via the Internet be stored in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, refine and extract personal data from Russian citizens in databases located on Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law empowers Roskomnadzor by a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian personal data law.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “black lists” of offenders sites, an automated information system, “Registration of the rights of individuals”.
This law was passed in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Dygin of LDPR and Alexander Yushenko of CPF.
Dasigin and Yushenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have data centres in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill put forward in the State Duma today, the first head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that, by 1 January 2015, would not have their own Russian personal data warehouses in the territory of the Russian Federation would be able to rent them, for example, “Rosetek”, which repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and already provide their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that are already providing their servers”.
“There are also several independent data centres that are willing to cooperate in this area”, he added.
"If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I don't see any problems - they'll get technological accommodations," said Levin.
Probable Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association feared that if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include the services of online air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, “the draft law deprives the entities of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data - by prescribing that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is conducted, to systematize his personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose which territory the said actions will take place.
The adoption of such personal data “localization” bills in other countries has led to global services and significant economic losses.
The bearer of the ice test threw out her jaw.
Izabel Roberts, from Britain, was so screaming when her head was poured out with ice water that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test by a bearer of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried so hard during the test by a bear of ice that she dried her jaw out.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so furiously when her head was poured out with ice water that it damaged her face’s structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did it, my jaw started to get stuck," she said to The Mirror.
There's a 20-year-old water spilling.
Isabelle Roberts a second before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't shut, he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister had the same understanding and had begun to hunt, but I had to be taken to the emergency room without delay.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to hospital to exercise her jaw after taking part in a popular party on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet synssis and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
They handed over over over 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Novorossy Army claims to have shot down Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the detainees handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 soldiers who had died.
This was reported by Interfax's spokesman for the Novorossian Army.
He added that “by air force in the area of Mereska, the Soo-27 aircraft had been bombed and had violated the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in an artillery attack at Luhan airport.
A representative of the press noted that the militia had been able to damage two Ukrainian military helicopters in one of the field airfields overnight, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The loss of life in enemy forces - up to a hundred people killed and injured, 13 people surrendered”, summarized the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of “people's republics” Donbasa announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, during the night, the NAM Army, according to the Novorossy Army, “suffered an attempt by the Nazi people to withdraw heavy equipment from the area, in violation of previous agreements”.
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total casualties of the enemy in all directions (Dottsk, Luhansk, Mariopol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilowayska area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
The NAMA agreed to do so, subject to the surrender of weapons and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozen troops began leaving the surrounding towns on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass, Simeon Semenchenko, another 14 people left on Sunday.
In his Facebook book, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity at the 32-F-32 division and the 9-tank brigade of the Russian Federation”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
FRF Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia will respond if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right of reply to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russia sanctions, and reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Authority states that the European Council's “conclusion” of 30 August demonstrated the failure of EU member countries to overcome their inert support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “exclusively unfounded allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country” on the agency's website.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that, contrary to the interests of its member States, it is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for a full “consistence between the opposing parties”, emphasizing the institution.
Also on the agency website, it is noted that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbasa, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has been launched, and there is also an increasing number of civilian casualties.
We will recall that it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation during the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with United States officials.
It is expected that they will align between the measures introduced for the period of operation and the degree of severity.
The new EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Dying ways to save in university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to move to second grade, came up with a clever way of reducing costs.
It has developed a system of renting books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math study book, which is usually $180, I got on a semester for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
I need literature on the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Colleges Council, an average statistical student spends more than $1200 per year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet cars and creative ideas like Schroeder's.
The sale of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book over the course of the semester, and is often much cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, a company owned by more than 250 university books shops, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Studies in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops were rented during the last spring's semester, says Vice-President, Nibo, Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased at university books stores, according to the professional association of the National Association of University Shops.
Here's an introduction course on better ways to make a good deal.
Buying in an Internet shop
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you're going to see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostettler is worth about $290 on prescurant, but a new copy is available at $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the person held
If you're not against someone else's marks or injuries, the books used are a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasadey, 25, a fourth-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says he paid for Amazon.com 42 cents for a second-hand copy of the book "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding Business for Advertising."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of Collage without Wall at Massachusetts University, Emherst, invite students to clarify from their professors whether they can't use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not essential for class.
In such cases, old publications are often available for a very small percentage of the cost of the latter publication.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Review
It is worth thinking about renting textbooks if you treat them well enough, remember them, and do not want to leave them behind after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" on a semester for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines you may issue for marking, highlighting, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return a book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books rent themselves by acquiring an electronic license for a period of time from distributions such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" pass on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering science can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Holt, the 29-year-old who is about to begin his studies at Pepperin Law School, recommends using ISBN to find out the book prices, as this guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you make an order on the Internet, Holt says, make sure you check if there's a book in the warehouse.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid a full price at the university bookshop.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was fully ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin described at a meeting on the ownership of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, established two years ago, was ineffective, according to Interfax.
"15 billion roubles remain on deposits," emphasized the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested the accelerated approval of the list of territories preceding development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the parties should be introduced into the State Duma in the fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, did not approve until 1 July the list of territories preceding development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also identified key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport accessibility to the region, and removal of infrastructure constraints, both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form areas of pre-development that should become competitive to key APC business centres, the President emphasized.
Recall that it has previously been reported that the territory of advance development can replace the EMS.
Why "Galactic Strikes" couldn't save cash charges
Sylvester Stallon returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, while "The City of Sins: A Woman Who Should Kill" returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
The Home Video with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million on the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to tame dragons 2 are also disappointing.
The article by Telegrapher Robbie Colin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be about bad quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 "the worst" in history with regard to children's films and called "How to tame dragon 2 barely "functioning" by continuing the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at audiences of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily constitute the film itself.
In July,/2008/Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScor and Metacritic for every film that was missed in the summer of at least 2,000 copies between May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both movie viewers and movie critics, suggest that this year's film harvest is similar to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be about changing spectators and the growing popularity of web-based stream services, such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who's currently working on a short-run Russian film called The Jungle Book, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current falls in Hollywood cash charges, Netflix's income from the stream service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spilberg criticized the studios for relying too much on the comics franchise and predicting Hollywood's "cancer."
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that his grim predictions had a share of the truth.
Since several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including “Mities: Era Altron”, “Minonov” and “Juri Park”, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
"Human X" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash charges simply "circular," said a Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten the owners of institutions with Caucasus and Central Asian food, but for European and Japanese kitchen restaurants, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, the general public has so far preferred to replace the prohibited import of products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"Better is a small pickle than a bad masonella," crashing through the Italian Chief Secretary Barlotti Mariano Valerio's restaurant for the quality of raw materials that Italian suppliers offer him in exchange for Italian.
Motzarella and cheese burrata ended in the restaurant first, they've got a little storage time.
The supply of the paramezane must be sufficient for a couple of months.
What do I do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Roadside Market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat was only eight inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
Then I said for our restaurant, we're never going to buy anything from Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe everything's changed there right now.
But the other day, I got a sample of fish from the Far East.
That's how she's turned out to be dead!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
It is surprising to see that many of Italy’s common goods are for a Russian production in a wildebeest.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigeration cell for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang out to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such soft meat?"
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you guys do that?
Five minutes' walk from Barlottti at the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" hangs stop-list on the kitchen containing missing products: French oysters, seafood.
"Brassery Most" and "Streka" Regis Trygel are not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will be bought by Swiss.
In fact, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers, "Captain is 200 rubles!
I said, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make a living, too."
But this hood shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know, how many weights do they weigh?
At the price, it's a super nicety.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of foreign cooks.
The standard story is, "The first three months were all right, then the quality fell off."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many European kitchen restaurants don't know what's going to happen when the cheese supplies end.

Approval menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is mainly referred to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pigs, meat and co-products from domestic birds, meat products, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, figs, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have begun to have chehard with suppliers: food prices have grown, and analogies from other countries need to be urgently sought.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive mono-cooks restaurants in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were brought directly from “material” countries.
The general had to change before.
In early 2014, for example, Rosselhodzor prohibited the import of Australian beef and earlier U.S. and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer-2014 have proved to be much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that outlaws Atlantic salmon and trouts, non-calcosic milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
An Italian named Valerio hopes that sanctions can be reduced further.
Meanwhile, some restaurants exist in a climate of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imports in the dominant segment was 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change menus under what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Myronov, Rector, the owner of RestConstalt.
If the chef's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such cooks, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brassery Most restaurant is ready for this: 10-15% of the food will have to be cut off, half the menu will have to be reworked.
The mixed kitchen restaurants are already beginning to replace dishes, such as marble beef, on beefstrogans, says Sergey Miron.
“The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile”, enumerated by the representative of Oxana Glibchuk, East-West.
The plums and dairy products from Europe have similar products in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway by salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of vegetables and fruit from European production can be compensated by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budgetary network restaurants will be more easily rebuilt than the dominant segment, with gurus capable of distinguishing the Italian monarch from the Russian.
Although it's hard to have Gina Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and from their menus.
It'll take a lot of time to replace it," says Mirons.
In Ginza, comments were refused, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Caucasian and Central Asian kitchen owners stress that products from former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European
But there are a lot of restaurants whose sanctions are practically unaffected.
These include institutions from CIS kitchens: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the coffee shop "Wai Ma!".
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use many of the foods -- chicken fruit, exotic greens."
No dishes have yet been removed from the menu in the institutions of Kolbai.
Timura Lanska, the owner of Chihona N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions are not embarrassing: he's only going to have to change his lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia regulates imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe,” he said.
It is cheaper to get a cut, a lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit from the CIS.
However, what is being brought from Central Asia is far better than a “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Uzbek tomatoes are known to be delicious, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Justice of Uzbekistan, Olymba Artivov, stated that he planned to increase the export of productive products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Restaurants who responded to Deneg's request also respond fairly calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press said that the localization was more than 85% and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the department working with the suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties in the supply of vegetables and rising prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
There was no more than 4% of the "saturation products" in the "Tremk".
They didn't touch the sanctions and the nostalgic Walker.
KFC, Burger King and Little Cartoska did not respond to the Deneg request, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Rectors are prepared to purchase Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On his humpback.
Meanwhile, Rectors complain that demand increases prices even for local products.
"Grabley's products have raised prices by an average of 10-15 per cent, "Cherry Mio's Italian restaurant by twice," says Rector Roman Rozhnikovi.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10 per cent, recognizes Kolbay.
The East-West does not deny, "For example, Belarusian milk products have been traveling 10-15% since early August."
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised the price of pigs almost twice," complains Sergei Rack, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
The chicken fruit was 35%.
We're looking for prices from China, maybe they'll have hot Brazilian heads.
The Stardogs will soon have a projected 8 per cent increase in prices.
It's very undesirable to raise prices now, says Rack.
Statistics show that the increase in total revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest since 2010.
Different prices would continue to rise, but he admitted, but it was not clear how fast it was: as long as most Rectors were stocked with products for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the overrun of purchase prices.
But what's gonna happen in two months is nobody knows.
In front of the city of Moscow, there are dozens of tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a festival of regional products called "There's Time."
"We've long been going to celebrate local food, and here's just sanctions, we're in a hurry, we're organizing a festival," says one of the organizers.
On stage with Greek cook Anastas, he prepares macaron salads and household confetas, and during the days there was a workshop for preparing a box with carameled apples.
All Russian products, the organizers believe.
The tent is an exhibition of Russian people's economic achievements.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from Lenin's Pompeii, cheese from J. Claus' fallen Italian.
"For restaurants, another salmon fish can be replaced peacefully from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of the fish store, “His own people.
We're going to have Nerves, Cats, Booves, peas, Chewices, King's Salves.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You hold him in your hands, he doesn't even move.
And our Far East salmones you can't hold.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian monarch with a domestic one.
In the shade of his tent lies shrimp with a beaker of Magadan, cobbler, umol, martyrs, copper from Crimea, crackers from the Far East.
Galkin is sure it's high time to go fishing from the Far East.
Statistics show that Russian fishing in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, and that a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
Lavka "His People" has been working since 2012, selling fish via an Internet shop, serving another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simplified Things" before the sanctions were imposed.
There are now 15 more restaurants to Galkin.
The same land may well be made from our fish, and it is hot.
We're frozen, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling sushi over an Internet car for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared for the rescue of the Philadelphia with the cat.
Unlike the rales of seed, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish, our domestic fish, is exerting power.
On the website of the "His People" bench, there's even the rolls of the armpit and the sea-scraper.
In Sushi bar, it's true that they'll replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean.
Galkin explains this by making new prescriptions for distant fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," gives an explanation to the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Evisev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take up the freed niche, but that does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, it is now possible to talk more about the substitution of imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and high volumes.
They are able to quickly replace illicit imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is to say the ban will be won primarily by the big producers of other countries," Akimov says.
In addition, the restaurant industry received a more disturbing signal in the last month than food sanctions.
As a result of extensive extra-planned inspections, Russia has temporarily suspended the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
“We are examining the nature of the claims filed to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated Dengam in the McDonald's Press Service.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is restricted by food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous worker in a restaurant consulting company.
If we start closing McDonald's all over the country, then the script will be different.
“Europrotocol” instead of a HGDD reference
The caste payments will be available without a GIEDD certificate, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of “europrototocol” in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft guidelines according to which, since 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a GIDD certificate.
This is true only in cases where the accident was carried out on “europrotocol” without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit, and both drivers agreed on who was the perpetrator of the accident.
From 2 August, the “europrotocol” payment limit is roubles 50,000, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that, often even with minor damage, in a situation where accidents can be formed through a “europrotocol”, drivers who are in an accident are causing a DFS.
If there was a policy, no reimbursement could be made for it without a HGDD certificate.
The parameters outlined in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of “europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum helmet payment for an accident made without HGDD personnel should not be lower than the limit for a “europrotocol”.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the insurance policy.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the staff of the DFS and the roads.
But it is likely that no motorists or insurers will delight in it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of a new policy on caste payments.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work would have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will in most cases wait for hours for an inspector to report a minor accident because it's more reliable.
And it's not clear that it's easier to defeat fraud or convince drivers of the reliability of the Europrototocol.
The saving certificate will make the nameless and irrevocable
The Minfin wants to ban savings certificates on the bearer, but he will allow banks to make them the equivalent of irrevocable contributions.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates for the bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity because the stakes are higher than bank deposits.
The point is that savings certificates are not entered into the deposit insurance system and the bank is cheaper because they do not have to be credited to the deposit insurance agency (ERA).
The pictivity of the situation is that this step is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will be affected by it by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the professional market.
The Agency estimates that the share of the Bank of Moscow is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, as explained in AER, is that the customers of a small bank who have bought such a certificate are trying to get money from the AER if it is withdrawn.
Some investors may assume that their investments are insured without sufficient financial literacy and by purchasing savings certificates for bearers.
The justified lack of insurance payments for these certificates if the licence is withdrawn from the bank could lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of agencies, there have been cases where bearers have attempted to recover insurance compensation through the court”, as stated in ASA.
The problem, of course, is mind-blown.
After all, there will be no one to pay certificates to buyers because they have no legal right to reparation from the State.
If it had been the case that the instrument was not insured by AER, it would have been prohibited with it the metal accounts in which citizens ' funds were recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts do not fall into the deposit insurance system either, but they do not yet exist.
It is likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient securities, which can actually serve as a quasidden.
In so doing, their movement is almost out of control: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and prior to exposure, such a certificate can replace a large number of owners.
It is not unusual for the bill to state that the savings certificate must be the very securities that must be held in the depository.
In order to send the saw to banks, such certificates are permitted to be issued without prior payment.
I mean, there's an equivalent of an irrevocable contribution long dreamed of by bankers.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nuporta and Cardiff
The weekend included protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport on a march against NATO.
On Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff Hall for what was described as an anti-sammit.
Stephen Fairclay followed us through the weekend and spoke to the protestors from all over Belgium, from Brigend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will put weapons in Iraq to counter terrorist militia “Islamic State” on 31 August, referring to the decision taken at the meeting of representatives of the Government of the FWG led by Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Germany is reported to have sent 30 portable anti-tank missile systems, Milan and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles, to Iraq.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided that an additional Euro50 million should be allocated to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement in the Bundestag on this subject.
So far, Germany has not placed its weapons at hot spots.
The view of the population of the FRG regarding the shipment of weapons to Iraqis has been divided.
Some believe that it is only in this way that the “Islamic State” fighters can be stopped; others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
A Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea was bombed by the militia
Donets militia shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting ITAR-TASS on 31 August.
According to available evidence, this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the settlements of Shirokino and Unanino (10-20 km east of Mariupola).
A number of Ukrainian media report the shooting of two coast guard boats.
It is clear that the incident took place today at around 4:20 pm.
Adolescents were taken from the Blue Mountains by helicopter
DURING the night, a two-year-old Bushuker was caught in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales on a helicopter at a safe place.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set out for camp shortly after noon on Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team comprising the local police and rescue unit was dispatched, and a couple found around 11 a.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up at the swan on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Moontins Hospital in a stable state.
Two Unions met
The Minsk summit negotiations did not solve the problems for which they had been convened but gave birth to a new format: the first European Union people met with the first people of the Eurasian future
Let the concerns (the situation around Ukraine has not been delayed), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union have for the first time discussed a number of “heavy issues”.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is not clear; however, it is clear who has removed the spills from this summit.
Questions fell back on that occasion on the evening of 26 August when Belarusians followed by other Eurasians with Europeans saw President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader was an example of a marked consideration; it was the behavior of a man who had just broken a jackpot -- and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Midan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to give a final briefing on their behalf, not just the legalization of the President with 20 years of service.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and as the principal Motor of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Meliantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met Tet-a-tet with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue," he said, "the fire.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began long before November ' a.m. in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“There have been results also with the EU — successful negotiations on the simplification of visa and readmission, dialogues on modernization —” enumerates the interlocutor, “The fire”, and negotiations on international security have been held with the United States.
The United States has even lifted a bit of sanctions.
As far as Ukrainian events were concerned, they themselves and the response of the leaders of Belarus had only sped up the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain relations with Ukraine -- warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Porosenko could come to Belarus to negotiate.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea ' s accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russ militia in Donbasa with all severity, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk has neither left the Customs Union nor the DTCO, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it - and were confident of Belarusian experts.
The success of Lukashenko's movement towards political diversification will be seen by how often Minsk will soon be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected of the relationship in the new format.
The Spokesperson, Ashton Maya Kosyančić, merely stated that, against the backdrop of war and peace issues, the theme was not a priority.
It was reported, however, that Kazakhstan could also be the next place for a meeting on the Ukrainian question with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The Deglay for Minsk became a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked by the European Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties would not object to Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings, both in the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” has become a fully competent European leader who helps solve the global problem.
The Best Friend of a European Farmer
The EU delegation itself, which included the European Commissions on Trade and Energy, had already led to the conclusion that the main background of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbasa, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting's timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and for addressing the concerns of TC countries on an agreement on Ukraine's association with the EU is more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner, Karl De Güht, nevertheless, indicated that EU representatives had “come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that had economic consequences, not vice versa”.
It seems, however, that in Ukraine's economy, the crisis will “work” in Belarus.
Its consequences, particularly mutual sanctions of the West and Russia, have been given to Minsk, who is so far under sanctions, a long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mizez Research Centre, ex-candidate to the President of Belarus, Yaroslav Romancuk, European investors are actively interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation to circumvent sanctions.
Supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit burned Minsk.
"Initiators of these schemes," stressed Romancuk, "The Fire," not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked on supply patterns, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
The Russian business urgently needs some sort of rehabilitation, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are committed to the establishment of Ukrainian raw materials production in Belarus, also directed towards the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very needed.”
According to Romanchuca, the role of the EU and TC negotiating ground is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the sanctions of Moscow were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission had currently offered only Euro125 million of compensation to the Agrarians.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on the euro-farmers.
This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality Without Initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format is revealed, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev had initiated the new format.
“It was your offer to meet, without any effort to discuss, not from the Barat Bay to take a decision after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to investigate the situation that had taken place in Ukraine at that time”, he addressed Peter Porosenko to the Chambers.
On the other hand, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially opposed to Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, Belarus has worked hard to emphasize that Belarus, in organizing EU-TC engagements on its land, has no beneficial purpose, and the ultimate objective of such a format is to establish in the future a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is in the spirit of concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, lead and promote the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation”, said the Ogonku in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency where words have recently been carefully chosen.
There may be paid-entry areas in Moscow
The Government of Moscow views the introduction of paid-entry zones as a method to control the congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, and passes M24.ru, referring to the Moscow Deputy Transport Officer Maxim Liksutov.
Pay entry is one option that has been successful.
This is an expert opinion, and we're going to study it, and we're going to look at all the minuses and benefits.
To tell you that there's been a decision on this before it's too early," Liktout told the Liktouts.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and load to Moscow, is of great importance to the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already under way construction of a central ring road, adding Liksutov.
The recently started construction of the Central Wheel Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessarily necessary for all traffic to pass through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure to go around, there would have been no need for transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zamora.
Also, Maxim Liksutov stated that the introduction of payment parking had significantly cleared the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to dwell on what has been achieved.
Recall that on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobian, participated in the construction ceremony of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Wheeled Road (CACCA).
A Sinful Grieve
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's "The City of Sin 2: A Woman for Whom to Kill" have made the wrong revolution.
The first City of Sin (2005), with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized relations between movies, comics and literary Nuar.
Sikvel is also revolutionary in the sense that he destroys the fundamental thinking chain of "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" today.
It should now read “thesis - antithesis - chaos”.
The City of Sin 2 is chaotic at both the playwright and the philosophical level: it's both messy in the stupid sense of words.
Yes, some heroes are familiar with the first "Chord," though Marv (Mickey Rurk), remembers, he's finished his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, but he's able to bring -- as this folk wife -- out of the air of the knives and other widowers.
But the old people are literally pushed by the elbows of newcomers, like they're breaking into the city from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, my story, which has been shamelessly torn by the authors at the most interesting place, is that of Johnny's superb player (Joseph Gordon-Lavitt).
Her own is from the lusty-fried Eva Lord (Ewa Green) and for something vengeful to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight's face is not different from Johnny's -- especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are being subjected to inexorably regularity -- not trouble, not even half victory.
They're not people, we realize they're archetypes of nura: a rock bitch, too confident of a player who's caught in the "med trap" of a sex detective, a corrupt roach-sensor.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases, it's no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the story.
Besides, even in this sad world, there's something permanent.
Battle whores from the first "Horod" continue to defend themselves in a round manner against the dark forces of their native slums.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of "The City of Sins 2" is another one.
Frank Miller was good at putting a comic book and a noir together as a painter, and as a director, he turned his mind about how to put comic books on the screen.
Comics and Nuar are two aggressive opposites of reality.
The comic book phenomenon was born today in the late 1920s, while the novels of Dashil Hammet's blood-gray (1929), the Maltese falcon (1930) and the Glass Key (1931) created a canon of nuar, then known as hard-boiled school, which was a “closure school”.
Or pulp fiment.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, ranging from the Popai sailor to the spinach, which gave him wealthier power, Superman, Batman, and Syscar Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider Man and other vigilantes.
But in any comic film, something was wrong: the figures who were painted were determined not to grow the screen flesh, they were still acting in their surrounding will-free world.
Simply put, they were simply devoid of “exclusivity”.
On the contrary, the most exotic genre of world literature.
After world wars, traditional novels -- experiences, characteristics, family scandals and historical background -- lost all credibility.
What are the Fors web sites, which Tibo and Rugon-Makcara, which even Bolkonsky and Rostov think after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
The novel was peacefully mutated into soap opera, and the criminal -- that is, by definition, marginal -- the novel was raised to the level of a philosophical prize.
Hammett on his skin found out what it was like to work as a health worker on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, by the way, there were at least close to the company and the gent's pillars, such as writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawy, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nur, the archetype of which they gave, first, is rude and cynical, and second is purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first City of Sin was marked by something that was unnatural, but organicly linked the comic book to the Nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive, not being ashamed of its graphics nature, but pretending to be a "present" movie.
The darkness of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the monstrous son-adult, was quite worthy of the crossing of Hammet.
And the paintings are kind of cut-off heads, which the sadist decorated with his nest, the pen of genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best -- that is, the declarative tones, the neonaire's representative.
The City of Sin 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stalist -- Rodriguez before the comical tradition.
This must have been largely due to 3D technologies.
When you look at the second City of Sin, you feel like a prisoner in a glass balloon where snow falls into a toy bed.
In fact, it's not usually snow, it's blood shoes, but what's the big difference?
It's about sociality and nothing to say.
Because it's only possible when, somewhere in the world, we sometimes have a muddy swamp on our shoulders, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl's curved track or, say, say, say, say, tell your desperate parents that the destroyer is punished.
But when there is no place in the city for sin except sin, then sin is no more a sin than a standard.
It's boring, like any standard.
The chaos of "The City of Sins 2" is boring.
Justice for the sake of domestic passing gave this freshwater sin a small but small ring.
The Titans warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to maturity, in the very vegetarian episode of which a man's fingers are broken, this gives a hell of a humor.
Hammeta would love it.
The French socialists must "shut up and set up France," says the key ally, Frasua Olland.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “show a warm attitude” towards the socialist President who had been attacked, whose diversions had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, deserves our loyalty, and deserves our support.
"It is our duty--to stay close to him," he said, calling out applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister believed that his Government would not question the disputed 35-hour work week in France, despite proposals that were inflammatory, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Oldland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “single” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels by bringing to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and critical of the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pé, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Wall's Government would last for more than a few months.
François Alland is a nude king, but nude and Prince Manuel Valle, who is forced to gather a new government when summer did not last.
"And the new one won't last a fall or winter," Mrs. Le Pen said to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win the early elections and would manage.
The ruling party of France suffered a breakdown in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believed that the Socialist Party was in danger of breaking into several competing factions before the end of Mr. Alland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Ciance Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel that something's changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
"The City Without Drugs" has been left without a claim
The Sverdlov Arbitration Court left without consideration the Regional Ministry's decision-making authority for the management of the State of the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The authorities intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent charges for the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsk Court of Arbitration has left without consideration a claim from the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (MIGASO) to the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is Mayor of Ekaterinburg, Evgenius Rosesman).
The regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent charges.
It is now known that the plaintiff has not appeared before a court twice, which has led to the decision not to appear.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the MUGISO Directorate was unable to explain, the Chief of Legal Affairs, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to contact representatives.
Remember, this is a girl who has been a foundation in the city centre on the streets of Belinsky, 19 since 2011 on a free basis.
That decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Ministry of Public Property Management of Sverdlov District filed an action with the Sverdlov Arbitration Court to evict the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the agency required, through the court, that the grant contract be recognized as non-concluded by the premises of the monument.
In the view of the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not record significant conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlov arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim and an appeal was filed with the 17th Court of Arbitration, which was granted.
The Fund then filed an appeal against the decision before the same court, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took a stand for the decision.
A new lease contract was concluded in 2013 and the fund began to pay rent again, as described by Evgeny Rysman, head of the city.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous district administration handed over this building to us for free of charge, recognizing our counter-narcotics merit, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he stated.
Tatiana Draev, Ekaterinburg
Why Mayor Ekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Hallowie Ekaterinburg's unicornist, Alexander Kosinitz, proposed that the mayor of the city, the Speaker of the Mountain, Evgenia Royzman, resign.
The case involved a criminal case involving a retired retired man, Oleg Kinev, a retired member of the Mayor ' s Office, who is considered to be a partner of the mayor.
How Evgenia Roseman was found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been instituted in connection with the fact of “cleta” (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) on the blog of the Mayor of Ekaterinburg, Evgenia Royzman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, where Anna Filatova, Director of the Legal Centre for Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roseman had accused her of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-wife on her blog.
The Mayor of Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is an ordinary attempt to avenge the truth."
The iPhone will turn into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple has to present his new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
Referring to sources, the American media report that the sixth generation of iPhone would be equipped with a mobile purse as a result of the joint Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express project.
According to Blogberg and the Re/code specialized Internet resource, a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express could be announced in 9 September Apple’s presentation of new products, which would make the mobile purse available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on a store account by means of a smartphone.
The payment identification will be made by the user on his finger fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
The iPhone is said to be the first to incorporate the NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows direct payment by means of a smartphone and a suitable reading device on the counter.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Simiconductors).
The first function of NFC was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Simiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, an association to advance this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the function of NCC - Samsung Nexus S was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google submitted a Google Wallet system that allows users to attach bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, U.S. experts stress that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, U.S. Ritlers are still careful about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops by such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple ' s entry into this market will still make it possible for the Ritlers to accelerate and increase the deployment of this technology at their trading points.
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Paris' position regarding the supply of Mistrals to Russia does not change
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, Romen Nadal, stated that Paris was in a constant position regarding the delivery to Russia of the Mistral type of helicopter.
“I may recall a statement by the President of the Republic (Fransua Allanda) in his interview with Le Monde of 20 August: “The level of sanctions today does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," quotes Mr. Nadaly as “RIA Novosti”.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department responded to the question as to whether the deterioration in the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris' position to implement the contract

Council of National Security of Ukraine: seven military personnel have died in the area of military operations in the past 24 hours
The representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, Andrei Lisenco, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the fighting zone in the eastern part of the country during the previous 24 hours, while another 25 had been injured.
The situation under Iloway is extremely difficult.
Until the withdrawal of troops is completed, details will not be announced.
The loss data and the reasons for the situation will be made public at the end of the operation.
The perpetrators of such a situation would bear responsibility," Mr. Lishenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in greater detail under Iloway, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of the SNB, “every effort is being made to return troops who have been captured”, says ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lisenko also noted that Ukrainian military personnel had departed from Lugansk airport in the direction of the settlement of Georgia.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations on the acquisition of a similar company, Presige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion reported by people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norway Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the "lux" class and secured customers of Preside Cruises, as it competes with larger rivals of the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CLC.N).
An agreement could be announced earlier this week, informing sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Preside Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the shares of the North African Cruise.
Sources asked to remain unnamed, as negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwayan Cruise and Preside Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than one year earlier.
It is expected that the growth of the average class in developing economies, such as China and India, will benefit from the 29 billion-dollar cruise industry in subsequent years.
Race companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for primary public equity in January 2014.
Apollo became the principal shareholder of the company after $850 million in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by GENT.KL, a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned 28 per cent shares, Apollo owned 20 per cent shares, and TPG Capital LP owned 8 per cent shares in the company, according to the accounts at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public location of Prestige Cruises.
Krem can receive 250 million roubles of grants
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russia proposes to allocate 250 million roubles to the State Radio Company in 2014.
As can be seen from the draft Minsk Decree, which is posted on a one-stop portal to disclose the preparation of regulations, subsidies are intended to be spent “to cover the costs of creating conditions for wide-ranging information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of the current information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
Money will also be used to purchase equipment, repair roofs and power systems in a television station based in 1959, reports RIA News.
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement withdraw the statement of the Chinese representative the day after the election decision is taken
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress on Sunday decided on a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of Hong Kong ' s leader in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of the majority of members of the nominating committee, which is likely to be captured by the Pekinis.
The decision made it almost impossible for democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and made democratic activists promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre by protesting Occupy Central.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing ' s publication of China ' s control of Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and organized a sit-in strike.
Li briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress of China, Jeang Rongsung, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council of Feng Wei were also required to give a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would meet at the head of Government of Hong Kong building in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they intended to join 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The occupation of territory by the Israeli Ministry of Defence was announced on Sunday and mandated by the military to establish an administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikata, world public opinion should hold Israel accountable for “the ongoing settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to begin negotiations on the “State” of Eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separation region.
His Spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean to suggest that the Eastern Territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine must be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russia rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that it followed since the beginning of the massacre five months ago: to help the separatists take away the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to grant the newly announced Novorossi territory actual independence in order to get closer to Russia than to the West.
In an interview with State First Television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory held by separatists in eastern Donetsk and Luganese regions, which was captured in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the seized territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the ITAR-TASS, reported.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy that had been discussed with leaders in Kiev for months in an attempt to calm down fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the Eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Spokesperson of Kremlin to correct the “false interpretation” of Putin's words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist rebellion in the east in a way other than the open capture of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russian residents, and interviews before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would empower regional Governments in Ukraine to define trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact handing over to the Kremlin actual control over territory that would unite Russia ' s main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical marine resorts.
Mines, factories and Lithuanian factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army are also located in the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea.
Ukrainian President Peter Porosenko proposed during his inauguration on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, weigh constitutional amendments to allow more control over their finances and language status to be exercised by the separate regions.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose armament and instigation are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equal, followed the new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-supported separatists have taken control of Novoazowsk in an attack that Ukrainian security officials say is afraid to be the beginning of a campaign to capture strategic coastal territory until Crimea.
This has led to extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupoli, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, between the Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimea Peninsula.
The meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels was called upon on Saturday to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warned Porosenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 troops last week had entered the Donetsk region to support separatists who were in difficulty, Colonel Andrey Lisenko, and the Ukrainian Press Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council had reported to reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago and reported to Lsenko on Sunday.
The naked scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffry Edelstein expressed his disgust for hackers who may have stolen naked photographs of his bride Gabi Greco and a complete list of the needles of the Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was indignant after a series of frank photographs depicting Jennifer Lawrence, who was exposed to the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 open photographs of the Food Games Lawrence and Superstars, including Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, Rianna singers, Arian Grande and Lia Michel, and Kirsten Dunst actress.
Australian actors, Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski, and living in Melbourne, also believed to have stolen photographs as a result of a leak from iClaude.
List 101 is the name of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who made Greco last month's proposal, said, "This is disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
Tragically, personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "silent" and that those to whom it was directed "hears they've invaded them."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photographs of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Spidman, including two frames, where she lies in the naked pool.
Palmer's work in the movie includes Love and Honor, along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of "Chac" Strakhowski and actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on stolen photos.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ, "It's just an invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, wrote on Twitter: "To put out photographs stolen from the cell phone is in fact no different from the sale of stolen goods."
It's just from a legal point of view that you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
Potential method of theft of photos of naked celebrities detected
The mass hacking of star accounts may have been made because of the vulnerability of Find My Phone.
A potential scenario for events described The Next Web resource.
The Gitub resource published a Python script that allows you to select passwords to the Find My Phone Service of Apple.
This service allows tracking the iPhone location.
It uses the same link between the logic and the Apple ID password as the Apple iClaude cloud, from which photographs of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed you to learn the password from Find My Phone.
In this way, every possible combination of characters is consistently introduced, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author claimed that in the Find My Phone service, the number of passwords entered was unlimited.
When the security system is correctly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be locked and reported to the user that the hacking attempt has been attempted.
Because of vulnerability, users did not receive any reports of an attempt to obtain a password for their account.
The hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access iClaude.
According to a Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to select passwords.
At present, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the “star” account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister resubmitted foreign records
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability in the Find My Phone has been used for the theft of photographs, there has been a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that in this case cloud safety had not been compromised but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
The Russian Federation had also previously been hit by Twitter from the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev.
If the abusers have gained access to iCloud as described above, the password for the head of government account in the micro-blogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-assembly
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Burak.
The decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent residence and asked the Federation of a modern five-borrow to give her an opportunity to speak in favour of a collective Russian Federation.
In 2013, it won two phases of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European championship in personal life, and became the champion of the world in a mixed estaphet, which is one of the new types of sport.
It maintains leadership positions during the current season.
According to the rules, in order to address the Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, it will need special authorization from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Burak was not the first Ukrainian athlete to change nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Shahmatist Ekaterine Laggen, a Luvovian mother-in-law who is a two-fold champion of Europe (2005, 2008), a world of blizzard (2010) and a fast chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete was a winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the team championship of peace in Astana (2013) and the European team championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR stopped investigating disaster Tou-204 in Vnukov
The Russian Investigative Committee (RCC) stopped criminal proceedings for the accident of the Tow 204 aircraft Red Wings.
This is what the agency's press service reports.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of an aircraft commander and a aircraft engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the disaster was caused by an increased landing speed, failure by the crew to comply with standard landing procedures, and unintentionally entering the engines into increased direct driving speed.
A Toe-204 plane by Red Wings on the Prague Moscow flight occurred on 29 December 2012 when it landed at Vnukov airport in Moscow.
The airship flew over the runway and set fire to fire.
An aircraft commander, a second pilot and a pilot were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to health facilities, where the injuries subsequently resulted in their death.
Three other flight attendants who were hospitalized with serious bodily injuries received long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle was seriously injured at the time of the disaster on the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers on board an aircraft.
The Transport Prosecutor ' s Office conducted a follow-up examination in Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko started training in SIZO
The well-known Russian mixed style fighter Alexander Eméllianenko, 33 years old, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual violence against a domestic worker, has fully recovered from injuries and has started training.
That's what the World Cup says.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexandra Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted, detained in Tambowe on 9 May following his accident, which resulted in a broken thigh.
Emellianenko, Jr., was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the detention until 30 September.
If the athlete's fault is proved, he is liable to imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
Lenta.ru remembers the most scandalous stories in his career as Alexander Emelianenko.
Emellianenko spent his last team in January this year, losing a technical knockout by his compatriot, Dmitri Szovsky.
Alexander is a younger brother of a more famous fighter named Fedor Emelianco.
The latter is a four-fold world champion of mixed martial arts, four-time world championship and seven-time Russian war samba championship.
Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional human emotion
The facial expression is biologically universal for mankind, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not an accident but an additional means of expressing power and threat, as scientists in Australia and the United States have discovered.
They described their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face -- the eyed and down-drived eyebrows that are stretched into the thin line of the lips, the swollen nostril -- is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth, children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major study project on anger nature, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes in times of conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more ability he has to dictate his terms, and the more he will bring it to the householder by means of anger.
The researchers also found evidence of other hypotheses: physically powerful people are more likely to get angry and become involved, feel they have the right to impose adverse conditions on others, and prefer violent methods of conflict resolution for peaceful purposes.
In view of the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of the tender”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create angry facial expressions should be more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, thus making it possible to accept its conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer persons where each of the seven elements of the angry person was present or missing and showed them to the informers.
Although the dropped eyebrows or the forward chin did not individually make the person evil, the stronger physical participants in the study, depicted with such characteristics as man, recognized that they were united.
Like animals, man’s anger poses a threat: an exaggerated display of his own strength, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man crushes his nostril and whines his lips for the same purpose as a cobbler, or baboon, who demonstrates his name.
“Gnus `starts' by refusing to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that best demonstrates the consequences of the refusal.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same expression,” noted Anthropologist John Tubi.
Mincoma proposed to allocate 250 million roubles to the Crimea Company.
Mincoma proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-profit organization Krim in 2014.
This is referred to in a draft government decree prepared by the agency “Lenta.ru”.
According to the explanatory note to the project, federal budget grants will be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for the wide-ranging information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of the current information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, the funds allocated are expected to be converted to the hardware and studio unit, videos, central hardware and video server.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic line (WALS) and maintenance of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The State broadcaster Krim was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula has been broadcast by television.
In 2011, Tele-Rady Company Krem obtained a digital television license.
