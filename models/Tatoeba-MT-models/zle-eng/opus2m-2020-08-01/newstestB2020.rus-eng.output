That's how my whereabouts were tracked.
I'll notice I wasn't confined to movement.

Paul Mogilevitz, the Rubina Lieutenant, described the reasons for the team's failure.
The Kazanese in the Russian championship suffered four consecutive injuries and also left the Cup.
We're setting up for every game, and we're quoting Mogilev's "Iducation."
Therefore, each of us needs to consider the reasons for such failed matches.
We'll have to prepare for them and fix the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably be corrected.
But first of all, I think we need to add a component like unity.
I think we have problems with that.
The Kremlin supports the ban on smoking in the balconies of residential homes
The Kremlin supports any measures that will save lives, as stated by President Dmitri Peskov's Spokesperson, commenting on the ban on smoking in the balconias and lods of apartments.
In the past, the cabmin had approved amendments to the Fire Control Regulations, which prohibited the use of open lights in the balconies and living rooms.

The changes will enter into force on 1 October 2019.
There is administrative liability for the violation.
In the Kremlin, any decisions that help save lives are positive.
"We know how many fires occur, many of which have tragic consequences and social impact.
So any life saved justified such decisions," Peskov said.
First of all, the Spokesperson views this as a firefighter rather than a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not welcome smoking and was a supporter of a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the “Tybei Bill”
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called Taliban Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
That was stated by the official representative of the Office of the Gossovet of the PRC for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguán on Friday.
The approval by the United States Senate Committee for International Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and basic principles of international relations and gross interference in China ' s internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguán.
According to him, Taiwan was part of China and related issues related to China ' s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, to stop immediately from advancing the relevant negative bills, and to cease immediately to intervene in the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to China-American relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be stopped by anyone and by no means, as Ma Xiaoguán emphasized.
TikTok hides unfavourable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese Social Network TikTok has censorship videos that mention Tianmanen Square, Tibet Independence, or Falungun Religious Group, reports The Guardian.
The documents in the publication tell us that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) promotes China's foreign policy objectives abroad by means of an application.
The majority of violations of China's policy fall under the “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant publications in a context suitable for general rules, so that the activities of the social network do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system in China falls under the general prohibition of “criticalness or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The prohibition on the mention of incidents in Tianman Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “probation of China's history or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of 20 “Foreign leaders or public figures”, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Ira, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian policy of Mahatma Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Park King Hee, President Joko Vidodo of Indonesia and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as described in the document.
The publications in the first category are removed by social network administrators and may cause the user to lock down.
Not too strict are the second categories: such publications remain on the website, but their dissemination is limited to the TikTok algorithms.
The representative of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied, "Now we use a localized approach and we attract independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on the publication, and the co-founder of Rustem Bogdanov's "Peducer Center".
The Preducer Centre is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All bloggers' ads are in agreement with the social media, but users can be placed without agreement, passing on to the Bogdans.
Asked whether TikTok could speak of politics or Putin, the Bogdans answered yes and said that they had seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user's agreement: it is not possible to state shocking content, discriminatory statements, etc.”.
But under these rules, any content that the processors don't like can be summed up by Zaripov.
Zarypova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
By user agreement, TikTok may only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
Social media administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: Neurosity analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, tells the Bogdans.
If it decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the Kovorking WeWork.

Russia warned of false calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters was increasing, replacing the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commmersant with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted more than 25,000 numbers to the communication operators, calling the clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked and, in 59 cases, restrictions on the use of financial services were imposed.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department, CB Artem Sychev, reported that a wide range of Russian banks had been replaced by a replacement number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings of fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such an obligation in the Communication Act.
The opening bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in the number of false calls replacing the number.
According to the White Press Service, part of the information on fraudulent calls transmitted by the CB was not correct: the lists had numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would have resulted in disruptions in the organization.
Artem Sychev explained that Centom Bank was planning to establish a fraud number base to which a communications operator would address each call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

This was described during a speech at Columbia University in New York City.

This was reported on Friday, 27 September, by the Co-President of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinitz.

Chegrinitz said that Green was a good actor for him, but he was a bad politician.

Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" blackmailes Neimar
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former football player, Brazilian Neimar, are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the French attacker Parry St. Herman.
The case was almost tried, but the Catalans suggested that the player resolve the dispute without Femida's intervention.
Otherwise they refuse to return to him.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also an agent of Brazil, had an interesting focus: according to an agreement with Barsoy, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive Euro40 million.
However, just one year later, the forward was at the TFG for the record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In fact, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When Naymar's claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
Blue Grants insist that the bonus relied on the performance of the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that only a quarter of the Euro40 million was held by the player and that the proportional part of the first payment is required.
But what's most interesting is that in the summer Neimar and Barsa, almost agreed to the return of the "cold" player in Catholnia's bosom.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope of a return journey of the Forward remains.
As reported by Sports. Ru, referring to the investors, the lawyers of the club stated to the player that if the issue of financial claims was not settled in a pre-trial manner, this would rule out the possibility of the Brazilian being returned.
Neimar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

How to increase the future pension and not recycle
It is possible to pay a pension not only to the Russian Federation Pension Fund but also to pay non-State pension funds.
The NPF is private companies, says Volgograd Truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time gives you back interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about the NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules as those laid down in federal laws.
Pension points can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you do not have to pay your pension.
This is a way for those who worked informally.
In addition, a contribution may be made for a relative, such as a housewife.
Recommendation for those who consider retirement at the beginning of their employment.
The increased pension benefits are received by government officials, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a number of years in the regions of the Great North.
Take care of this in advance so as not to be denied retirement age.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.

A man with a samurai sword tried to protect a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of the American city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after having rocked his opponent with a samurai sword in a dispute on account of a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Harris Miller was digging into a pile of garbage outside a waste house.
This was observed by Todd Bivers (Todd Beavers) on his evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the discards.
Miller saw Beaver's finding and was upset.
He thought he could claim to be on the TV because he was the first to dig in the trash.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bivers grabbed the cart and ran with it toward his house.
Then Miller took the sword he found in the same pile of samurai and began to persecute the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers at his house.
Miller pulled a sword out of his leg and began waving it in the direction of the thief's cart.
Bivers told Miller that what happened was recorded on the video.
After seeing the video camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Bivers left a cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw a strange woman coming into his yard and taking her cart and shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller to drive without his rights.
The man was detained and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in Hardiston, New Jersey, U.S.A., a hedge fund manager attacked a woman unknown and wounded her with a sword.
He thus responded that the guests at the wedding held at the same hotel where he stayed were not allowed to smoke.
Massacres on the Three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests, the more likely it is to break apart and lose political fill.
The evidence of “mass riots” does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to lower this brake case, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of charges.
The collapse of the case should encourage society, but it would certainly leave the violent men whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots), Alexei Minailo, was unexpectedly released without any obligation, and several hours later, he was fully rehabilitated: the SCR dropped his charges.
The past two months of detention were followed by a number of professional communities, such as historians, priests, and literarys.
The case was then followed by only two accused of involvement in riots (usually 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samaddin Rajabov, who was subsequently extended by the court until the end of December (he is also accused of violence against a representative of authority, article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The Court sentenced the author of the joking petition to join the United States of America
The Wojdzem District Court of Riga sentenced the author of the ludicrous petition to join the United States of America, Denis Barteski.

"Health meaning is not the strongest part of our system," commented the Court's decision.
He added that punishment is usually less than it is asked for.
The collection of signatures of Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, along with this petition, Latvia's signatures of accession to the “Galactic Empire” and the withdrawal of the country from the Solar System and the Milky Way were collected on the website.
It is noted that criminal proceedings have been instituted against the Bartekskyov under the first paragraph of article 82 of the country's Criminal Law, “Popular appeal for the subversion of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia ' s accession to Russia received six months ' imprisonment.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the Police Act in order to protect detainees from the spread of libel and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal legal portal, and the draft instrument itself had not yet been published.

Will phytosterrogenes and phytoandrogenes help to prolong youth?
The subject of the phytoandrogens has been poorly examined.
One of the best known is pine dust.
However, phytosteroids are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, certain cancers).
The known sources of phytoestrogen are all legumes (the most popular is soybean), hmels, and seeds are lazy.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot replace natural hormones.
There can be no possible harm from such additions.
For example, in the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that too many of the equivalents are produced from outside.

I couldn't stay away!
I spent one and a half seasons in this club.
It wasn't the best time in terms of results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and its loyal fans, who have always been with the team!
I'll never forget the Munitepas stadium where I killed my 200th ball in my career!
"Gennis" must come back!
He's got a great story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the city will bring them back to their own club,' wrote the Veterans at Instagram.
The Basion complex launched the Ones rocket on Chukotka.
For the first time, the Ministry of Defence launched a winged rocket from the Basion compound in Chukotka.
Oikis started at a distance of 350 kilometres, and 200 of them flew over land, which is the record for this type of missile.

Hidrometre called the faithful people's renditions.
There are many popular acceptances in Russia where people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In Gydrometre, all the receptions that were supposed to be working were checked.
Meteorological scientists have concluded that only two can truly be trusted, yes, in a short time frame.
As the scientific leader of the Russian Hydrometre told us, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will truly be a catch, as our ancestors have noticed.
And if the sky were white, it would be raining the next day.
The second one is based on bird observation.
More often than not, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
This is simply explained by the fact that when the air humidity is heavy, the mosses are soaking their wings and feathers are forced to fall to hunt insects, write TASS.
There's a lot of people on different continents.
A harsh day is a traditional popular holiday in the United States and Canada, observed on 2 February every year.

Unidentified oil slicks have been detected on North-East Brazilian beaches
Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches of north-east Brazil.
Pollution has been scattered over 2,000 kilometres of the coast.
Reports of first detected oil stains began on September 2.
However, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all the same and they're all about crude oil.
In the State Petroleum Corporation of Petrobras, which was transferred to an analysis of the samples found, they stated that they did not represent oil derived from the deposits in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It may be dropped from one of the vessels after treatment of the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it was in the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1 of the oil union of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On beaches, four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country discovered nine sea turtles covered entirely by oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment will work with Petrobras to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute's experts recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil slicks and alert all sites of pollution that have been detected.

In addition, Mr. Medvedev commissioned all of the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for an experiment on the limitation of control activities for public health organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad province, effective 1 January 2020.
By 11 November, the Ministry and the Ministry were mandated to submit to the Government a bill amending the COAP on administrative suspension of activities for violation of the requirements for food, which had resulted in health damage.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economy, the Russian Federation and the Ministry need to work on a gradual transition from 2021 to the establishment of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that can produce a full diet of healthy food.
Remember, the old standards of business community requirements were discussed after a coffee shop from UnderSon was closed.
The business community had demanded the lifting of the existing SPINs, and Roswana Nadzor had announced the joint development of new ones.

There's no reason for the Russians to postpone retirement - V. Matvienko.
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to have a guaranteed pension product bill in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing personal savings pensions in the world is quite common.
It's another matter of how timely we have it.
“In my opinion, a large part of the population now has income, of which they have nothing to devote to future pension increases,” said V. Matvienko.
According to the Speaker, the mechanisms for the formation and assessment of the pension cannot be understood, since “continuous changes in this area have completely confused them”.
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we must do everything we can to ensure that pensions and citizens' social security improve.
But steps in this direction need to be thought-provoking, responsible, responsive to domestic realities,” said V. Matvienko “RIA News.
The Head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) was to be developed, several basic principles must be established, including voluntaryness, fiscal preferences for citizens and employers and strict safeguards and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September that a bill on a guaranteed pension product (PPP) would be sent for harmonization.
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary accession of citizens to the savings system, the guarantee of the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' accumulated accounts by the central administrator, business tax benefits and tax deductions for citizens.

It's amazing that Spaidy's journey to the crowned Marvel will continue.

In doing so, Faige recalled that Sony was creating his own royal, built right around the Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero to be in different hands.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Space Universe, the future may present unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram a piece of "Wolk with Wall Street" in which hero Leonardo de Caprio cries "I am not going!"
Information on the contradictions between companies was provided in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash proceeds from the Man-Man spider films, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of painting.
But it didn't suit Sony.
News of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from the crowned Marvel caused anger among many devoted worshipers.
The details of the new conditions are not yet shared.
As the CNBC reports, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have cooperated perfectly for the last four years, and our common desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many of the fans.
We are glad to be able to go forward together."
The "Mities: Final", which united the Spider-Man, Tora, Hulka and other superheroes Marvel, became the most cashier in the history of the world ' s film, moving from the first place, "Avatar."

Recall that Vladimir Pozzner, Mirey Mater (France), Alessandro Safina (Italy), Valeria, Soso Pavliasville, Igor Krutt, Zara, Tamara Guerdzati, Denis Clover, Valery Scutkin, Dimitry Malakov, Maxim Polidsky, Maxim Averski, Xenia Alferov, Nonna Grishaev, and others participated in the video.
Most of the participants publicly support the offensive policy of the Kremlin.
Winnik became the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
In the press service, the singer had previously explained that the artist had participated in a project in support of the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and his patriotic position had not changed.
Remember, there was a wave of resentment on the web.
The video itself is referred to as a ridiculer.
How did the artists who visited the occupied Crimea support Putin's policies, who waged war on Donbasa, where almost every day people die, talk about peace?
Four people convicted of a series of daisies in Khabarovska
In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Friendbá who had looted the Cosmos and Raduga partnerships for two years in the Black River area.
This is what IA Habarov Land reports on 27 September today.

Bears: CoCorin continues to train on an individual programme
Forvard of the Petersburg “Zenita” Alexander CoCorin continues his training on an individual programme after he has been released under the UDP, referring to the Director General of Alexander Medvedev's team.

The first MMA fights on the rules that Alexander Emelianenko made will take place in Moscow on 29 November, at the boxing end of Emellianenko and Strongman Mikhail Kokhlaev.
The fights were lost in sight, as I told Emelianenko in an interview with "SE."
Look at someone.
That's why I've come up with a new kind of mixed assembly, Universal World Night.
The rules are three different rounds.
MMA is a sport where all the martial arts are assembled.
A mixed-style side should be able to do everything -- to work hard, to fight, and to work in a party.
The first round is just a strike equipment in the counter.
The second round is only a struggle, with a limit of 30 seconds.
Round three is all allowed.
When will the first tour take place according to the rules you've come up with?
29 November.
The Undercard of our fight with Koklayev.
But so far, we don't know exactly how many fightings there will be.

The Russian-Indian trade could double because of the geopolitical situation.
This was reported by the Deputy Director of the Confederation of the Indian Industry, Manish Kumar, at the V anniversary of the small and medium-sized business forum of the SCO and BRISS regions.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia,” stressed a guest from Delhi.

All of this is a small and medium-sized business that cooperates with countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we're not standing here, but we're developing, and all of these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation are just helping us all grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds $10 billion, but these figures can be doubled.
It is primarily through new technologies in the areas of health care, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industries.

At the Trump Congress, they interviewed the Greens with a "Rusian trace"
In the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of being involved in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir of Green.
The assumption that this story might somehow be followed by “Russia” was expressed by the Speaker of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives and transmitted to MSNBC News.
“It seems that Russia has contributed”, the democracy declared, but did not make further comments.
The Pelos-headed democracies, who hold the majority in the House, had previously announced that an impeachment procedure had been initiated against the President.
This occurred after the intelligence officer complained about Trumpa.
He suspected that, in a conversation with the Greek in July, Trump had put pressure on his interlocutor for Ukraine to take action against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Bayden, and the latter could become a competitor of Trump in elections one year later.
The White House had to give the congressmen and the public a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

Exercising an oversight categorically against the return of hens to airports
Resumption is categorical against the return of hens to airports.
“Neither ventilation nor filters, even combined, can reduce the exposure of tobacco smoke to levels considered permissible”, is noted in the communication.
On Friday, the “Conference” reported that the Ministry had drafted amendments by second reading, which proposed that two smokers should be set up at the airport.
The expert explained why we should give up the tea in the bags.
A team of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that in five minutes more than ten billion particles of microplastics came into the cup when the tea bag was cooked.
In a packaged drink, particles of opium can also be added, said Nation News, food safety expert Elizabeth Tchinov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients there that will not be indicated on the package.
They don't throw at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"It doesn't always include tea plants in the bags," said Tikhova.
She said that it would be better to give up the use of such a drink in favour of a tea for sale at specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in the composition but also in the production method, microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could cause them to release harmful substances.
“The best way to buy clean green tea or black tea is to get the least of these drinks,” the expert said.

Regions have been invited to share business support secrets
As noted by the Parliament Gazette, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to Maxim Oreskin, Minister of Economic Development, and Minister of Finance, Anton Silvaanov, inviting him to express his position on initiatives by Federation entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy summarized information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes and the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions presented to the senators the problems of SME development and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional programmes for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole”, noted Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional efforts to legalize self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (proposed).
In addition to line ministries, summary data from the regions are also sent to the executive heads of the regional authorities.
The exchange of information on positive gains in the regions could lead to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to send information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the Senator’s “Parliamentary Gazette”.
Good experience
Support programmes for small and medium-sized businesses are now in place and are being successfully implemented in many regions of the country.
For example, the Volodovsk Region has a Business Support Centre which, in addition to financial support, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
A business support system has been developed in the Ivan region to implement the principle of one window through multi-functional centres.
In the Krasnodar province, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives receive grants from the regional budget.
The Orlovsk region has a cluster development centre.
The Amur region of the federal project “Acceleration of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established through existing non-State co-corporating centres from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have adopted special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be taken out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes in existing legislation should be made in order to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangelian Region proposed that the term “self-employment” should be replaced by “business”, since this “is most appropriate to the content of public services to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the province of Ivan, amendments are needed to expand the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities related to the separation and repair of accommodations, day-to-day constructions and physical training.
The British region believes that it is important to strengthen control over bad milk producers through the Mercure veterinary system.
In the Kostrom and Magadan regions, the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and social entrepreneurship support is promoted in the legal and regulatory field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, assured Andrey Kutep.
The airline helped passengers avoid contact with crying children
The Japanese Airlines (JAL) launched a new function: when booking seats on a plane, you can now find out where small children will be sitting.
Now, if you want to be close to them, you can avoid them.
The Japanese Airlines (JAL) passengers were able to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted contact with young children.
The carrier has set up a function to track where the children are sitting.
When choosing places in the cabin during booking, passengers will be able to see images of the child's head in the field of children between the ages of eight days and two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly by their babies because of the possible inconveniences associated with their crying may rest as far away from them as possible.
Internet users using airline services were excited about innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do likewise.
One character complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three crying children sitting next door with him.
Another commentator proposed the introduction of “ages for adults only”, expressing his willingness to pay for such travel.
Many tourists noted that they would now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they could see no pleasure in flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
In the past, a woman who traveled with her baby tried to pick up travellers during the Seoul San Francisco flight.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with an apology note.
The Oleg Tabakov train appeared on the capital subway?
If you always take advantage of the Calusian-Rizian line (and most of the residents of Konkova do so), you will be surprised.
A new thematic train called "The Great Russian Artist, Oleg Tabakov" was launched in the dungeon.
Every day, this particular composition transports 10,000 people.
He's just going through the orange line and he's talking about the director, the actor and the founder of the tobacco theater.
By the way, from Konkov it is convenient to go to performances that play on the new stage of the theater (which is located on the Little Sikh Square, near the Amo “Saurivsky”).
As the Moscow Metropolitan press service explained, “the design of the thematic train has drawn on the images of fragments of the new scene and has the portraits of Oleg Tabakov in symbolized images made by him in theater, movies and multimedia”.
The train tells of his family, the "Matrosian Silence" show, which began with a big life of theater, the "Tabakerke" itself, and the directorship.
You can see rare archive images and film footage on the walls of the wagons.

A same-sex Russian couple with two adopted children have sought asylum in the U.S., handing over RIA News.
The men reportedly left the Russian Federation for Ukraine and then went to the State where they applied for asylum.
According to the “Stimul” group, the basis for such actions by the family was “the continued interest of law enforcement agencies”.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the Moscow case.
Acter Pavel Ustinov joined the "Freedom for All" single picket series, which take place on Friday at the Russian President's office building on Old Square in Moscow, broadcasts Interfax correspondent.
A series of pickets began on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself and continues every day ever since.
At present, participants in change stand holding a poster in hand with the title “Freedom for All” and the names of those convicted and arrested after unconsented meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster the names of Imr Zhukova, Kirilla Zhukova, Daniel Beglec, Evgenia Kovalenko, Constantine Kotova, Ivan Podkopaev, Idar Gubaydulin, Alexei Miñailo, Sergueya Fomina, Samiddin Rajabova, Nikita Chirtsov, Edward Malishevsky and Vladislav Sinica.

Thereafter, on 20 September, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General, the Court changed the Constitution's measure of preventive detention to a non-departure measure.
For example, a petition for the release of Ustinov has taken more than 112,000 signatures per day.
The theater and film performers started a flashboard in support of a colleague.
In order to participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on 18 September, a turn was taken on Old Square.
Human rights defenders, journalists, scientists, teachers, doctors and Orthodox priests were required to review the case.
The Interfax sister of Ustina Julia reported that her brother was not planning to speak at a meeting on 29 September in the capital in support of the Moscow case.
The supply of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Government, the Russian Federation estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had dropped by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries, compared with 3 million 442,000 tons in the same period in 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million, from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
These include the supply of goods that were not subject to the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited imports was offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
We will recall that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food that are prohibited from entering Russia within the framework of counter-sanctions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the rules were extended for a further year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The original effect of the order to destroy sanctions was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein have joined the list, with effect from 1 January 2016, Ukraine.
Putin's decree on the illegal entry into the country of “sanctions” (food embargo products that Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of “sanctionary” food by any legal means.
As West sanctions continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, head of the President's Council for Civil Society Development and Human Rights, had previously called the “just immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, Russia has taken the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food fit for use in early June.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation.

The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its ever-great mirror, with a diameter of about 40 feet [39 m].
It will consist of 798 six-point segments of 1.4 m.
It's a huge mirror, and it's two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to search for Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observation to observe areas of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
