Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “go to the Maptes”
Among some members of the National Assembly, the offer of acceptance for their name of the U.S.
The problematic solution lies in plans to change the Assembly ' s name to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abrasion.
One Lebourist, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “remotes Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales, but from Wally twp means "bump", and pwp means "taste".
According to a member of the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “satisfied” and offered other options.
Conservative parties “no objection” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken approximately as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a name change law, made the following statement: “The final decision on how Assembly members will be named will of course remain behind”.
The Wales Management Act of 2017, the Wells National Assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion survey on the options proposed, according to which the “Parliament Wales” option instead of “The Assembly” was widely supported by the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee expressed its preference for the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP version received the greatest public support.
It seems that members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it is not easy for the presiding member, Elina Jones, to find a satisfactory solution for all.
Reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualifying of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the draft law.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country ' s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote for the country's name to be renamed “The Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province and has repeatedly opposed the accession of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to a change of name referendum, stated that he did not intend to accept its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that a change of country name is the only price of accession to the EU and NATO.
Harlem's crisis: St. Martin's bells remain silent forever.
“The regions with which I was associated were said to have been in each corner of the bar and in the church before, ” says Adams.
“Now there is no one else.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood as:
“The communication framework has changed”.
“Bar has ceased to be a sort of guesthouse for the entire area to which they regularly came.”
But in the case of churches, it is a matter of concern that the funds derived from the sale of assets will be short-lived, however much the leaders may have hoped for. “Either late or late, they will be left with nothing.”
At the site of the church, he added, there would be a multi-family building, whose tenants were unlikely to support the area ' s remaining arrivals.
“Most buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “This will bring about the day when such churches will finally close because new neighbours will never be their members.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area — Metropolitan Comunity in 1870 and St. Martin’s church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left their arrival in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black coming near.
When the Church of St. Martin came into the hands of the black community, she was led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a shopping boycott in 125th Street, the main trade artery of Garlem, where she refused to hire or raise black people.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by the fire and, during the reconstruction work, Johnson's father ordered the installation of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson's father, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin's church, proudly referred to carillion as “circuits for the poor”.
But the expert who tested the carillion in July called it otherwise: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the carillon of St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of a kind to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. He was invited 18 years ago to play a larger carillion in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriezer, St. Martin's church still hasn't been replaced by him.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s church has had a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal Church.
The congregation of members, a ruling body of secular leaders, turned to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of work” to the congregation, although the latter had no connection with the election of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members expressed their dissatisfaction at the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, the shark was injured by a 13-year-old diver who was involved in hunting lobsters.
Official sources report that on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel explained in an interview with the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with his friends and heard the boy's cries for help about half an hour later, and together with his friends, they set out on a boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the young man out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first decided that the boy was very excited about the lobster's capture, but quickly "Knowed that he was shouting, "I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
He approached the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had completely torn his skin around his head”.
“I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: ‘Here is a shark!’ ” Hammel relates.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Radio Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark attacked by a teenager is unknown.
The Saviour, Captain Larry Giles, reported in a press briefing that a shark had been seen several weeks ago but had not been classified as dangerous species.
He added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the zone from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
He observed that there were 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to conquer the British Parfum-Cosmetic Market
Sainsbury is going to install space and perfume units in Butes, Superdrog and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists, according to the Luxembourg department store model.
The British Parfy-Cosmetic Market is estimated to be £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the field of fashion and goods for sale at home, a significant share of the desirable market is expected to be captured as an experiment in 11 shops throughout the country, and many other stores should be expected to succeed in the next year.
The owners of supermarkets are looking for more than filling shelves previously set aside for television, microwave furnaces, home goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market is a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the number of cosmetics to 3,000; for the first time, stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, at designated locations, by type of organization of goods at Butes shops.
In addition, a market line for products called Boutik Cosmetics will be reorganized to meet the needs of young buyers.
The two shops of Sainsbury will be represented by a troupes of Fragrance Sop, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Celly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small amount of food per day in small benches near home have led supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Sainsbury, says that the athletes will gradually turn into a department store, and his supermarket network fights for buyers to compete against cheap shops, such as Aldy and Lidle, offering more services and non-food goods.
There are hundreds of Sainsbury supermarkets where Argos athletes are located, and some can now find Habitats stores since the network purchased both stamps two years ago, which has led to increased sales of food products and proceeds from these purchases.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetic and pharmacist divisions failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized between Sainsbury and Butes, but further differences arose between the participants regarding the distribution of income from the sale of pharmaceuticals at supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsbury pharmaceutical business (only 281 shops) by Celecio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmasi' network, within £125 million three years.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide line of luxuries for the skin of La Roche-Pasay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our Parfümerie and Cosmetic divisions to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to assist the board.
Our brand range for any taste, pleasant design, and comfortable shopping will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumers, which will be a whole new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones “suddenly” responded to Holly Willowby's withdrawal from the contract by £11 million
Peter Jones, who came out of the Dragon's Fire Show, was angry with Holly Willowby's broadcast from a £11 million deal she was supposed to enter into with Peter's Leifstable, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of household clothes and excisors Truly.
This couple's business was compared to Goop actress Gwynette Peltrow.
The 37-year-old lead programme, "This morning", announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profitable Leifstable-brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to the rage of Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon Fire.
According to our sources, Jones was “flashed ” when a television lover at a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that she would not have enough time after the conclusion of new contracts at a cost of up to 1.5 million for their common brand of household clothes and exams Truly.
Their stamp was compared to that of the actress Gwyneth Peltrow, who was expected to double Willowabi's worth of £11 million.
A 37-year-old leader announced her departure in Instagram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree living for the next couple of decades.
Its decision led to the step of all parties to the transaction.
Everyone was amazed at what had happened on Tuesday, for weeks had been left before the stamp was launched.
At Marlow headquarters, there was a full warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of one of Britain's most popular stars, the leading “This morning”, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in launching the line.
It is also the breakup of long-standing friendships.
Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for 10 years.
Willowby set up a Truly mark with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company's board in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and Jones also owns 40 per cent of Dan Baldwin's share of television.
Willowby will be the Ambassador of M&S and will replace Anthony McCapartlin as the leader of ITV's "I'm Famous."
The source of Johns' close neighborhood said last night: “We cannot comment on his business cases”.
Complex negotiations, “and then we fell in love with each other”
He was joking about the criticism he had received from the media because of the “indecent President” comment and the positive appreciation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up such claims?
Says Trump, imitating the voice of the lead news.
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim Chen Eun was interested in a re-meeting, after Trump had called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a dead end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-level North Korean diplomat Lee Young Hoe made a statement to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was still “responsibly responding” from the United States following initial measures by the DPRK on disarmament.
Instead, the United States, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as a tool of pressure.
During the meeting of its supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“Nor Korea has a great deal to do, ” he said. “
“We were on the verge of the North Korean War.
Millions could have died.
And now we have an excellent relationship."
According to Tramp, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong Eun bore fruit: missile tests were stopped, hostages were released, and American troops remaining in DPRK also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Chen Yun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“To be a fit for President is so simple, but then instead of the 10,000 people on the street who are breaking into this entire hall, there would be only 200 people here”, said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
The tsunamis and the earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, victims are estimated to be hundreds of
In the early days of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that there was no need for their assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost its roof, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that there is no need for international support, so it has been difficult,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team for departure to Palau, but we do not yet know whether a foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of Indonesia ' s continued seismic instability, the country remained terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coasts.
Despite warnings of the tsunami threat, siren was not included in Palau to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously moored in Lombok to help victims of the earthquake is headed to Palau, but the road to the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s infrastructure a central point in his electoral campaign and has spent invaluable resources on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko ' s administration, which was running for a new term next year, had been confused by funding problems.
The President is also criticized for exacerbating interfaith hatred between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands more have been left homeless as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other self-arrows.

A monument to Cromwell in front of the Parliamentary building caused a bitter debate on “history re-writing”
Cromwell's exile would have been a well-deserved retribution for the barbarous destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts by its followers, by Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell's Society of Memory referred to Mr. Crick's proposal as “a fascination” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmite, president of the Cromwell Memory Society, stated: “In the ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived before him.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft, reflects the view of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldmite said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case from monarchy.
Whether such an opinion is historically accurate remains a subject of debate by experts.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that emerged in the mid-17th century has affected our country ' s subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as the Protector Lord are also to be commended and respected.”
A Chinese farmer killed a killer pig
In a market in south-west China, a farmer was a victim of pigs, reporting to local media.
The victim's bloody body (only his name is mentioned in the media) was found in a torn artery near the market in Lupanshui district of Guizhou Province in southern China, as reported in the Morning Post on Sunday.
Porcelain vaccinations are being prepared by the Lead Guide on 30 May 2005, Shinin County in Qinhai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin came from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and imported 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin found a smokeless body of Yuang, and the door to a neighboring pigfish was opened.
There was a lot of blood in the pighole.
A forensic examination found that the pig weighed 250 kilograms [250 kg] to death.
“My brother’s feet were bloodthirsty and distorted, ” said the Guyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The video from the surveillance cameras showed that Joan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed her animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been isolated during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yianja family is negotiating compensation for the farmer ' s death with the market administration.
It is not common for pigs to be attacked by humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., causing serious injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal drove a Welsh peasant to the tractor and released only after being frightened by a wife who had been trained.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, according to the CBC News Channel, a Canadian farmer, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “launch mechanism”.
“The pigs of the games,
They are bitten and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just have to instill in your animal a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring torrents to a large part of the United States south-west
It is projected that Hurricane Rosa is losing strength by moving through a more cool water zone on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the next few days, it will bring rains and floods to northern Mexico and south-west United States territory.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached the 1st category, with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 kilometres south-west of Punta Euchnia, Mexico.
A hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low pressure zone, which will be moving east to the western coast of the United States, near the coast of Baja California, and will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected on Monday in Mexico.
Tropical humidity in the emerging low pressure zone is causing heavy rains in the south-west in the coming days.
Rainfalls from 2.5 to 10 cm would cause dangerous rain floods, muddy streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona, high tropical air humidity can cause rainfall rates to reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the south-west United States, most of the territory of Arizona is expected to fall to between 5 and 10 centimetres.
The risk of sudden, rapidly developing floods is not excluded, owing to the uneven distribution of tropical rain.
At the risk of tropical rainfall, walking in the desert can have serious consequences.
Lions can turn canons into brown rivers, and thunder can cause high winds and dust clouds to rise.
The low pressure zone will be hit by torrential rains on the coast of southern California.
A drop of up to 1.5 centimetres, which can cause small, muddy streams and create slippery road surfaces.
These are the first rains since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, in Arizona, tropical rains will be over, spreading throughout the territories by Monday and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the downpour will be over in the four corners and will last until Wednesday night.
In October, the United States will experience a sharp rise in temperature, due to the low temperature in the Arctic at high enough temperatures in the tropics.
At times, this combination results in severe temperature declines in a small area.
Such sharp temperature swings will be particularly evident in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most central and eastern United States territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures reaching up to 27 degrees above the southern plains to the north-east of the country.
In New York, air temperatures can rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above average, on Tuesday.
Our long-term forecast of weather promises an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing in Judge Bretta Kavano's case saw more than 20 million viewers
Britta Cavanano and Christine Blazi Ford, who accuses Kavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political confrontation around the claim of Kavano was followed up by an emergency message in the media on Friday: Republican Jeff Flake made it a condition that charges against a lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Legal Committee hearings, she was “100 per cent” confident that Kavano was intoxicated and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavano gave emotional testimony, saying that he was 100% sure that it wasn't.
According to the research agency Nielsen, Friday debates were attended by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average statistical data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
Moreover, Nielsen ratings do not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
In comparison, it is an average audience who follows the American football game in pleife or an Oscar service ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Kavano: the Senate hearings lasted for an average of 5.69 million viewers a day, reported to Nielsen.
In second place, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was looking at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the case has not diminished.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After the senator from Arisona, considered to be a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support the candidature of Kavano, CNN and CBS managed to seal on the camera as Flake met an elevator on Friday morning on the way to the meeting of the Legal Committee with a group of activists who had criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him, with his eyes down, receive a flash call from angry women live on CNN.
"I am standing before you," said one of them.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“The power behind you, while so many women are powerless,” tried to explain her position.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator door closed while hiding the senator from the surrounding chambers.
When, a few hours later, the Legal Committee was ready to approve Kavano's candidature for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast live.
Flake, however, made one condition: that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority was seeking.
Flake claims to have changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, a senator from the democracies of Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to claim Kavano without conducting an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses his critics of “political games” around the Brexite situation
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting a narrow interest ahead of society.
The British Prime Minister attends a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on one line with the interview of May, the former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Brackita Plan, stating that he considered the introduction of customs duties between the United Kingdom and the EU to be “absolutely ridiculous”.

The volcano covered Mehiko's ashes
Popocatepetl volcano fell asleep in the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: it had registered activity and had produced 183 paragas emissions per day.
According to the Centre’s observations, there was frequent swelling and trembling near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochemilco, social media users have published photographs of frontal glass of cars covered with thin ash.
Following an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which rocked central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded an increased volcanic activity of 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
Popocatepetl volcano (or, for its own sake, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Clashes of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, Barcelona held a multi-month meeting to celebrate the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps; there were no clashes between supporters of autonomy and police; six rioters were detained.
Police officers pushed protestors of independence away, while the latter, covered in black masks, threw eggs and powdery paint into custody, raising dark dust clouds in the heart of Barcelona.
The riots resumed with renewed force after the police left the baton to deter the crowd.
For a few hours, independence supporters complained, "We won't forget, we won't forget", and their opponents answered with a slogan, "Long live Spain!".
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were admitted to the hospital with light injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists, one year later in a region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia had voted for withdrawal from Spain with great weight, but the appearance was low owing to the fact that opposition to the exit had predominantly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year, almost 1,000 people were injured when police tried to block the referendum in the country ' s polling stations.
On Friday, separatists were sleeping on the declared road following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it went on a different route.
A 68-year-old electrician named Narcissus Termes, who visited a separatist meeting with his wife's company, is saying that the hope of Catholic sovereignty is becoming increasingly difficult.
“This past year has seen one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying out of happiness for an opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a hanged state,” he said.
In the recent December elections to local government, the Catalan parties in favour of separation from Spain had won an important victory, albeit with a slight withdrawal, but this year their movement is losing its supporters because many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either in flight or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hong Puch, a 42-year-old mechanics who recorded a police support meeting on the phone, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is rising, ” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament the following year.
“Participation in the regular elections of the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish Government”, he said.
Londoners: The car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One house in London was hit several times by a car; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The attack took place on Thursday at 7:30 local time in the Ballinard Krecent area.
As a result, the gates and the building were damaged and the police inspector Bob Blammings informed the building itself.
There are reports that a bow shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Ranger's thanks to the Menga mark
Dolly Mengi's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to the Liwingston team
Livingston won an unexpected victory over the Rangers.
Dolly Mengi's exact impact compared Harry Holt's team to the Hibernian club in a credit table where they divide second place.
The Gerard's Club was not won during this season's Premier League, and on Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, Harts, who are eight points behind Rangers.
On Thursday, Rangers will host the League of Europe match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna) on its field.
Livingston Club has continued its win-win series in the division, playing six matches and not having any injuries since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as team coach.
Missing moments for Livingston in a match with Nascent guests
Trusted coach Holt was supposed to keep an account from the outset, and the Rangers clearly failed to deal with them.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the defense line, but the naked one of his weak attempts didn't work out, and then the lawyer, Alan Litgo, swing too wide, couldn't stop Cage Hulkett from getting on the net.
The receiving party allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, counting on the dangerous moments at the resumption of the game.
That's how they missed that important goal.
The Rangers gave up a free strike, and Livingston took this opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who had beaten him from his central position.
By then, Rangers had a superior possession of the ball, but the protection of the host team was untried, so Liam Kelly's fan was not concerned.
The second time continued according to the same pattern, although Kelly still had to strike off Alfredo Morelos.
The Ranger's fan, Allan McGregor, kicked off Scott Pittman's ball, and Little made a big pitch out of the standard position.
Their bodies were constantly placed in the Livingston fine, but all of the attacks were reflected, and two of the Panel's demands — one for triggering Glenn Middleton Hallett's spare player and the other for his hand — were not met.
Livingston Fonomental Game - Analysis
From BBC Scottland - Alder Lamont, report from The Tony Macaroni Arena
The nominal game and the excellent result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great, and once again they exceeded all expectations, continuing their rise to the football Olympics.
Their game style and composition have not changed much since they got back to the top of the rating, and coach Holt's great merit is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halket led a greatly organized defense, and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
However, Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
Although they had good game moments with coach Gerard, this time they failed to meet our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they lacked access to the ball, and only once did they manage to protect the host team. The Rangers, who came down to the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Erdogan cool reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was a fine weather, and both of them were in a good mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan ' s visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO participating countries — the visit — and already associated with some conflicts.
Heads of State were unable to find an understanding of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend a ceremony to open a huge new mosque.
In Cologne, there is the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25 thousand-thousand mob to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters stood nearby to see their president.
Opposers of the Erdogan regime, including Kurds, also gathered in the same location to condemn fully both Erdogan policy and the German Government ' s decision to invite him to Germany.
The radical opposite views of the meeting reflect the mixed nature of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots pride Erdogan, while others consider it a tyrant.
Deptford road crash: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car met a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a lively intersection in the south-eastern part of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The car driver and the ambulances who arrived were trying to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometres from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London police report that work is under way to identify the deceased and notify his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads are closed at the scene and the bus route is changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Disturbing at Long Laartin Prison: Six police officers injured
According to the Long Laartin Administration, six police officers were injured in riots at a male high-security prison.
The Man ' s Long Laartin High Prison (Wustershire) has continued to experience riots since Sunday about 09:30 local time.
To suppress the disturbances involving eight prisoners from the same wing, the “Tornado” operational group was summoned.
The police were slightly damaged by the soft tissue of the person; they were treated locally.
According to the prison official, “specially trained staff members have been recruited to resolve the incident at Long Laartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for a longer term.”
Over 500 prisoners are currently held in Long Laartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported in the media that the prison manager had been admitted to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the prison authorities were forced to involve special-purpose units to calm down the scattered prisoners who had thrown billiard balls at the wards.
Hurricane Rosa can sink the Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit drylands)
Arizona rarely enters an intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it has been “happily”: at the beginning of the next week, Hurricane Rosa, with his last blast, must pass over the deserted part of South-West and lead to the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flood floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in towns such as Feniks, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will take place on a straight line over the Phoenix on Tuesday and will pour out on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Feniks reported on Twitter that “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression since 1950, at 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arisona border.”
Recent projections of the National Meteorological Service suggest that between 5 and 10 centimetres will fall, reaching 15 centimetres on the Maholon-Rome Arison Plateau.
In other desert regions of the south-west, such as central rock mountains and Grand Bassein, possibly falling to 2.5 to 5 cm, rainfall may reach 10 cm.
The rain caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing to the regions that torrent valleys will bypass, for the region has long suffered from drought.
While rainfall may pose a danger, abundant rains can facilitate a dry season that does not take place in the south-west of the United States.
According to U.S. Drawht Monitor maps, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory is affected by at least a severe drought (the second most severe category), ” reports the website.
First, Hurricane Rosa will impact the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane, with a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 kilometres south of Punta Euchanya, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane found himself in a more cooler zone on the Pacific coast, thus losing power.
In the afternoon, the storm will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some parts of Mexico, it is expected that heavy rains will occur with the threat of floods.
“The territory from Lower California to Northwest of Sonora may fall to between 7 and 10 cm in rainfall and up to 25 cm in places,” reports the website.
Then Hurricane Rosa will march north through Mexico and reach the border with Arizona on Tuesday morning in the category of tropical cyclone, from Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main potential risk posed by Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the heavy rains in Lower California, north-west Sonora and desert parts of south-west USA,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
It is expected that rainfall will cause dangerous rainfall floods, muddy streams in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four suspects were detained for attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and suspected of attempted murder by three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy.
The victim of a serious injury attack was found in the Exacér Terras area of the town of Midsomer Norton about 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “sustainable”.
On the same evening, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstok area, reporting to Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to crime with any video on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "The Kavano "has been subjected to all the hatred, all the ills of the democracies."
“The voice behind Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and gruesome tactics of the democracies,” said Trump at a meeting of his associates in Wilinga, West Virginia.
In Trumpa's view, in the process of approving Kavano's Nomination, the candidate “has been subjected to all hatred, all the anger” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavano testified to the U.S. Congress by categorically rejecting Christine Blazi Ford's allegations that he had sexually molested her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage of” Cavanao.
“The voice for the approval of Judge Kavano is a voice for the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unfettered record of public service”, announced President Tope of his associates in West Virginia State.
In his speech, the President indirectly addressed the issue of Kavano ' s reappointment, referring to the importance of the arrival of Republicans for the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives are only five weeks.
I don’t take part in them, but I’m in the race in another way, ” he said.
“I am wearing myself as a coal and am fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the democracies have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all our strength”.
In accordance with the rules, the first key vote in the Senate, on the approval of the Kavano candidate, should take place no later than Friday, and the Assistant High-level Representative of the Republican Party spoke.
The Indonesia earthquake claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died; many had been swept away by giant waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by the incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palau, and on Friday, on the coast of the coast, there were waves nearly six metres high, which swept them all along and led to the instantaneous death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When yesterday was announced a storm warning, people continued their beach rest instead of immediately running into hiding, and thus lost their lives,” reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis did not come alone; there were cars, log houses, entire houses; the elements destroyed everything on their way, ” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and had hit the coast with full force.
Some of those present left for the trees, saving their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
Aeronautics of disaster management have seen destroyed houses, shops, destroyed bridges and flooded mosques.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground pushes.
A series of earthquakes occurred on a territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) stated that the earthquake-induced energy emissions were about 200 times greater than the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been more severe than expected through the geographic location of a city located at the end of a long, narrow Gulf.
Nugrojo described the damage as “scaled”, adding that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the destroyed buildings; 540 were injured, and 29 others were missing.
Nugrojo added that the casualties and destruction could be even larger along the coast as far as 300 kilometres from Palau, at Dungala, which was closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
Communications with Dungal were “completely destroyed, no information was received”.
“More than 300,000 people live in the Dungal region”, reports in its communiqué the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but this is not the limit,” the communication says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report the tsunami in Palau on time; however, the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
A loving video appeared on social media where a man on the upper floor of the building shouts about the approaching tsunami, desperately trying to attract people's attention on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water breaks onto the beach, carrying all the houses and cars.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami have resulted in a major depletion of electricity, which has caused communication in Palau, making it very difficult for services to escape.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuees still lack food and basic necessities, and Government sources report.
The airport was opened for humanitarian assistance only; it will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palau.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came safely from Dungala to Palau, where staff found a shelter in tarpaulin tents in their office building yard.
"They have seen a great many houses destroyed," he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charity organizations have begun to operationalize humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NGOs have not been able to reach Palau.
Indonesian legislation permits funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after a disaster site has been declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster”, reports Aulia Aryani, Spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but for the time being, the status remains unchanged.”
The second day after a natural disaster struck Paul, friends and relatives of the people who were missing still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will restore the people to their faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewer was saved.
On Sunday the rescuers took out from the debris of the building a woman who had spent two days there, next to her mother's unsuffered body.
Hendon Subandono, coach of National Paraplanerism Indonesia, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped in the Roa Room were his disciples, including Mandagi.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Hendon recalls that when he learned of the crash at Roy Roa's hotel from other paraplaners, he was desperate to contact his colleagues at a beach festival at Cia App.
However, his messages were reflected with one gray dot, not two blues.
“This means that no communications have been delivered”, he considers.

On Friday morning, vibes stole $26,750 from the Brink's camerakeeper, who runs one of the Newport-on-Livi ATMs, in a press release from the Newport Police.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was about to fill it with new notes.
At that time, "Brink's staff member ran up from his back" and stole a bag of bank notes to fill up an ATM.

Citizens with any information on these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at No. 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Repper changed the name to Yee
Repper Kanye West came up with a new name: Yee.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: “The personality formerly known as Kanje West”.
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time, even putting it in the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news of this appeared in advance of Kanya's arrival in the Southern Night Live transmission, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanje West will act as co-convenor instead of Ariana's singer, who cancelled her participation because of “emotional concerns”, the author of the broadcast.
The West stated earlier that it was not only a reduced version of his name but also a religious one.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means "you," "you," so West explained the title of his album in one of the recent interviews with the broadcaster Big Boy.
"I am you, I am us.
First it was Kane, which means "only," and now I'm just Y, that is, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible things in us, just right away.
And an album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Canier's not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deady, Pi Diddy, or just Diddy, asked this year to name himself Love (Love) or Brasa Love (Brat Love or Brother Love).
Speaking with Westper J-Z, he also changed his name several times: defys and no capital letters or building letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against the civilian population
The President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, vowed never to use military force against civilians in the lead-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended in a bloody confrontation.
On Saturday, on the Square of Tlatelolco, President López Obrador promised “never to seek the assistance of an army to oppress the Mexican people”.
At this site, on October 2, 1968, the first crowd shots were fired during a peaceful demonstration, and the massacre began, killing 300 people, against the backdrop of an increase in left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also promised support to Mexican young people through a monthly scholarship and the opening of more free State universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for learning have led young people directly into a criminal world.
US$ needs to double the financing of IA ' s development
China and its artificial intelligence (III) efforts should not be underestimated — the United States should double its investment in its scientific developments, according to Lee Kaif, investor and entrepreneur in the development of IP with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries have previously made statements on the II work, although the US as a whole does not have a clear strategy for the development of the II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan as early as last year: its goal is to become the first innovation of II by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for the II research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are awaiting the next breakthrough in the II area,” says Lee.
The increase in funding could double the chances that the next major achievement of the II would be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hogghton Mifflin Harourt, is the Director General of Sinoventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent I.I.M. companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Melon, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that exceeded the highest player in American Otello and was then a leader at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Robotics Challenge Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee is convinced.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university lights in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think Greencards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published a plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the next generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to scientists in the same way that the National Scientific Foundation and other governmental organizations contribute money to United States researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with partners from industry and academia involved, and the White House announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DarPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in II research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which had sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, had not taken any action in that regard for several months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour ' s name is a claim in its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a new name, but opponents nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the people of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would be 50 per cent as necessary for the referendum.
The question put forward at the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for membership of organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they may live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” relates a 79-year-old Oliver Georgievsky, resident of Skopje.
The sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although not legally binding.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority vote of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1,300.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe”, says 62-year-old Yosa Tanevski, an elector from the capital city of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Doszko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for her to join NATO and the European Union in Stromica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje Vladimir Kavardarkov, age 54, a small scene was prepared, placing chairs in front of tents installed by those citizens who intend to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and EU membership, but we want to combine with a high-level head rather than double the thresholds of the official cabinets,” says Kawadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment in Macedonia, which was so much needed by that country, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO”, said Zaire after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a guarantee of our secure future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV Canal found that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this amount claims to vote positively.
In order for a referendum to take place, it must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major attack on the policy of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Serhio Aguéro of Manchester City bypasses Bryton's defense to kill the goal.
Sergio Aguéro and Rahim Sturling were killed in the defense of Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory with account 2:0 on Saturday at Tsehad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit his goal at 65 minutes, it seemed he had no difficulty.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass at the center of the field.
He was running between three Bryton's attorneys before he broke open.
Aguerao found herself surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He went around one of the attorneys and drove several more along the edge of the Briton fine zone.
Then he handed the Stern ball to the left.
An English attacker in a fine zone returned one by one the Aguero ball, which right leg hit Matthew Ryan's brother-in-law, Matthew Ryan, at the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problem with his feet,” told the reporters, coach Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit a needle at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blue an initial advantage in the fight against the Prime League.
That goal was scored at 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero got a ball, deep inside Briton.
He gave a great cut to the left flank on Leroy San.
Sana made a few points before she passed the Sterling over to the far-off pants.
The attacker, Heavenly Blue, hit the ball at the gate right before flying outside the field.
Manchester City fought with Hoffenham on Tuesday, at 12:55 on the Rhine Neckcar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to pick points from Colorado Roquis.
After Washington Nashionals emerged from the Battle for Play-Off, there was no particular reason to force events.
But insatiable Sherser hopes to take the lead in the fight against Colorado Rokis on Sunday, but only if Roquez has problems ahead of Los Angeles Dougers in the West Division, will there be problems in the play-off.
On Friday evening, at least 7 or 8 seats were won over the Nashionals, but they still hope to secure title in the first division.
“And while we play just like this, at least we can maintain our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of spectators and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?’
Nashionals has not yet announced a Friday on Sunday, but, according to recent data, sheerzer is likely to play this role.
Sherzer, who's about to go out for the 34th game, was throwing a ball at the petriller's site on Thursday, and on Sunday, Sunday, he's gonna be a petrator.
The statistics for the right-wing player, Washington, D.C., are 18-7 and are rated as ERA 2.53 and 300 Auts at 220 2/3 Ingestings in the current season.
Tramp holds a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the arrival of Republicans in the interim elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation concerning Bretta Kavano, a candidate nominated by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I do not run, although I do run, fighting everywhere for good candidates, ” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using whatever means are necessary, and we are witnessing palatableness and disgustingness.
They don't care who they're hurting who they have to cross to get power and control, which is what they want to get -- power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
The democracies, he claims, were intended to “oppose and obstruct”.
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said, referring to the democracies as “wicked, mean, devious and lying”.
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee by referring to Senator Senator Diane Fainsstein, which caused loud calls from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow this document to leak?
Mmm... um... what kind of document?
No, no, the body's language has given it away, and I've never seen the body's tongue so disprove words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization of differing views.
It's not tolerant of those who say it.
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament for the Labour Party who has not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe are irony issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time, of my eight years as a local parliamentary member of the Labour Party, the GC evening Friday meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone is inconsistent with those many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there is no difference of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming increasingly clear, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and positions that I would never agree with — whether they were questions of national security or of a single EU market.
Every time I make a public statement — and no matter what I say — the social media have been hit by insults calling for the abolition of elections condemning the centre's policy or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments addressed to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who daily face an attack on sexual or racist grounds but never give up.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that this number of insults has become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with every confidence in or change in the rules of choice, the party is already becoming a party.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations encouraging me to sit quietly and shut up, and then I will be all right.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the labourers 32 years ago, as a school student who was outraged by the Government ' s contemptuous attitude on the part of Thetcher, which literally caused my school class to break up, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — whether the work of a local deputy or government minister.
I never kept my political views hidden, and I didn't do it in the last election.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
I would like to say to those who supported this podium on Friday: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which is guaranteed economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are Labourers or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the abolition of election results or political expediency will prevent me from doing what I think is necessary in your interest.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham District East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air
Two late attempts may have distorted the final outcome, but no doubt Air deserved a triumph in this amazingly interesting Tennent Prime League match.
They now lead the table, the only unconquerable team of tens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the right to be content.
“We have been tested for strength all this time, and we are still unconvincing, so I have no reason to be sad, ” commented Peter Merchi.
Robin Christy, Melrose: “Er is worth it, they've done better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Climo led the Air forward, but the yellow card released for "Voriors" by Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed him to move forward, while Jason Baggot took hold of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the "Er" cut from the fine before, right in the middle of the game, he earned a point, and then in a break, he made a single attempt to make an account 17-5 in favour of "Er".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who had suffered an extension, and after a second withdrawal, Air moved on owing to Stafford McDauel's attempt by Climo.
The Acting Captain Blair McFurson then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a period of violent pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the Climo interception without a ball with a line of fines, McFurson made a tachdown behind the incoming Mol Air.
The Climo realized the advantage without stopping almost once again, after Kyle Row had received a blow from David Armstrong and had sent the most extreme attacker Gregor Henry on his fifth attempt to control the field.
From there, Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business.
From there, Still Game Ford Kieran is going to start working in the hotel industry: he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor serves as Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that he writes to, and he's filming with Greg Hemfield's old comedy partner.
Dueth announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and Kirnan seems to be planning his life after Craigng.
According to official information, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
Acter refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to take part in a “blossom restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“The world is our”: the landlocked Bolivia hopes that the Court will once again open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have blue flags.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked by a slogan: "Our world is right.
To return it is our duty.”
The entire land-locked Bolivia is still living in memory of the coastal line lost in Chile as a result of the 19th century ' s bloody conflict because of resources; and the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia looks forward to an international court decision to be held on 1 October following five years of debate.
“For Bolivia, there is energy, a spirit of unity and balance of mind, and certainly there is a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s claim that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign land to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous people of Bolivia, who is waging a difficult battle for re-election next year, also looks forward to the decision to be delivered on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean”, he claimed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, this will not change much.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already stated that it will have no influence on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case “was not difficult”, says Pas Zarat, a Chilean expert on international law.
The Bolivia case has not moved forward for the past four years, and vice versa has been delayed.
“The foreign administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes”, says Zarata.
She said that Morales’ military rhetoric had destroyed the last Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but discussions will then be extremely difficult.
These two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Welce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court's decision was delivered too quickly.
The Monday will provide Bolivia with “an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of mutual benefit differences”, he claims.
Calzazadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, uses the naval problem as a political vis-à-vis itself.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to see once again that we need to move through our past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not continue until it can trust the United States
Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho of North Korea states that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments are received as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of relaunching the impasse in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yong in Singapore.
Ri claims that it is a dream that the United States' prolonged sanctions and its objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever put the North on its knees are Utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Phenian has taken significant steps to disarm itself.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the renunciation of an arsenal that the country probably views as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows the latest line of massive head coverings that are promised to appear on the mass sale, and they will be carried right next to you.
If you want to add hats to your collection or protect yourself completely from sunlight, you don't need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented a mass of unusual head brushes, part of their SS19 collection and blinding visitors to the Fashion Week in Paris.
Instagram subscribers became popular in this summer, and designers decided to send their snowscrapers to the podium.
An outstanding copy of Valentino, the main beige cleaning, decorated with broad fields similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of the models.
Other massive assemblies included jeweled watermelons, a magician’s hat, and even pineapple, but all these head coverings were not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these sandy masks had their mouth covered, and they were more like Hannibal Lektor's portrait than a turret painting.
One of the copies resembled underwater navigation equipment with tubes and protective glasses, and the other was a melting ice cream.
If you're a high fashion fan, you're lucky.
Dynamic critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of getting into mass sales — right to you.
The huge hats are on the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot wide fields, which everyone has been wearing, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cartoon, which released this extremely impractical hat that won so much popularity in social media, gave birth and sent another huge ass on the podium — a strawed beach bag, almost as large as the one that wore the model bearing the bag.
The orange bag of a roasted raffle with a white leather handle and a Rafia border was a bright copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
“I think big hats and beach bags will appear on the public market for the next summer, and since the designer produced such furor with his products, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge asses.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
The Scottish Independent Schools continue their tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations demonstrated individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other public and relevant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, seeking to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their chosen career and the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, you are calling to his understanding.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, then you turn to his heart.’
This is a convincing indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to have relations with citizens of other countries and have the ability to trust them.
As a result of recent examinations this year, languages have taken the lead in League tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest “A”.
The data received for 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (not Chinese), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are now in the same demand as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for the difficulties faced by employers in filling vacant jobs were linguistic skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession he chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future by learning another additional skill that he can use for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey of YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adult British people participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage — spoken by 15 per cent of respondents.
That's why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, would give children a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland schools there is a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in those languages.
Scottish independent schools seek to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in the future development of the country in the global business environment, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, ensuring diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron debuts Lakes Sunday in San Diego
The ambitious expectation of fans to see LeBron James speak for the first time in Los Angeles Lakeers is almost over.
Lakes coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a pre-seated Sunday match against Dever Naggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how much time he's gonna have to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight”, replied Walton on the official Leykers website.
Lakeers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited time.
Following the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six front-end games on Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-separate games to prepare for the season, ” answers the player.
Trump's pre-election race in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-election meetings this evening in Wilinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a friendly visit by Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the candidate he proposed for the post of Chief Justice was postponed, Trump sought support in the upcoming interim elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote were to take place in November.
How long is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wilinga, West Virginia, will be held today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting with Western Virginia voters online on live YouTube.
Trump will probably speak at this week ' s hearings to nominate Bretta Kavano as Chief Justice, and the proposal by Trump of this candidate has caused a large number of negative reactions, as Kavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken at the Senate will be postponed until the week before the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this action is to help the Republicans who go out to the November elections to build up a pre-election pace.
Thus, President Trump's campaign is aimed at helping “enact the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives”, writes Reuters.
“The Congress is so important to its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, since we are entering a tense election campaign season,” says Trump’s pre-election secretary, who refused to be called, reports Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga can attract supporters from "Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburg media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
A visit to Tramp of Western Virginia on this Saturday is the second visit to the state during the last month, which was where he gained the advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is behind the polls.
“The fact that the president must come to see Morrisi’s competitors is not a good sign for Morris himself, ” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. assembly shows a willingness to fight and gives hope by going on Sunday for a pair of contests
After three unilateral sessions, a Saturday game of two to two may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
A transition initiative is an exceptional fictional sports concept, but it is in which players believe, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had an advantage of six points, and now four, so I think this is a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Sleeping.
Of course, Europe has four points, and another twelve on the horse.
According to Spit, Americans feel "the wind in sails," and they have reasons to keep their spirits high, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleep was constant from you to the grind, rather than setting a personal example.
The victory calls became ever more loud as his round continued, slamming the crucial ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas stepped down two by two.
His blow, which caused him to win the game on the 15th hole, was met by a similar call, one of those who talk about his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with our best efforts and focus only on our own game”, commented Sleep.
That's all the players left.
You go through 18 holes and you're gonna win.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Sleep and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have clearly entered the story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they seem to know no mistakes.
Molewood was the only couple who did not gain a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series, and how their energy seems to circulate between them and wild fans, strengthens faith in the fact that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun closes behind the horizon of the field Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player who has built up a potential victory for Europe than Flithwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if both were on different holes at once.
But it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly killed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of a four-ball game when he was married to Alex Noren.
The gods and two double gods in the first nine holes dug out a Spanish and Swedish hole from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
It's so exciting to watch four-balls and four-players play because of the interaction between the couples they're exchanging and who are deliberately silent and how the strategy can change in one moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has made a significant headway on the last day, but this session of the four has also shown that the United States has every effort to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of Ryder Cup, Europe leads with an account of 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the end of the Saturday matches of four balls and fours with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet, Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, led the fight against the two winners of the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National bill to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who wanted to get back lost in Hazeltin two years ago by trophies, dominated the American team's making a mistake in the morning game of four balls, winning the 3-1 bill.
The U.S. resistance was greater in the Thursdays, winning two matches, but they were unable to close the account gap.
Jim Ferik's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophies safe.
Flitwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, after a sensational weekend, became only a second pair who won four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
They broke Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, and then they got together greatly to win over the downed Woods and U.S. new Bryson Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who took two Saturday games, was showing periodic flashes, but now he's lost 19 out of 29 balls, and the four are seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was resting in front of a four-ball game this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in Thursday, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepke with account 2/1 in the first and third place in the world.
For Europe, however, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk by a refreshing day, south-west of Paris.
The three-time champion, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, on Saturday, had two points of reference for Americans.
They won a decisive victory with 2/1 over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Paulter in a four-ball game and returned later to play Polter and Rory McMilroy with 4/3 in the Quartet, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did the team get out of the four-point gap, leaving alone, given that Ferica's team had to play as masters to keep the trophies.
However, after two days of second - place retention, the Sunday counterattack looks like it's beyond their limits.
North Korea says that “categorically” will not disarm unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions increased mistrust of the United States, and that his country would under no circumstances renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong-ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “material goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear test sites and the commitment not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles or develop nuclear technologies.
“However, we do not see a symmetrical response from the United States,” he said.
“There will be no confidence in the US for our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to take the first unilateral action on disarmament.”
While Ry repeated the already-instigated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a “stage-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phinian had done in the past.
Rey referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yun and Donald Trump at the first historic summit between the United States President and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start the movement towards the “delecularization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
The North Korea is seeking to put an official end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for the weakening of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists that the bed should be denuclearized,” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective by force and even opposes “the declaration of the end of the war”, says R.
“The assumption that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who do not know us.
But the real problem is that continuing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the U.S. leader at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae Inh in the last five months and added: “If South Korea were a party to the question of denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been a dead end”.
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed dramatically from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's targeting of missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide missile missile”.
This year at the United Nations Trump, which last year threatened “to destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not indicate any time frame for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months is irrelevant”.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Pyongyang to take steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo stated in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and on a mandatory basis until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cancel the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ree at the United Nations Genus Summit and reported after that meeting that he would visit Pianian again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip had not been successful.
In July, he left Phanyan, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of his visit, North Korea condemned him for his “bandite demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear compound, at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States, for its part, adopts “relevant measures”.
According to Kim, he was told that the “relevant measures” he referred to were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
This year's new course at Harvard University helped all primary school students to learn to sleep more and to fight the Shovinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption with the aim of keeping awake at night.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he thinks is the first of its kind in the United States.
After the opening of the course, he set off on the idea of introducing such a course by giving a report on the impact of lack of sleep on the learning process.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘I'm sorry that I only learned about it as soon as I'm almost done.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, ” he said.
The course offered this year for the first time describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sporting achievement, as well as how it improves a person's common sense of self.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been found that students were experiencing a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, the students perform a series of interactive assignments.
One section of the class offers a picture of a room in a dorm where students, by pressing coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books, receive information on how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light that causes a lack of sleep — affect sports results, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The Combus ' s interactive map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chasler.
He said that the false feeling of pride that a person could “boil all night” was still quite common, and modern technology, just as increasing pressure on students meant that deprivation of sleep was becoming a problem.
He said that a sufficient amount of good-quality sleep was a student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, as under rest led the brain to hunger, forcing it to experience a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course by attending one of the courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campaign.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to attend a similar training programme before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students set up a alarm clock to warn them of falling asleep and waking, as well as of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which violates human biotics and leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Hall Menga brings victory over Gerard's team
The Rangers experienced another sad retreat, as Dolly Menga brought Stephen Gerard's isolated team to account 1:0 in Livingstone.
The Aybrox team hoped to gain its first victory on exit after winning account 4:1 in February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerardo of 18 games as manager, leaving him on eight points behind, giving him an easy victory to Harts, the leaders of the Scottish Prime League.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, who had lost strength, did not seem to be going to equalize the bill.
While Rangers has now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to a third place, and only Hibernian has given up in relation to the ratio of his head.
And Rangers may have additional problems after a linear judge, Kalum Spence, has had to heal a wound on his head after an object has been abandoned from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements on the team that went through the Air in the semi-final for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, for his part, followed the same strategy of Libya 11, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see its well-mandated composition pull the opponents together at every step.
The Rangers may have been led by a sword, but the Livingston has been pressed far more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to kill a needle in just two minutes when Meng Scott Pittman's first gear stopped Allan McGregor, but the para-protector took advantage of the opportunity.
Kihan Jakobs carried out a fine attack on Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, was only able to send the ball to the far side of his pants.
Rangers had been intercepted, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to strike a fine for forty-fifth minutes when he and Stephen Loulis encountered, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
Rangers only had two strikes in the first time, but former Ibroxite, Liam Kelly, had hardly been concerned about Lassan Koulibali's head attack, and Ovi Ejaria's weak impact.
Although the first leg of Libya, which was killed for 34 minutes, may not have been in line with the game, no one can deny that they deserve it solely with their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' playing with the standard situation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallaher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to transfer the ball to Menga for completion.
Gerard took action when he replaced Koulibali with Ryan Kent, and this was almost immediately the result when the extreme paralegal gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to the interception.
But Livingston has continued to attract visitors to the game they intended to play with Litgou and Halket, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGreager was able to block Jacobs before he gave Litgo a field transfer.
The Rangers reserve player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a fine after he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Almanac entitled “Early Morning” is: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Gang” Geiger was born that day.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the basics of science, Geiger's counter also became one of the basics of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s movie “Colocle Coronado”, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — such as scientists seem to be different — in the main roles:
Man: "What's this thing?
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "That's right now!"
Ghans Gaiger died in 1945, did not live only a few days until his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see abnormal cells
A new anti-missile vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and kill an abnormally growing cell
Part of the vaccine's treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalous cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to modify them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this cell change, the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer must then be re-set to 0 cells
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One of the patients who received the vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize the abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to modify them in laboratory conditions, and then the modified cells can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many types of cancer, and then re-entered cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Bethlehem, Maryland, claims: "The results we received are expected to have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Bazofski explains: HER2 “solves the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer and color cancer.
A similar method has been successfully used in leukemia treatment, which has been the removal of immune cells from patients and their “learning” as to how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanje West defended Trump's cap after his entry into the SNL.
It went bad.
Kanje West was refreshed in a studio during a Saturday concert, at which he spoke up in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming that he would take up this post again in 2020.
Following his third song, entitled “The City of Ghost”, which he carried out, he put on the cap “Let America Do the Great Again”, the performer spoke against the democracies and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," said the perpetrator.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon as the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Bretta Kavano's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on Christine Bleisi Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Television did not show how the crowd was disgusted by West, but this video was uploaded on social media by Chris Rock.
It is not clear now whether Rock was trying to mock West by this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that his cap had been ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They were hitting me behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that cap.
They've really been here for me!
Washington Examer quotes him as saying: “And they also said that my position is not cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know that it is not cool to put on a superman's coat so that no one can tell you what to do; do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you will need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL activator seemed to be lost, and one person said to the publication, “The entire studio is in silence”.
West was invited at the last moment to replace Arian Grande's singer whose ex-boyfriend, Ripert McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA Conservative Group leader Kendiz Turner, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: SPASE FOR NUMBER.”
Superintendent Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "the one who he is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creation) who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
She said, “Just like us. ”
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “formedly known as Kanje West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Paff Duddy, Paffy and Pee Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Doga, had the name Snoop Lyon at the beginning, and another example, of course, could be cited as an artist who had recently become a legend, a prince who changed his name into a symbol and then to an artist known as Prince.
Trying to charge murder because of sex at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balikhacomor, according to police reports.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Keith Harington's "Soon Games" has attacked toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as the sword-swording John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series HBO "The Game of Thrones".
However, recently 31-year-old actor warmly criticized the stereotype of macho hero, saying that such characters often make young people think that you must be cruel if you are to be respected.
In his interview, The Sunday Times Culture Keith said that he thought something went wrong and wondered how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on "The Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, his peers, admitted that he was “all unequal” about the problem.
“I take this question very seriously: where did we get the wrong sense of courage?” asks the actor.
"Why do we teach teenagers that we have this problem today?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this upsurge of toxic courage because of too muscular characters.
Acter continues: “What is born and what is acquired?
What are they taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one particular aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, something's really wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any of the spells or sicvels of the Game of thrones, after the show ended the next summer, stating that he had “done out of Battalia and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a major role in the newly filmed "The True West" by Sam Shephard, who tells of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
Acter recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best final for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and a further life,” says the actor.
Rose played Igrist, an object of passion for the character of Keith John Snow in a Phentesian show awarded to Emma.
A couple celebrated a wedding in June 2018 at the family’s family home in Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people are suffering from these diseases in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were recorded.
In the vast majority of new cases, diseases were sexually transmitted, indicating a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections has almost been reduced to zero, as reported by Chinese health representatives at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a severe problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality had been decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT was still widespread.
Studies confirm that, because of the conservative values of the country, 70-90 per cent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters refutes information about the diversion of information from the senators of the Republican Party, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, U.S. Parliament Member Maxine Waters rejected allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
Democracy from Los Angeles claims that the claims were falsified by “ultraly” experts and websites.
“Laying, lying, and lying all the more,” says Waters on his Twitter.
The information published is reported to include home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators, Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during hearings before the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
The escape took place some time after three senators interviewed Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the message was linked to the Waters office, and reported information about Waterers' staff, reporting to Hill.
“This unjustifiable allegation is completely false,” says Waters.
“My staff members whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds have in no way been responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete lie.”
Waters immediately criticized the Internet, including by former White House Spokesperson Ary Fleicher.
“It is an angry denial, ” writes Fleicher.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not appropriate for the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
You don't have to justify yourself either.
And you don't have to dig in the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Fleicher seemed to have compared the reaction of Waterers to criticism of the democracies against Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the seat of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If this is true, it is very important,” he writes.
In her statement, Waters writes that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will see to it that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all and to all of my employees.”
Johnny Inglish strikes again -- weak parody against spy Rowan Atkinson.
Today, it is a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain appears in some way; this is also true of the new parodynian spy-piracy "Agenta Johnny Inglis", which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film "Agent Johnny Ingles: Overload".
Will there be a self-iconistic picture with a leitmotive "it's obvious that we're all shit" of a new attempt at national exports?
At any rate, the prognostic profani Johnny Inglis with a rubber face was given his right to chaos for the second time — his name suggests that he is a broad-screened comic creature designed for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on a glamour slurry, received a little clauseau, a feature of Mr. Bin and a portion of this guy who brought one single note to Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, in which the hero would leave a total chaos behind.
This last issue of JE has one or two nice moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny Inglish was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval prematures, and the elbows are falling on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift of physical execution of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely excessive, especially since “serious” films such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Unfulfillable" now offer the comedy with confidence as an element.
It feels like humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me Johnny Inglish's amazing atrocities are not as resourceful and appropriate as Atkinson's pranks in films about Mr. Bine.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker entered a highly secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an episodic role to play.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, an obstinate and obsessive figure already suffering from a huge political disgruntledness: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can for the character of Kwaz-Treza-May, but there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers told her that since every active spy had been compromised, she would have to get someone out of retirement.
And here is where Johnny Inglish's own personal character, who now works as a school teacher in a pontoon institution, but also gives informal lessons in secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, because Ingles offers the skills of a spy's rock-style Academy.
Inglish is returning to Whitehall for emergency training and is reunited with his former strange friend Buff, who is still playing Ben Miller this time.
Baf is now a married man under the command of a submarine commander, the role of a “joke hockey club”, where Vicki Pepperdin is slightly lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in play because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they're faced with a beautiful rock woman named Ofelia Balletova in the execution of Olga Curilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously exposed to the charm of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
Ingles and Baf begin their porcupine odyssuse: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on Volta's luxurious yacht; Inglis creates complete anarchy in an effort to use a virtual reality garrison to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All these scenes are, of course, nice and boring, but there's something really childish about it.
Full of moderates.
And like Johnny Inglish, I couldn't help but think, "Can't the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's really commensurate with his talent?"
Leiborists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce British workers' workweek to four days in five days' wages.
The Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbina, is going to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party is said to want company managers to pay back savings from the artificial intelligence revolution to employees by providing them with an additional weekend.
This would allow staff members to enjoy three days off for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea of “integrated” into the party's economic agenda and would help the population to take their stand for workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said: The Sunday Times is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work-week is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing the economy's balance in favour of workers, as well as with the Party's overall industrial strategy.”
The Leiborist Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, that desire is now not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered party”.
The Tenet Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference of Leborers last week to define his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power from “invisible directors” and “precursors” of utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current water can't get back all of their shares, because the Labour Government can make “refunds” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to establish funds for Inclusive Overership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector firms ' capital to workers who could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavano can change their opinion
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Bretta Kavano delayed a final election on his appointment as Chief Justice for a minimum of one week and asked whether the Agency ' s findings could encourage any of the senators to support Kavano.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a 60-minute correspondent, interviewed the senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Well, of course”, Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
I called him after it happened, and I heard that information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was decisive, certain and clear.”
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained unstoppable.
“I have decided firmly on Britta Cavanano, and my view can only be changed for reasons that are comparable only to the dynamic,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know is certain: Brett strongly denied it, ” added Graham, addressing Christine Bleisi Ford.
“No one she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
I have seen nothing new in it."
What is Global Cities Festival and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday in New York, there will be a Global City Festival of World Citizens, an annual musical event in which impressive star formations with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, as part of the Festival of World Citizens, tens of thousands of people have flocked to a large central park, not only to enjoy performances by performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez, as well as to describe the real purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the global anti-poverty project carried out by an international group of human rights defenders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you were not prepared to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteer activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the World Citizens Festival been in achieving its goal in 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people to be free at a concert really to persuade fellow citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "callivism" where people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages to Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” have been registered at the festival by its supporters, with many different objectives.
It is recalled that, as a result of these actions, world leaders have promised more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group issued 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which has already been paid or collected.
The group estimated that nearly 649 million people around the world had been directly assisted by the funds allocated.
One of the most significant commitments is the Power of Nutration: the British partnership of investors and implementing professionals committed to “helping children fully discover their potential” pledged to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cities participants.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national Governments and Global Cities, such as you, we can do social injustice with regard to the lack of food by past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutration Tracy Ullmann during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website of the festival, why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
The organizers of Global Citizen say, "It will be a long and difficult way in which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Jeannell Mone are some of the artists who will speak at this year's New York event and will be led by Deborah-Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States of America can use the Navy to prevent the export of Russian energy: Minister of the Interior
The U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, stated that Washington could “if necessary” use its naval fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are some ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke addressed the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that puts itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He then compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel”, said the Minister, calling Russia “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made in connection with the task of the Trump administration to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to break out of the “unsuitable” project of the “North Flow-2” pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin “the planter” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Flow-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the fierce resistance of Washington to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers”, said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Nowak after meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry, through the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes in our energy supplies, this poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI) following the recent meeting of Germany’s Chancellor, Angel Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will study carefully the possibilities for presidential balloting in 2020
Senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that he would study carefully the possibilities of a presidential ballot after an interim election.
In a meeting of the City Duma in Holiooka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think of participating in the pre-election race.
“It's time for women to go to Washington and start our broken government, and it's time for a woman to go up,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will consider carefully the possibility of running for Presidents.”
Warren expressed her appreciation for President Donald Trump's activities during the meeting: “will lead the district in the wrong direction”.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the post of Chief Justice Bretta Kavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we go to vote.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most voters of Warren themselves did not think it should be running in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Studies of Saffolka University/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the Massachusetts “virtible” voters stated that the senator should not stand.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the other hand, supported its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrica: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known names of democracies, which were discussed in connection with the 2020 vision, include former Vice-President Joe Bayden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Bayden claims that he will make an official decision for January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Peylin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder Traka Paylin at a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump.
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now in the same condition as other families who have suffered the consequences of PTSD and were injured, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Peylin called his arrest “a white eye” and said of her son and other veterans of the war:“They are returning already to others, slaughtered, wondering whether their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military force they have given to their country have received the same respect.”
Trak Peylin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, meddling in the situation of violence and possession of weapons in a state of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., supporting the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support the legal challenge of the new US policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 state and district representatives filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum-seeker challenging policy in support of the court.
The complainant's full name in the case “Grace v. Sessions”, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband, “and his sons, members of a criminal group”, ill-treated her, but on 20 July U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace indicate that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are applying for asylum in the United States as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum without documentation.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rusin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “disgraces decades of the application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim and that the prohibition violates this principle,” says a judicial adviser.
Counsel also maintains that policies prohibiting immigrants are detrimental to the U.S. economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensures the necessary labour”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sachns ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Refuge will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief”, said Sachns in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palau: The number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
The situation was becoming more difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult now, ” says a 35 - year - old mother, Rice Kusuma, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palau.
“Every minute, ambulances bring the wounded.
Clean water is in a great deficit.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5 have been overloaded in hospitals affected by the earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwy Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the premises because of the ongoing strong movement.
He weeps when he remembers how a severe earthquake destroyed his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm squeezed into the wreckage of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family came to the city for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and to our baby.
I hope they've been saved and they're all right now."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “aggression” through “advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published four pages of ads in the United States daily, describing the mutual benefits of U.S. trade and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a pay supplement to Das Myines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, making accusations against China in an attempt to intervene in the 6 November U.S. Congress, which China denies.
The charge that Trump was trying to intervene in U.S. elections is evidence of the fact that U.S. officials reported to Reuters: there is a new stage in Washington's growing pressure campaign against China.
While foreign Governments are the norm for advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in a state of escalation in the trade war, resulting in tariffs on imports of their countries.
China's counter-concursive tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trumpa, with the support of Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday’s Des Myines Register, “is now doubling this herb by publishing propaganda in our own free press. ”
“In exacerbating its propaganda, the Chinese Government takes advantage of the expensive American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by paying for and placing advertising in Des Myines Register,” writes Branstad.
“However, in the newspaper stand here, on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see the true diversity of views that the Chinese might have learned about China’s disturbing economic policy, since local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers had “simplified” from the invitation to publish its article, although it did not give the exact title.
Analysts warn that Kavano's delivery pushes women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the sidelines and defend the candidature of Chief Justice Bretta Kavano despite several allegations of sexual violence, while analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially by women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions around this situation have been disheartened, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
Such things cannot be returned later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell’s School at Siracusa University, in his Saturday article.
Rier doubts that the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Orgora) to investigate the FBI at the last minute will suffice to calm down the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the progressive group MoveOn of Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scandalized “No November ahead” against the Senate, when Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavano despite Dr. Christine Bleisi Ford's testimony, tells Mic.
“democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond bounds, ” said political statesman Stu Rotenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already got pretty bad, and that's true.
But things can get worse, especially for women voters in suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of Chief Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the proposal, that step could trigger a reaction.
“It is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republic earlier last week, as reported by NBC News.
“It is not only a matter of vote in a committee or a final vote, or whether Kavano has sat on a bench of defendants, but also of how the Republicans deal with it as they relate to it,” says Guy Cecil, director of Parliaments USA, groups that assist in the election of democracies, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe — Ford or Cavanaugh — and are slightly more inclined to take sides with the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe exactly or most likely in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say that they believe exactly or most likely Kavano.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano is most likely or definitely lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford sworn in before the Senate Legal Committee that Kavano had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramírez claims that the candidate for the post of Chief Justice showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access which information.
In an exclusive interview, Last Company Berners-Li joked that the aim of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We must do it now,” he says of his startup.
“It is a historic moment”.
The annex uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spatify -- everything can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is managed entirely by a user who can access any information he needs.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to John Bruce's Director General, the idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted for the project, and a volunteer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make radical changes that would make all their business models change completely overnight.
“We don't ask them for permission.”
In his post on Midium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate over network neutrality in recent months.
Even with the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Li will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet age,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Churchman, awarded by Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, a event that was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the attack against Bellenglis and Leukour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later without ever knowing that he had received a higher British military reward.
A monument to this event was solemnly presented by his two grandchildren at the Ruschden parade, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic”, that the monument had been opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received his reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the St. Canton Canal “in a very dense fog and under the heavy fire of field weapons and machine guns”.
He later rushed to the fire line and led the group forward with the greatest courage and then, with one hand, threw a gun at the field and knocked down three soldiers of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
A 72-year-old grandson of a hero, Michael Vann, said that “he would hardly have been able to do the same heroically, but it would have humbled”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the importance of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
IMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they were given Peppu lead
Imagine you haven't slept all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you're not allowed to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 combats, including six major programs, and the fighting was broadcast live all night on 5 British television channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Hegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British fans were furious when they saw Pepke's lead screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch fights.
One Twitter fan called this change in the children's cartoon “some sort of sick joke”.
“It has been decreed by the State that for 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, so they have had to switch to childhood programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Pepp's pig."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they were planning to make a schedule so that they could also watch British viewers in the future.
“If it comes to re-showing, I think we can solve this issue,” says Coker.
“But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we won't be able to resolve this until Sunday after our time, and for them it's Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a lot of text messages came out, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were just trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out no, it was a matter of State importance.
I promise I won't do that next time.
We're going to reduce the fighting to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we've got a victory.
Yes, it was not good."
Disert Islanddiscs: Tom Daley felt inadequate because of his sexual orientation
Olympia Diver Tom Daily says he grew up feeling worse than everyone because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said that he did not realize that “not everyone like him” until he went to secondary school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme, led by Laurent Laverne, he said he spoke of gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that the victory in the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a baby.
Kirsty Young, the Permanent Leader of the multi-year show, took several months' leave because of his illness.
Daily, who served as the main guest in Laverne's programme, said that he felt “more worthless than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both boys and girls”.
He says: “To this day, these feelings of worthlessness and inappropriateness have been very real, but they gave me strength, and I have been successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned of his sexual orientation.
A two-fold bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time champion of the world said that the feelings for a man, American director Dastin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were “swept by him”.
Daily married an Oscar laureate 20 years older last year, but claims that age difference was never a problem.
“If so much is happening in your life at such a young age”, he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a peer who has the same radical life experience.
A couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black Dataley, and Daley said that “all his world perception” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know, there are things and important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not want to accept his death, and one of his latest requests was a front-line ticket to London 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, "Pope, you'll be gone, and you won't be able to sit in the front row," says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized that he was not invincible, ” says the athlete.
The following year, Daily participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming of all my life — to dive before a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, to feel no better, ” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Other Small — which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still loves him so much.
Disert Islanddiscs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 English Summer Time.
Michaelson, who is not in shape, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game of Ryder Cup, but he'll have to pull his uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michaelson, who played the biennal for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürik to the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as has often been the case in the United States, a five-fold major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game in the hope of remedying what was disturbing him.
Never with the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the Le Holf National hard track, where long ruff usually punishs for inappropriate blows.
And if the course is not sufficiently frightening in itself, Michaelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will meet with an accurate British Open French Molinari champion who joined up with a new guy, Tommy Flitwood, to win all four games this week.
If Americans who lose four points in 12 single matches make a bright start, Michaelson's match can be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could have said.
“He fully understood the role entrusted to him today, patted me on my back, hugged me and said that tomorrow would be ready, ” Ferik commented.
"He's pretty sure of himself.
He's walking the Hall of Glory, and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Micelson will beat Nick Foldo's record by number of match numbers in Ryder's Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never met the heights of its individual record.
Micelson has 18 wins, 20 strikes, and seven others, although Ferik said that his presence had been of great benefit to the team.
“He's funny, he's saucy, he's sharp, he likes to teach people, and he's a great guy with whom he's interested, ” he explained.
“I think young players have had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see it.
His game is much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that a great advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a major single-level leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn in an adverse direction.
Dancian debuted in the match in 1997 in Valderram, where the Northiano Ballesteros team had five points over the Americans, but had overcome the final line just a little bit ahead of the lowest difference, winning with an account of 141 *2-131 *2.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but just now,” said Björn, in a photograph following the 2018 class review, winning the field Le Golf National, with an account of 5-3 Fridays and yesterday, which resulted in an account of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the entire team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do it right.
As long as the glasses are not on the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win the trophies, and that's what we need to focus on.
I was not silent, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that what we are against is against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied by the way his players made themselves available on a golf course for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in this.
There's another test tomorrow.
One-on-one interventions begins tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're experiencing all your powers as a professional golfer.
That is the kind of thought that needs to be inspired by the players so that they can be put on top of it tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must do his best too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that his players will speak better individually than his partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who had three points of four.
Ferik himself has spent all this last day, becoming part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he finally loses when Europe spent the “Medina miracle”.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, Captain in 1999, put together his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish all of this quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it exerts a lot of pressure on the match in the middle.
We've set up our plan for the game and set up the guys as we thought was right, you know, tomorrow we're going to try to create a miracle."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McMilro in a top mat with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this particular group of guys, and in this order, because I think they're going to cover up all the possible shortcomings”, said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The introduction of a new German warship has once again been postponed
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace old warships of the cold war, but this will not happen at least next year due to faulty systems and a vindictive cost increase, reports local media.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Paltza, the main ship of the completely new frigates of the Baden-Würtemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, with reference to the military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery made the future of the ambitious project more difficult.
The four vessels of the Baden-Würtemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by old Bremen's freghammers.
It is known that they will have a powerful gun, multiple anti-aircraft missiles, and some “tables” technologies — such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods — it must be possible to deploy the latest fregs for a period of up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the constant delay in the operation means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they become armed, notes Die Zeit.
The F-F-125 hacked into news headlines last year, when the German Navy formally refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned the ship to the shipmaster after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that rendered a warship useless in combat.
The software deficiencies were particularly critical, as vessels of the Baden-Würtemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the labour force in old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy to reduce its productivity and to limit the ability of the Navy to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-tone Rhineland Phaltz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to broken equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering Euro3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original Euro2.2 billion.
The problems of keeping the newest frigates on anchor are particularly important in the light of recent warnings to reduce Germany ' s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the naval force had in fact “ends a fleet of ships capable of deployment”.
The official said that the problem had escalated over time because old ships had been removed from service, but no ships had been provided for them.
He visited that not one of the Baden-Würtemberg fregs could ever be armed by a fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouses
A new study carried out in one of the towns of the Scotland Hill is designed to show how flying mice use the landscape in search of food.
It was to be hoped that the data received would allow a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help to further preserve the species.
A study organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common neuters, soprano neuters and brown long-haired flying mice and Dobanton nighttimes inhabited by Investigated Gardens, Western Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some locations around the site to track the effects of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using hand detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the records will determine the frequency of the shouting, as well as the activities for which the various groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be prepared and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Duar, NTSS Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to define the main areas of work for the management of habitats, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways of maintaining forest ranges as optimal for bats and other related species.
The populations of flying mice in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined significantly over the last century.
They are in danger of extinction due to construction and 90-per-year construction, which affect their habitat and habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a danger, as well as glue for flies, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
Actually, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echoing techniques to precisely identify obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of bats.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, on-site checks and sometimes rescue work.
The Organization has even established the first and only reserve in Scotland for flying mice in the Treave area of Damfries and Gallowe, where eight of the 10 species of Scottish flying mice live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the name is ideal for them.
"Here in Freve, excellent place for flying mice," he says.
“There are old buildings here, many old trees and all the elements of a good environment.
But much remains unknown about flying mice, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a secure existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking that there were bats before performing maintenance within the private domain, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could result in the death of up to 400 females and young persons and perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected by law, their destruction, digestion or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish officer of the Foundation for the Conservation of Flying Mouses, calls for help from the public.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our flying mice, and we just don't know how many different species live.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine
Krishtian Ronaldu denies the allegations of rape against him, calling them “pestilence news” and claiming that people are simply “thought to propagandize” using his name.
His lawyers are going to go to court on the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published charges against a football player.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were accused of rape by an American woman named Catherine Majorga, allegedly in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident and reported on Friday "Spigel".
Speaking in Instagram, where a football player has 142 million subscribers, several hours after the charges were reported, Ronald called this information “peak news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all the fair news, ” claims Balon d'Or's five-time winner on camera.
"They just want to propagandize by using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their work.
I’m a happy person, and I’m all great, ” adds a smile sportsman.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for charges they have described as “unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage corresponding to the seriousness of the legal violation which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the House of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Upon meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorg allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal form, according to documents presented to Clarke District Court in Nevada.
Majorg claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her knees and told her that he was “99% good guy but he was a 1% blackout”.
It is alleged that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was by mutual agreement.
Majorg also claims that she turned to the police and that she was photographed in the hospital of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear that she would be punished” and feared“public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her residence as she continued to experience the traumatic feelings resulting from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he entered the Italian giant South in a deal of Euro100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain “wishs for permanently lost motor vehicles”
The Business and Enterprise Minister, Greg Clarke, stated that Britain “will regret it forever” if, after Brexit, it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing.
He also commented that Toyata UK had informed BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal”, said Mr. Clarke.
A Japanese car manufacturer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyopa Auris and Avenue, and last year it released almost 150,000 vehicles, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, manager of Toyampa in Bernaston.
Other U.K. car manufacturers expressed concern about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to manufacturers, if there is no Brexit transaction, the supply chain will be put at great risk.
The Toy® production line shall be launched “at an accurate time” and the details for the vehicles commissioned shall be supplied by the British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain withdraws from the EU on 29 March without a transaction, there may be disruptions at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may result in delays and shortages of parts.
According to the company, Toy® will not be able to store stocks at its factory in Derbyshire for longer than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan, presented at Churchers, for future relations with the EU, was “pretentiously calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow not only success at this time but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 today.
“Not only Toy®, but other producers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyampa was unable to clarify the time frame for production to stop, but in the longer term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the manager of the factory trade union, says the concern of the organization's members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to White House information.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosestein could be “removed to another week”, since the struggle for Brett Kavano's appointment as Chief Justice was ongoing, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is responsible for the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who investigates Russia ' s interference with elections, links between Trump and Russia ' s assistants and potential obstacles to the President ' s justice.
Whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Attorney-General from office, thereby endangering the independence of Müller, in Washington, D.C., has caused a lot of speculation for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of presidential impeachment through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refutes this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, Thursday was announced a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “would prefer not” to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Bleisi Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the complaints of the FBI in Kavano, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
The Spokesperson of Trump, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, or perhaps another week, given all other developments before the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
The head of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the absence of briefings is not due to the “view of the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing on the public”.
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President meets more in answer to the questions of journalists than any other President before him”, she added, without, however, adding the exact figures: “We have these figures”.
Sanders believed that briefings would continue, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than talking to me”.
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've met in the last few weeks, and if you can speak directly to the President of the United States, this is a decent replacement for press briefings.”
The Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with high-ranking persons.
Conferences are rare for the press alone.
The frivolalism, and sometimes the strange conduct of the President before journalists gathered this week in New York, may be the answer why this is so.
The Minister of Health writes to EU employees in Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health asked EU staff working in Scottish GCS to express their gratitude on behalf of the whole country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to employees less than six months before leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the cost of processing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The talks between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer and the expected decision must be delivered.
However, the British Government is also increasing preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, right now I want to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Peers from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, of course, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie carried out emergency head injury surgery
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Christian Abercrombie's para-protector, Tennessee State Tigers, had undergone an emergency operation after his head injury on Saturday, 31-27, in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee, Rod Read, told journalists that the trauma had been sustained shortly before the break.
“He went up to the side line and just collapsed there,” said Reid.
Coachers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
The official from Tennessee told Chris Harris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had an operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the type/stape of injury are available yet” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, only a second year, it was the first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher price for the purchase of real estate in Britain.
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers would be charged with higher fees when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional funds would be used to help the homeless.
This step will neutralize Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
The high fees will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million per year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher collection for the purchase of real estate in Great Britain, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless — today Theresa May will be announced.
This step will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters who promise to make housing more accessible and incomes more available to citizens.
Increased fees would be charged to individuals and firms that did not pay their taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus raised should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The allowance for the current collection of camels, including the increase introduced two years ago in the acquisition of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
Treasury expects that this step will provide up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London real estates are not purchased by British residents, leading to price increases and making it difficult for buyers who buy their first housing to improve their housing conditions later.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the large number of foreign buyers who have bought housing here and spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction firms of charging real estate prices, but did not actually use them, and called on Ms. May to give up the quota for affordable housing to remedy the “debt housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include rent control and an end to undue evictions.
He also wished to give the local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my tenure to the fulfilment of the British dream — to make life better with every new generation.
This, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
It is not fair, however, that people who are not British citizens as well as foreign companies have the same access to real estate as working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too distant, and the threat of some being on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to run Scotland.
The Sundling Club Boss Jack Ross says that his “end objective” is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
A 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the reviving of the North-East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league, which separates from the first three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after he returned to Scotland's Prime League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got cap B, and that's it,” said Ross Sports Bond BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching with my father in Scotland in Hammden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, Sundile were also Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paulo De Canio.
The former manager, Alloya Athletic, says that he was not anxious about such authoritative names in such large clubs, having previously abandoned the proposals of Barnley and Ipswich Town.
“To me success for the moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Prime League.
In its structure and capacity, the club certainly belongs to the Prime League,” the coach said.
“It's not easy to get him out there, but I'm going to think I've done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross only serves as manager for three years, first serving as assistant manager in Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Hitts Training Staff.
Then he helped Alloy get up from third level and next season he took St. Morning out of his lower position to win the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Merren and Hamilton Academy.
"It must have been a real intersection," he recalls his responsible work in Alloya.
“I sincerely believed that management was more suitable for me than games.
That sounds strange, because I did all right, earned a good job in this position and made some progress.
But play is more complicated.
There are a lot of things you have to do weekly.
I still have stress on my job, but I feel good about being a manager.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, by doing this, I feel most comfortable as a fish in water throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, 17:30 — ideal time for beer pints
Summer heat has led to increased sales of British pubs, but it has reduced sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company CGA, who received this statistics, says: “Frontal solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England's participation in the World Championship, means that July continued its trend the previous month, June, when the pub sales grew by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants, on the other hand, significantly decreased.”
June ' s decline in restaurant earnings by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
Herbs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results in restaurants.
Food - sold pubs also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There's a sense that people want to jump out of the street just to miss a glass.
The sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food increased by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting activities remain critical when it comes to sales on the non-expendable market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful because of the continuing price pressure.
A long, hot summer has proved more than ever to be for food operators, and it is not yet true that August, with more moderate temperatures, will give much-needed relief.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in branding.
Monitoring of the sector sales of Coffer Pach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses data on the productivity of 47 networks with combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry reference.
1 out of every 5 children has secret accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, 1 out of every 5 children — some as young as 11 years of age — have secret accounts on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the page of the “fee instinct”
This news increased concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent said they had a “core” account that parents know about
However, 1 out of every 5 children — some as young as 11 years of age — creates social networking accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of feces “instas” — i.e. Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news increased concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty per cent of students stated that they had a basic, “clean” account to which their parents had access, but also secret accounts.
One mother who accidentally obtained access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account came across a teenager who called on others to “rape him”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) revealed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social media profiles, half of whom admitted that one was generally secret.
Chapter HMC Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and that's a disturbing fact."
Alyd Doyle will become the “voice of athletes” of Scottish light athletes
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Ailed Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Light Athletes as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous athletic athlete, and President Ian Beatty claims that this is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the extensive experience of international athletes over the past decade.
“Ailed enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world momental community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to the light athletics in Scotland,” says Beatty.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can truly make a good contribution and promote sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a private commentator on BBC, after a stroke was carried out, he lost his ability to walk.
He writes on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me whether I would be OK and, if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I was fully cured, newly learned to walk, and today I am doing fishing exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!"
Maltosos ads, where nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk company has raised disputes on the Internet by publishing an advertisement where nursing mothers are compared to milk cows.
In a market release, it has been said, “the world’s first silent milkus that can be carried on the breasts”, Elvie’s consumer technology company published an advertising music video showing the freedom that the new milky mother gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a full-time cow's room under a musical track, where they say, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you don't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wash-off, it's my breast."
And the chorus goes on to say, "We're sucking, we're sucking, we're feeding our babies with breast milk, we're sucking, we're sucking."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the viewers, many saying that it sheds light on the milk industry's “pestilences”.
“A very poor decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth, ” writes one user.
Alvie milk is put directly under the special budget (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk eaters for mothers who leave their children behind?"
Another user adds: “Averted ad”.
Others, on the other hand, protected the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great”.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I fed the baby, I would have bought one.
The breast feeding really made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A brilliant product, ” wrote one user.
And another comment: “A fancy ad designed for mothers who breast-feed (often they do it right in their workplaces or in their toilets) and who, indeed, feel a little bit like cows.
This ad is not to praise or challenge our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these imperceptible milk eaters hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is precisely based on the fact that many breast - feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie milk is completely insatiable, without wires or tubes, freely placed in a nursing budget, while allowing women to move, keep young children and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood specialist at Mother, comments: “Lolotos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
As a parallel between women and stepmothers, we wanted to focus attention on breast-feeding and all its problems, showing in a joking and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that gives new milk.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is in the headlines.
During London’s fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Yakubowski using this product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children moved freely to a tent camp along the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trumpa authorities have made it difficult for children to be placed with their sponsors.
Most sponsors themselves are usually the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by sponsoring the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, witnessed to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to be seconded to the remaining minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
“About 80 per cent of the persons who are either mediators or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign perpetrators.
We are therefore continuing to prosecute these people,” said Albens.
In an effort to speed up the process of child custody, officials have introduced new regulations that require some of them to be tried within a month of detention, rather than 60 days later.
In order to claim their legal status to an immigration judge, many are present on video links rather than in person.
Those considered to be not entitled to assistance would be deported quickly.
According to shelters and information in the system in recent months, the more children remain in detention, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or say good-bye to friends may add to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had been going on in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembled.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “the spread of irrational insurance” that had led refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens”, he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major compound of the Idlib rebels provided an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a widespread attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “a clear time frame” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the Al-Qaida-related militia of the Nusr front, who would “be destroyed”.
UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened shortly, which will include representatives of the Government and the opposition, in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the Commission's work should be limited to “review of articles of the current Constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wins Second Time
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the election in 2020 if the impeachment and the scandal do not bring his presidency to an early end, which is probably the hope of many liberal spectators.
And that will no doubt be “the most dramatic finality of the presidency ever!”
At present, there is no sign of the weariness of the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled — to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times — to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddown Show" has exceeded the ratings of cable channels by collecting 3.5 million viewers on screens at evenings during the main news show.
“This is a fire to which people are drifting because it is beyond our comprehension,” says Neil Bair, director of ABC's "Appointed Survival" drama, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes President after Capitol has been destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skovelle, a long-published comedy writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about entry into the Club of the Gollys of the Woods Boys”, offers another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi once in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?”, she asked.
He replied, “Because he's funny! ”
In all of this chaos, there is something valuable — fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington's story lines can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and global health.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Yet, when you have been watching for six hours in a row, how a group of experts discuss Bob Woodworth's use of a "smooth background" for his book "Strach," or Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from ostriches (a garment of proud pride," says Washington Post), or the sharp description of Storm Daniels, say, Mr. Trumpe's anatomy, is already beyond the reach of ordinary awareness.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes, for example.
“In part his work is to make us feel that reality shows are that he feeds you on something every night, ” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Heelhouse Entertainment, and author of Pawn Stars on the changing actor composition of the Trump show and the daily turning of the story.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleas this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the northern coast of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during CNN's recording.
He could not withdraw from the screen, at least not when he showed how Brett Kavano appeared before the Senate Legal Committee and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” says Mr. Fleys.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Outseyder money is being poured into the harshest interim elections run by the White House.
It is no wonder that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash flows through changes in the districts at the Congress, where two officials are in the race for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has recently changed, supports a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who took place in another district in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another official in office, the Republic of Quit Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps substantially with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that, as a result of pre-election schemes, old areas had been attributed to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district generated a heated debate on the financing of the campaigns between the main party, the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March-based special elections to Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the democracies a small advantage.
The United States ordered El Salvador for its support of China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to a negative reaction by Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and was also in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, as stated earlier this month by the Spokesperson of the Department of Heser Nauert.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received some $140 million of American aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior management representatives had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward and had actually discontinued consideration of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October, and Vice-President Mike Pens will address it in recognition of the fact that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without carrying any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports confirm an outside analyst who is part of the administration but who also spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The next step may be a report by Special Adviser Robert Müller on possible interference with Mr. Trump ' s justice, which is now well documented in public records.
Mr. Müller is also reportedly investigating the existence of the Trump campaign with Russia and its attack in the past elections.
If the Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will appear in the face of responsibility in this body, just as he prepares to address the voters again, and perhaps eventually to a jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of "if"; I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d ' état and overthrow Hitler, which would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakian troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid further years of bloodshed.
The course of history is at such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosestein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Müller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed last year to make secret records of the President ' s activities and to reason on his unservice for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argued that the Times were incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Britta Kavano is not complete or true, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the medium term in favour of the Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe we can go through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied an ambassador's house, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later led me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past as I may not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the collision with the football club in Vienna.
The Rangers accept the Vienna “Rapid” on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive Nobody in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take strong positions in the G-group of the League of Europe.
The injury of the knee prevented the para-protector Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season until nobody at the rate of 2:2 vs. Villarreala, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good time for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said a 31-year-old football player.
“We entered the game, believing we could get something, but left with no one.
In the end, we may have been able to handle it, but in general, no one was likely justly able to do so.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they showed us a good outcome in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely heavy, given all my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautiful, and the guys are really enjoying it; they've been trained on "ura."
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear for their pension savings
Although the interviewers had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few had spoken to their family members about it.
About half of those who participated in the nationwide study said that they had discussed with their spouses the value of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they had spoken to their children on this subject.
“People want to be cared for by some family member but do not try to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationalside on Life Insurance.
That's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for what they may have to care for unless you express your wishes beforehand.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will receive medical treatment, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
In consultation with your financial adviser, he will help you to develop a plan to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care policy or a mixed monetary life insurance policy, which will help to cover these costs or self-insured by your own property, provided you have money.
Get your legal documents out of order.
Trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that consideration be given to the possibility of developing financial trust.
A trusted person should be chosen to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are not in a position to do so.
Do not forget the small things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed emergency medical care, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to provide information on what medication he takes and on what he has allergies for?
Write down all these details on paper so you can prepare yourself in case you want.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have finance, but also to choose doctors”.
"What kind of drugs do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Write down and write down the plan.”
In Ilfrakomb, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle.
The man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose stomach and hand had been hit by bullets for 40 years, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfrakomb, Devon.
The police described the shooting that took place at about 02:30 a.m., in English summer, as “by accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are not life threatening, the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the breakdown of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Palau, which is closer to the 7.5 point of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau as a result of the disaster.
Some key facts about Palau and Donggal, located on the island of Sulavesa, are:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala is an area extending over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular of the Donggala coastal region.
nickel mining is also important for the economy of the province, but mainly concentrated in Morwali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has destroyed several times in Palau and Donggal over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also occurred in Western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia ' s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami in 14 countries that killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia ' s most populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: A magnitude earthquake of 7.6 occurred in Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mantawa islands of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidy Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: The heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily under ruins.
Senior son of Sarah Peylin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Peylin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and Vice-Centat to President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Peylin, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in the situation of domestic violence and resisting the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTU, Paylin is in Matt-Su detention centre and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “uniform innocence”.
Paylin is threatened with three minor crimes of Class A, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined for $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Peylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Peylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, falsification of the report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sara Peylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining his son's violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, north-east of Jakarta, Indonesia ' s capital.
Video recordings of an accident appear on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palau when the tsunami hit a beach.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office wishes to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
The Federal Public Prosecutor ' s Office in New York seeks the death penalty for Saifullo Saipa, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the death of eight people, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intently” killed eight people and “intently” caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of the intention to achieve the death penalty given in New York district.
According to a court document, both charges are likely to result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read Saipa ' s conviction with 22 counts, which included eight allegations of murder for the purpose of re-quest, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “pretentiously planned and deliberate”, Saipov carried it out as described, “in a repugnant, cruel and criminal manner”.
“Seifullo Habibullawevich Saipov suffered injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevez, Anne-Lor Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernán Ferruci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagukko”, says the notification of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor demanded the death penalty for criminal offence in the South District of New York.
In September 2009, the accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The most recent death penalty in the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the cold war.
Rosenberges were executed using an electric wall on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov ' s judicial records, a Uzbek citizen had shown a lack of repentance following his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch the IGIL video on the phone.
He also asked for ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, reported to the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the Saipa side, said that they were “evidently disappointed” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without release will only add to the pain of those events for all participants,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipa had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tori said that NAJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Faraz vowed to “mobilize the People's Army”.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should “sensitize” the Euro-skeptics, since one of the members of Parliament, Teresa May, had suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, a member of the conservative party at the Birmingham meeting, said that Britain would already “come out” if Mr. Farazew was Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile its deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party opposing EU withdrawal join in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to preserve his compromise plan, which was announced at Churchers in the midst of attacks by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reactions and thus force the Europeans and Labourers to choose between her package and the Haos.
Mr. Boone said at the Leave Means Leave's meeting that he wanted to "win out."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be leveled and held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
Deputate Wellingborough added, "I'll continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play Churchers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the voting of 2016: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain is totally wrong”.
Brexit's support for Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving the journalists this comment: "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people."
“Checkers is not popular among the general public; the opposition is not going to vote in favour of this plan; it is also not popular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and first and foremost electing us.
Please put Checkers aside and start listening to what you are told."
In her harsh speech to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain at work if they remain true to their promises”.
Mr. Faraz said that if politicians were going to submit a decision taken at the 2016 referendum, then they should be forced to “feel”.
“It is now a question of trust between us people and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Addressing an exhausted crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit's betrayal, to feel at ease.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud by the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit’s opponents held a demonstration on Birmingham, followed by a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
A number of activists waved "Trexit v. Brexit" posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Leyborist Party, criticized the conservatives because of security problems in their mobile annex.
“And these people claim to be able to build the IT systems and technologies of Canada plus, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland”, he added.
“It's one complete farce.
A good Brexit does not exist in principle, ” he claims.
Warren plans “to study closely” the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Member of Parliament of the United States, said that, after the November elections, it would “make an accurate study of the possibility of voting for Presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democracy described its future at the West Massachusetts Hall Hall meeting on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dyel, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she's got a chance to take Trump's post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held another meeting with the voters; since Trump took office, it had already been her 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to ‘ fix’ our broken government, and to do so it would be necessary for a woman to be upstairs”.
As a result of the murder of Sims (intended), LSU player was arrested
The Baton-Ruze police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that LSU Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
At 11:00 an English time at a press conference, the Baton-Rose police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department published a video of the shooting requested to help identify the person who was able to film.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near South University Campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head and died”, stated police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to participating in the incident, carrying a weapon and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist during his arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Ruz District Police Department.
The young man grew up in Baton Ruz and played 32 games with 10 startups last season, and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points per game.
Grand Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of the World Champion after command tactics have given him victory over Sebastian Fetel
From the time that Walter Bottas was trained on Saturday, it became clear that Lewis Hamilton's command tactics would play a major role in the race.
From the post post office of Bottas, he started well and practically hanged on Hemilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettitel first went to the pit stop and left Hemilton crambling in the tail of the entire group -- a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes left one circle at a pit stop and then left behind Feckel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, stepped forward, resulting in the reluctance of the Ferrari driver to leave the internal space unfettered, at risk of being stuck after a double movement to protect himself on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstapen started at the back of a series of nets and was seventh in place by the end of the first circle.
He then led most of the race on his native tires with the aim of quickly completing, giving Kim Ryckonen fourth place.
He eventually went to a pit stop on the 44th circle, but he couldn't increase the pace on the remaining eight circles, because Rockkonnen took fourth place.
The day seemed difficult, as Walter did a fantastic work for the weekend and showed me a real beauty by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks on the reserve," said Hamilton.
Presumptive sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Fainstein in a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not published a letter from Christine Bleisi Ford, accused of Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the position of supreme judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention directly the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what took place in the Senate had shown that the participants in those events were “smooth, hideous and lying people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what's happening in the Senate in the last few days, is beautiful, is anger, anger, disgustingness and lies,” he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diann Fainsten, did you "listen" information?
Remember her answer... did you "listen" the document? - "What, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't merge.
Okay, stop.
No, we didn't, ” he added, with the inflammation of the senator.
In July, Feinsinstein sent a letter detailing the charges brought against Kavano, and in early September it was illegally promulgated, but Fainstein denies that the leak took place in her office.
“I haven't concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, but I haven't merged her information,” said Fainstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information confidential, and I did as she asked”.
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of diversion did not seem to be pleasing to the President, who commented on this during the Saturday meeting: “This is what I'm going to say to you: the body language has failed her.
Maybe she didn't "swept," but the body's language was the worst I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend his candidate for the post of Chief Justice, whom three women had been accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the democracies were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
“We see a gentleness, an indecency, no matter whom they insult, through whom they must step to gain power and control,” quotes Mediaite as the president said.
British hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Duyer killed two nudes for "Jeanths" in a game against "Dandi"
In an Elite hockey League game, Dundee Stars paid for a Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants by winning a Saturday match in favour of Dundee.
"Jayants" received an early two-foot advantage due to the beatings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowillar.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of their home team before Dwyer led James into the leaders.
François Bushhar compared the count of Dundee before the two heads of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen established their victory.
For Adam Cephas who won the Dundee account 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties in the "Jeanths" season when three previous matches won.
Duyer's first goal came at 3:35 a.m. after Cendal McFall's play, with David Rutherford's support, after which Bovier doubled the privilege four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney level the account at 15:16.
Duyer found that Jayants had intercepted the initiative at the first break, when he scored the second goal after the night at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bouchar rebalancing the bill, scored a score at a multiple of 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nilsen to give the Dundee the opportunity for the first time in a match to gain leadership at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, established the victory by holding his rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jaiants, who have lost four of the last five matches, are now on their way to Milton Kens for the next match on Friday.
Air traffic traffic control died so that hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic control was posthumously assigned to the hero's rank after he deliberately went to death to allow a plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared as a result of the severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground pushes continue to destroy the area, and many of the inhabitants of the town of Palau are trapped in the debris of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antónius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutíar Cisse Al-Jufra airport, in Palau.
He stayed in his seat to see that the Batik Airlight 6321 aircraft, which was on the airstrip at the time, had been able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the tower was falling, he jumped off it.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of Indonesia's Aeronautics, Johannes Sirait, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter arrived in Palau.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that thousands of people may die as a result of the earthquake, as according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still trapped and many have never been able to get out of there,” says a representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The winds, which reached a height of six metres, devastated the city of Palau, where the mass burial of the dead would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Rice Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “Sudden relief brings victims every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markers are everywhere looted.”
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross staff are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
President Joco Vidodo of Indonesia arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the country ' s armed forces, saying, inter alia: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? ”
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that one person disappeared after the crash of a plane in a lagoon
The flight company that carried out the disaster in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports that one person was missing, whereas earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini states that as of Saturday afternoon it has no information on one male passenger.
The company stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and an aircraft crew after they fell on the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday six passengers had been hospitalized and all were in stable condition.
The reasons for the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Air companies and U.S. Navy claim that the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airstrip.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane has begun to enter the airstrip too low.
“And that’s very good, ” Janes adds.
Janes told us that he and other passengers had been able to make emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was over the belt.
He also told us that the stewards panicked and shouted on board and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing nearby docks also helped to rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry people to shore before the plane reached water about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data show that over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in air accidents involving airlines registered in PNG, but none of these were related to Air Niugini.
The intelligence analyst was able to prove that the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave a long-term statement as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used mobile phone records to give a general picture of the actions of the 29-year-old accused, Quinn Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis spent the night with Chambers, contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his cell phone was located near Chambers; when this turned out to be the case, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford stated in his testimony that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was right, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville”.
Another difference was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to telephone records, they were only convened within one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, she removed text messages, phone calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale says.
The defence must begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the "knowable hip hop"?
The hip hopper trio is going to fight against negative attitudes towards this gen by filling his music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the content of the hip hop has changed from original political and social problems.
The group wants to get back to its roots and make the hip hop famous again.
Artists like The Fegues and Common recently witnessed a resurgence in Britain thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
The New York nanny sued a family couple because of racist text.
The New York nanny sued a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a communication from a woman complaining that the nanny was “one black” who had mistakenly sent the nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racists, claiming that the claim is filed with “the aim of extortion”.
Lance Placco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by Child Care Service, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at her family for her first day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
However, instead of texting her husband, she had twice mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris.
Having learned of her bitterness, Placco-Flexman dismissed Morris, stating in the service that the nanny, who proved to be an African American, had been doing her job badly, and that they were expecting a Filipino woman rather than an African American woman, reports New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Moreis is now suing a family couple and demanding compensation for the dismissal of $350 per day in six months, in accordance with the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable,” she said, “Past” on Friday, adding, "And I know that this is discrimination."
Spouses disagree with the accusations of racism and claim that the dismissal of Morris could be considered a reasonable step, since they could no longer trust her if she offended her.
“My wife sent to her in a message something she didn’t really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joe Placco, a husband in Post.
"But you'd trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you'd done it without wanting it?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!"
Calling the action “expulsion”, Placco said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and had been in a “very difficult situation”.
“And are you ready to persecute the person in this situation?
Not very nice of you, ” added a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already passed its sentence on social media, accusing a couple of unacceptable behaviour and of having problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with the speaking bear, says a new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the publication had been accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the first reader before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has great success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a book about a baby bear, had been an operator on BBC and would have refused to publish with optimism, and added that his 60-year anniversary was “and happy and bitter” since the author had not been present in the past year.
With regard to Paddington's mother bear itself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family”, and her father was very proud that his character eventually became known.
"He was a quiet and modest man," his daughter says.
“It was as real to him as it was to him, and it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own credit.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Podddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Following the landing of the plane, her daughter was taken to Nizza Hospital Hospital Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“There has been a regular call and saying that everything is really bad, that something has gone wrong, ” says Mrs. Ednán-Laperus.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we should say good-bye.
I did.
I said, "You know, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually ceased to function as she left her body.
She died before she expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I could not cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.”
After all, Mrs. Ednán-Laperus, who was about to lose her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, on account of the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“No one around us knew what had happened, ” she says.
“ My head fell, and I cried.
It's hard to explain, but it was during my flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women survivors prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put cards on the Welles Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can ask for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and when he was 18, he killed himself.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says that her son was a great cook and had a damn lovely smile.
"All loved his smile.
Everyone said, "When he smiles, it's like a light burning in the room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was experiencing truly terrible times.”
That happened in 2014, and Tyler, who had died, found his own brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm not afraid I'm going to have a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards so people know there's someone to talk to, even if there's a friend of yours.
We must not sit down and keep quiet, but we must speak to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, and did not happen shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, upset or something," she said.
"Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was particularly ill at Christmas when he did not even look at the children when they opened their gifts."
She says that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it, this event shocked our family.
It broke her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Britta Cavanano hangs in his hair: the FBI is launching an investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked us to do — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring in at least a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “disintegrated” against a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his followers not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The interim elections will be held only five weeks later, on 6 November, and if, as is expected, things go wrong for the Republicans, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavano ' s support, who had been working in the White House for Mr. Bush since then and who, thanks to Bush, had met his future wife, Ashley, who had worked as Personal Secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 democracies.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equality of votes and confirm his appointment as Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean exiles decreased at Kim
Since Kim Chen Eun came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean exiles in South Korea has decreased, and South Korean legislator has stated.
Pak Bong Seug, referring to data from the Southern Ministry, stated that, compared with the 2,706 escape cases recorded in 2011, this figure had dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers who exported people.
Peanuts don't make public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views the refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often makes them subject to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still in a state of war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yong in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, Foreign Minister Riy Yun Ho of North Korea accused the United States of its sanctions of impeding progress on this issue.
“If we do not have the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally”, said Mr. Ree in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavano "serious" and claims that he is not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi referred to Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, as “serious” and said that because of his temperament, he was not in a position to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment at the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Ossetia, Texas.
“I cannot help but think that if a woman had ever allowed herself to act in this way, she would have been called a ‘strike,’ ” says Pellasie of her reaction to Kavano’s testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Bleisi Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Cavanano acted emotionally enough, sometimes even bursting into screaming and suffocating about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the democrats of the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and well-planned murder of the current person”, organized by liberals, disputed by Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kavano had merely confirmed that she could not serve in the Supreme Court because she was biased against the democracies.
“I think he's disqualifying himself with his allegations, as well as the way he attacks the Clintons and the democracies,” she says.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to hold Kavano accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if the democracies received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he is not acceptable not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is now located,” Pelosie said.
Kavano is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about Kavano's possible decisions with regard to the Access to Health Care Act or Roo v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing on his candidature, Cavanano questioned whether he would annul some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It's not the time to let a man who issteristic and biased to serve as a supreme judge, but to say, ‘How wonderful!’ ” says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, and she can't go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry, ” Miss Stane told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was working somewhere in charge, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that explained to her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office, where men dominated me: one day I wept over violent anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a mindless manager, who I had always been scared of and dragged out on a ladder.
“Never let them see you cry, ” she told me.
"They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset and rejoice, thinking they've finally led you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some unserious affair and was released from the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she was not allowed to run for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out”, she confessed to me with a smile 30 years later.
“The race had already been attended by seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "The Whites and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign was already nearing its end, and it was seriously behind the fund-raising process, so it vowed not to participate in the race if it did not raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave 1,000 dollars to men, offered her only 250.
“What am I to them, a valued product or something? ” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not carry out a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment at a system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger because of gender discrimination that she suffocated.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Ms. Schrader about how the press responded to her.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering what would they write on my monument?
"She cried without end?"
How the trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first series of commercial wars between the United States and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, divisions between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, first warned earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected products worth $200 billion ($150 billion), essentially taxing half of all Chinese products entering the United States.
Beijing has had its equivalent backlashes every time, recently imposing a 60 billion dollar duty on American products between 5 and 10 per cent.
China promised that the response against the United States would be equivalent every time, and the second largest economy in the world was unlikely to begin to experience at least the slightest difficulty soon.
Making Washington retreat means giving up demands, but a public retreat from the United States would be too shameful for Ci Jinpin, president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing could play its maps correctly, the US trade war could provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to an economic collapse in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized observers,” says Abigail Grace, a research scientist at the New American Security Centre (Centre for New American Security), which specializes in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure as a result of counter-terrorism successes”, he said.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live in peace there.
All conditions were now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries that sponsored terrorism.
Europe takes over Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by winning the U.S. team from 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe has returned its crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who has won 14.5 points for his victory over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-lasting blow in the water on the 16th hole of steam three, retreating from his match of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming 1 in 4 players who had ever been on 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a five-four player with the lowest rating on the European team, Turbørn Olive from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, was replaced by 2:1 Ian Paulter of England, who may have participated in Reider's Cup for the last time.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, won a tournament in European history with 25.5 points for a career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold on today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all about teamwork, and I'm glad I was able to help, ” says emotional Garcia after European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rama, who won the American golf legend by Tiger Woods on Sunday, with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I am very proud of this victory — I grew up watching the game of Tiger Woods,” says 23-year-old Reem.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are rather strange for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles, only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. assembly fought throughout the weekend in vain to try to succeed, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the highest class golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Fürk said after his team spoke uncomfortablely, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to shake Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played great.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with PGA America and our Committee Ryder Cup, and we're going to move forward for success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've got to be good at losing.
We have lost.”
Red tide: The concentration of micro-organisms declined in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasot
The recent Florida Fish and Wild Nature Commission report reflects the overall decline in the red tide concentration in some parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasot, Charlotte and Koler, there is a decrease in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles [130 km] from the northern Pinelle to the southern districts of Li.
The points can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough, but their number has declined significantly compared with last week.
Red tide also occurs in Pasco District.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and near Pinellas district, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro coastal zone, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasot districts and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte district, high concentrations on the coast of Li district, and low concentration in Koler district.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasot, Lee and Koler, there is still a risk of irritability of airways.
No such probability was reported last week in north-west Florida.
