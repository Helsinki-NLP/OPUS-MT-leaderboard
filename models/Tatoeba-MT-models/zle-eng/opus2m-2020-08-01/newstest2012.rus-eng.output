Parliament does not support an amendment that gives freedom to Timoshenko.
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in its amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal an article condemning the leader of the opposition, Julius Timoshenko.
An amendment which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected at the time of the second reading of the bill on the mitigation of economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which had been found to be unserviceable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko's appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which had condemned the former Prime Minister, had been supported by 147 members of Parliament.
The ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
It's time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists are defeated; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the ordinary law of Shariata, which we have heard of.
Libya will become a country free of crime, as the penalty for theft is arm cut off.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a competitive clan society will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and is unlikely to wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best, and it is more likely that we will not be able to fit, for example, the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants accepted help from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, NATO was led, not by an American general, but by God, whose majesty they glorified after every blow.
And if you look for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We have participated in the fighting, served Islam, and our policies have been rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of benefit.
In view of recent unfortunate experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
There is no need for the local population to worry about the expulsion of the Kristonians.
Although, without occupation, would oil companies receive Libyan black gold for almost nothing?
Most likely they won't, and then the West will finally be able to run through the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Shariat put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now at the heart of investors.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have reported GDP data in the 3th quarter.
Compared with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, Germany and France are showing growth.
Still, the debt market is buffeting today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in the Czech Republic, Germany and some other countries have announced their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
The GDP of Germany increased by expected 0.5 per cent; France increased by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany had better cases than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information was expected to stagnate).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
On the basis of preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, both the eurozone and the European Union economies showed a 0.2 per cent increase over the previous quarter, which coincides with the forecasts of analysts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decrease of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year-old bonds have an income of 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the return of Czech 1-year-old bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech meets has been selected by the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won one:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully done the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the beautiful Czech and beautiful nude of Peter Jiracek, they won at 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was fortunate enough to retain a significant advantage after the home match and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the match and produced a detailed report.
It's almost nothing special in the first time and great luck in the second.
Czech national assembly, partly due to team defeat at the end; Great Czech; and heroic Yiracek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanović and Vuccičić became the most unfortunate couple of games after losing two great opportunities.
The great Peter Cheh is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly won't miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will earn about 200 million CZK.
From the first few minutes on, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulties with the combination; the game was spent most of the time in the centre of the field.
It also explains the absence of pressure from the master team in the first time, and the long-term attacks on the defence line were carefully interrogated by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a live shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, after the students prayed before entering the building, they prayed for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a live shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything indicated that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, both the U.S. and Israeli deaths were followed by prayers from students before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives will be, according to the Israeli press, the installation of uranium enrichment in both Isfahan and Natanz.
Eating of obese children: No breakfast or sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have higher standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent are obese.
According to a recent study, obesity - stricken children tend to come from unwholesome families.
Once again, we see the importance of environment and behaviours associated with man for his or her healthy development.
For example, bulbs appear almost twice as often on the tables of obese children as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of obese children ate fries for dinner the day before the educational event called Obesity was not an accident.
Moreover, the families of obese children do not engage in sports, but this is true of most families of modern school children - only 15 per cent of children said that their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of last school year, with nearly 900 elementary school students throughout Bohemia participating.
The Obesity event was not an accident for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Vscheo Cecaná zdravotní pojišāovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 school students in grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate sports load are key drivers of the rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of those interviewed said they were eating five meals a day, according to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and that's one of the basic conditions for proper nutrition," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as the family breakfast, are important to healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school children have breakfast together.
Most families have breakfasting separately.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family, people don't have breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the foundation of a good day's diet.
The study found that hot food is more common in families with obese children.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure falls to more than half, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Advances in food for Czech children aged between 12 and 15 are far from ideal for healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes large quantities of flour, meat and sweet food.
"It's particularly disturbing to see sweet cool drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main meal meal, the pasta won the bird with a small overhang.
However, children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetables.
The Struggle for a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children are prepared to change their eating habits on condition that they are provided with relevant information.
“Many of the participants in the monitoring group have demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after completing the Obesity lecture, which is not an accident”, the outcome of the project is stated.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks, with more children preferring just water.
In addition, children were more likely to notice birds and fish as the main dish, limiting the number of sweets and cakes.
Stilist must also be a good psychologist, according to professionals.
In the first article on style training, I visited the volume of information at my introductory sessions.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and seminar on how it works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we get to the final examination, the more information and practical assignments are expected.
Training goes on every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time, with Alainka, Director, (no man at all) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has no proper shape, and another weighs more than normal.
The Stilist needs to know how to visually reduce his broad shoulders, extend his neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize women such as Jennifer López, women with a thicker chest and thigh and a narrow waist, without putting them on too much.
For example, if the difference between the number of talya and the size of the thigh is so large that it is not possible to get a jacket or a pair of pants, it is worth at least one thing that is lined up for commission.
You will certainly not regret the investment, since the ideal clothing you sit is invaluable.
You're going to feel much better in your booking, you're going to feel much better than the one who's always moving, rolling, nakeding, etc.
The owners of the male figures may, on the other hand, wear clothing with rush, applishing, tying or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I am glad I have a whole week to realize.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, considering the homework we got.
Each participant had to come up with two suits for a celebrities, one for a day and one for a night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in their dress and the type of shape.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, whom you may know at Victoria's Security Advertising Campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered to a ton (please mean I'm exaggerating) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut clothes from magazines or find them online, print them and process them with graphic programs.
Mudboard -- what's called the result of work -- then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic image.
It's important to have a graphical forming style in your head.
Stilist not only wears real people but makes product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stoicist and designer Mario Kamennik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
A Stilist Needs General Knowledge
Saturday’s lecture, full of information on the types of figures, was reactivated by three specialist guests in this field.
Stilist, Honza Poconna; fashion designer, Jakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a styler must use this fact.
A good styler can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, coat-night can be worn in a regular way, on top of jeans and T-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without lockups, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll your sleeve or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"To play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I've most appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' said Jakub.
Here I finally figured out why we were toothbrushing all the definitions and rules that combined with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something very different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I found out that the scholasticist must have more options than the number of photographs he needs to take.
For example, for a 10-page fashion review (equivalent to ten) I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a way far different from the reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Poconna has confirmed that often image and style are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing viscosity, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of Stystists in the Czech Republic remains rather cold.
Even prominent people often think it's too much (and believe it's enough to be expert in something, or what they look like it's secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a smaller size than what they really are.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about some famous ceiling/blown, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed the lack of fashion management and the ability to pick up clothes.
Our work consists mainly of association with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them, nor to hold to their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look through her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire closet by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"You can find at least a few things you can praise and advise them that you can wear with them," Mario says.
He also showed us that a work bag should be specifically inserted.
It's a bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky stick or English pins, it must contain nylon thread (stipists use it in surveying certain items, such as bags or hats), special slips to attach tissue on the back if the clothes are too large (boots and similar items are prohibited because they wear clothing) or a sewing kit.
To get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned how to put on the soles of the shoe.
Even during the studios where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged -- let alone the street pictures.
And then we took care of the stick.
You don't have to touch shoes with scissors so you don't spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario commended my work.
The skills mentioned did not come to my mind.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional styler isn't as easy as talking.
V Need for Speed: The escape is taking place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to some extent, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the new version was released, high expectations were tied under the subheading “Flee”.
It was expected that it would launch the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the race-ging genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero came out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, there's a lot of difference between what we expected.
The game is a rather good arcade race, but the general impressions are a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's a manifestation of the unexplained laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are part of a story whose chief hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This design has some interesting features.
The route consists of 10 stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes along its own route, and the individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there is no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to look at some of the routes.
Yet, play does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, through autumn suburbs, or high in snowy mountains is a pleasure.
In addition, the race is periodically reviving an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you enter a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the bench.
Individual races are quite orderly.
There's only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to defeat a few rivals; then you're trying to improve time; or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you are occasionally confronted by the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just interactive animation where most of Jack's time is running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
It is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for play, because it's not a problem; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The race model follows previous models.
That means it's no longer something special, but it can't be considered a failure.
If you're looking for a real life simulation, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Yet, this model of driving is very appropriate for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far it's all very good.
But after a while problems arise.
Unlike driving models, collision models are not as good.
It's not a game of complicated transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea what you're going to do with an object, how your car is going to behave, something's wrong.
Usually when you drive or drive by cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch a different car slightly, but sometimes, in almost the same situation, your car starts to break apart.
Or the buckets were broken.
It's not important because of a restarting system, but it's enough to ruin fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you break or leave the highway far away, the game will bring you back to the point where it's interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you're using them all, you're going to have to start the race from the start.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn how to design a separate section of the race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to go through a certain way, or you will simply not fit in.
In other cases, you encounter civilian cars at a certain location in the same configuration, whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your rival moving between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you go there, the cars are already located so that you can either drive around or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; everything's arranged so things always happen right in front of your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During the game, you find a number of places where, no matter what time it is, the same rival will overtake you in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival should stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's coming in front of you, he's deteriorating your overview, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can think of an attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's rapidly starting to cause annoyance.
Too bad, because despite the simple driving model, the game is very interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't let you miss -- the concept of fifty unique tracks, the sequence of races, or something else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to track the gas station because it's where your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful U.S. cars are for direct cuts of highways; and exotic super-decks for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode mode is closely related to challenge mode; it is a race on individual sites that you will find out during the course of the game.
Here you win your own personal business, both medals and glasses common to challenges and stracy regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players and provides public relations.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car enter the subway tunnel (let's say you're) where you're running through the rails in the dark (let's say you are).
Your speedometer shows the figures from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say you are) when the subway train suddenly arrives behind you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our version has been discussing whether no one thought at the time of the game's creation, or whether its creators really think we're so daft.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the general impression of the video show is mostly pleasant, sometimes even shocking.
Although it is regrettable that in some critical moments the quality of the recording is sometimes quite high, it is declining.
This is especially true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where a good recording would not be of particular help to you.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the lover.
To please the widest possible audience of young people, the soundtrack's music came from different styles; but it is unlikely that many people will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The escape is rather disorderly.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that the escape is the best part of the NFS over the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's good fun, but get ready for the flaws to blind you as an airport searchlight.

Ambassador to the EU of Vicenova:
Czechs have a reputation for unfriendly and sceptics vis-à-vis the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has generated considerable differences among individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation even stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles”, EU Ambassador Milena Vitsinov firmly started his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She has proved to be following her motto “Sure and Open about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and relations between them so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the KU Law Department would be envied.
Moreover, Vicenova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"The critics said he was a regular grey office mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he managed his role."
“He is a person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries, communicates well with them and has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? By what number do I need to call?"; that is, as an important step towards the harmonization and transparency of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses.
The focus was further focused on the EU ' s past, present and near future programme.
She described Czech presidency as a success in the past year.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and organized an East Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic is currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have generated continued flogging.
It is also necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which countries would receive less; all those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: “Europeans, Understanding Language”.
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargons, which nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our varieties of cheese.'
It also intends to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-year Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-skeptics; as well as people who point to negative rather than positive aspects of things.
She wanted more Czechs to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that there are several factors behind this: the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we are joined by a dictionary, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what about the meeting, again the Visegrad Group?" And he's not happy about it."
In the future, the Vicenova Union is awaiting largely new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
In comparison with the new European Federation, it considered the idea to be two-speed, if not multi-year Europe, more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Shengen zone, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that want to join together, while those who do not want to stand aside."
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be truly two-speed Europe”, Waits for Visinov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not only those in the eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM's innovator comes into his second century of existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longitude was laid by her first boss, Thomas J. Watson's dreamer.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumai!" thus became a stamp surrounding the life of the future giant (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB started publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"To us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement for the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says the current director of Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of the care of employees just as Bata in the Czech Republic was one of the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is equally advanced.
It was one of the first world companies to eliminate all of the discrimination that gave it a great choice.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy and current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has been employed by IBM for thirty years; she is now a director of sales, marketing and development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, with many future innovations.
Not surprisingly, many ideas are working in a company around half a million people.
A well-revealed organization
A firm ' s strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, from the point of view of IBM, it was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of IBM Rasabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve the problems of technology-based business," adds Jodge Kolni of Forester Research, a consulting company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between entering and creating the market.
In a hundred years, IBM, or Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company - the hardware and software development company; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a bank account, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With 220 billion dollars, market capitalization data indicate that IBM was the second largest technology company this year (the first place for Apple) to overtake Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products were good for customers and fit into the era, for example, IBM failed with its OS/2, Prodigy's online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven by the movement forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easy to build on a few platforms -- if they don't work, it refuses them.
This differs, for example, from its competitor, Microsoft, which is based and is experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Promising technology
The main revenue of IBM comes from services, about one fifth of which comes from computer software and hardware in each case.
While it was twice as small in 1990, it was the strongest manufacturing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since early 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by a record 120 per cent; the company ' s net earnings have been steadily rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything except your own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history: From crude knife to space missions.
IBM (International Business Science) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original title was "Coordination, Tabulation, Record" was quite complicated.
It was called IBM in 1924, and it was originally called a brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The bases for future IBM were laid down by the merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies, such as legendary "good watch" -- hours that record time when staff members come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman named Charles Ranlet Flint, who also led the company’s Board of Trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competitor company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The manager then sent the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis for an unbounded corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the name, started with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from crude knives and meats to cashiers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the proceeds doubled to $9 million, and a large-scale expansion of the company across all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both the staff and the IBM computers helped NASA control space missions -- Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 -- human flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, IBM line System360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to a Chinese company, Lenovo, while at the same time purchasing a PricewaterhouseCoopers office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
IBM has made great progress over the past three years with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve road and urban management.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented a smarter business platform that helps businesses control the entire business cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be in central and eastern Europe at the same time, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and eastern European headquarters is located in Prague, where a world-class research group on speech recognition is also operating.
Rehoboam about his unbelieving husband:
Yveta, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richarzewov (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Rikhtarz (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darwin was still hoping that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarzewov.
When Darina Richarzew was given Bartosov’s blood in her house during the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Eweto to leave Rzychan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted to his love for her.
After a while, Darina gave up pretending she had made up her mind with her husband's novel; and now she's finally forgiven him.
I don't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if one day Richtarge and Bartoshov separate, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out."
"However, he will end his days, not like my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I'm tied up," said Rikharzewov, adding that she's already freed from her husband and insists only on two things.
As long as Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect this decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I'm responsible for repairs, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, except we don't divide the bed anymore," said Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rikhtarzov finds new love, he will not interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with and whether she's got a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivet and I'm completely responsible," concluded Joseph.
The worst women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some of the bad habits of women, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Schoping
Your other half complains you're always shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping might be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they have to control their interest in shopping.
Yet, who of you will refuse to walk around clothing shops in search of perfect seated clothing and example (optionally in various color versions) in some examples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it could be a hell of hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five kilograms-- maybe I should start making gymnasium."
"Are you still bringing me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are involved in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have allergies for constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints are made, the more women get angry with them.
The Most Important of All Orders and Cleanse
It's like an endless story.
The washing of glass, the cleaning of vacuum cleaners, the cleaning of floors, the fighting dust, the cleaning of baths -- at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on a clean pot in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink; and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this “divorce, ” try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not be at the top of your life.
An unselfish desire for cleanness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Attempt to command
"Cast your clothes in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty noses tomorrow?"
"The towels of vessels shall not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your mate several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Spooky
Some women like to gossip, insult, and scheme against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, where, and why.
From time to time, I guess each of us's letting go of gossip.
We're going to be frank, and this seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others, especially in the women's work force, who pose a great threat to their environment.
The final transmissions of Jagra and Vorechek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transmissions of hockey attacker Jaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on ice Carolina, and he again became the most effective Czech player in the game.
In both cases Claude Giro used the experience of a 30 - year - old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best match player.
Two of the results of the match were also part of the same team with Yagro Jakoub Voreček.
After the Jagra match, he told foreign journalists that he had predicted a wonderful evening for Jirah.
"I told him before the match that he would kill a hit-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometime you feel these things," Jagr explained, after whose actions Gir was hit by a needle at first opportunity given by Fleyers.
A little later on, the team's second leg also had a "cash trail".
Locked by Harricines Vorecek, he took over a carnivore and handed it over to Maxima Talbot, who was killed between the circles.
One second before the first break, Patrick Dyer, a home player, narrowed the gap with a lot of advantage, but at the beginning of the second time, Flayers was brought back.
Especially Jiro.
After the successful delivery of the Yigra, he scored a third goal; in the future, his strike was turned into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he is the best league player, but he's definitely entering into the three best," said Yagro, commending his centre.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NlC, my teammates have tried to help me, and now it's my turn," Jagra added.
Carolyn made the match more dramatic with Tumo Ruut and the Dyer Toolbar, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were averted by Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
"Prenger did great in our area."
"He hit the sash, I accelerated, and Reid went to the far side."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," Warrke described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory took Philadelphia first place in the Eastern Conference.
The Protector of the Montreal Czech Yaroslav Spakek team did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to the injury of the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender of Canada, they lost their two-way advantage and lost 2:3 after the series.
Tomasz Plekansky was unable to kill in one of their attacks.
More than the lost glasses, the house coach was upset by the high number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added counsel, P.K. Soubban.
After 30 attacks, the Czech Hulper Onjay Pavelcist helped Winnipeg defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The halls of Jets, who interrupted a five-part series of injuries, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourist agencies had been able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: ʼedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely limited, the tourist agencies of the time were mainly selling tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
The Czech tourists were thus on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was between 1962 and 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which placed considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to travel on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; otherwise, no individual travel was possible.
At that time, tourist agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that was not all.
The currency permit was needed to travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically insecure people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; without monetary authorization it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West.
The Czechs were most likely to spend their vacations at home, resulting in large numbers of cottages and summer homes, and this practice has been maintained to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While prior to 1989, GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that before 1989, we were unable to visit freely the most popular Croatia today, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries in Western Europe had been lifted, resulting in a huge wave of short journeys mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not have been filled with travels to the West, everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tents in parks because their income at the time was not sufficient for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring food of one ' s own (conservatives, salts, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech kroner, and decades later our tourists are finally free to purchase Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have increased, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines; compared with the past, flights are now incredibly cheap because of the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs didn't need a visa to visit almost all the developed worlds except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of travel since the revolution occurred in 2000, and demand led to a historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, sending 12 exotic flights from the Czech Republic during the winter.
At present, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important development of this period, which symbolizes our development since the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. lifted the need for a visa for Czech tourists, thus becoming a permanent member of the world's most advanced countries.
For the first time in the history of 2008, Czechs had spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they had spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during vacations abroad, including expenses at their destination.
The General Assembly has to choose the President, the Pat's threat returns.
For about five months, the Czech football has not had a president, and there is a risk that the successor Ivan Gachek, head of the Czech football association (FAāR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without this vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindrji Raichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Pazlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, Gacheka ' s era has once again loaded football into a gap between the two chambers of association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when it was necessary to elect a new president.
General Assembly delegates had come to the National House in Prague, Smikh because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral process.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in a general meeting - only legal representatives or officials who had been granted authority.
This has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights that a representation based on the powers granted cannot be established.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been too helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly concerned with this matter.
Representations on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed to the third round and avoid sweating?
"The dispute is whether to follow established standards or find another model," says one of the Vice-Presidents of FAāR Duchana Liberty, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received greater support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree on a compromise to consider a candidate as the winner of the election, with the largest number of votes cast in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the overall percentage ratio, the winner should obtain at least two thirds of the vote.
“At least two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have totally rejected the concept of the two Chambers”, freedom agreed with Moravia’s arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
A few surprises Tomas Pazlik agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that the electoral rules defined by the statute are more suitable for Pelta than for other candidates.
"I wish that the elections should be held as much as possible by statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representational stupidity, as in the previous general meeting," says Victoria Plzehn, the owner of the candidate for the first time; and in his remarks he was essentially contradicting Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that in future candidates would cooperate constructively.
"All emotional fervor will calm down after today's national meeting at the European Championship."
“Futball will be back on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate”, said the representative of Jablant, and of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more self-restraint.
"I look forward to an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It could cause another breakdown of the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," said Rachel.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be carried, among others, by Vice-Presidents Dalibir Kucher and Rychla to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure, and an alternative was found to bring part of the executive committee to the place where the game match was held.
After all, the ministerial meeting, which is expected to take place on Wednesday, can become decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would like the opposing parties of the country ' s strongest sports association to reach agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football credit; and a planned general meeting of the ✔STV, with a new management of Czech sports following Sazki's financial problems.
Paclik is in the presidential struggle because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, prior to an extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football team, Plzen Tomash Pazlik, could see a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA!R), he would not even claim a high office.
"If I had been a worthy candidate, I would have fought for him and not been involved in the struggle myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Pazlik .TK.
Motivated by Pazlika to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rychl, to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favour of the election, from entering into the FAāR administration.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that if won, he will remain President only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager who is not too connected to football life.
"I've spoken to a few people who could be remembered."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I should like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, Patzlika's main difference with Pelta is linked to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Plzen, and Berbre is a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyer who can influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Pazlik thus considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Pazlik.
He suggests that a few years ago the name Pelta was recorded while listening to telephones in an investigation into the corruption case; Pelte managed to avoid sentencing.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would have been for football."
"And as we would have looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik, "he doesn't mention his earlier statement that he would "sold the Plzeng club if Pelta became president."
If Pazlik wins Thursday, he could represent cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Rachl, who was supported by Pazlik before the general meeting in September, which ended in fiasco.
"He would be the first to whom I would turn."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it at the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
'I don't have a nose in what I don't understand either,' said Pazlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of a judicial crew led by Louis Matsela, who was replaced by Dogmar Domkov.
Paclik claims he's gonna run an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; he has since last summer managed the Plzeun team, which celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for better."
“Restricting the influence of certain groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to disgusting situations”, said Pazlik, who does not hide his antipathy, such as Daniel Krzetinski, Director of Sparta.
One of its priorities will be the strengthening of the relationship between FAāR and the Czech Olympic Committee, whose help it will use to lobby at the highest political level more money for lottery sports.
"This is one of the key points that the new president has to deal with."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must make clear where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeun Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAāR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to an apple, and Rachel's connected to Prague's Duke.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see any point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to the Plzeung club to someone else, because I'm going to go back there in six months," says Pazlik.
Pelta promised new FAāR rules that would prevent the elected Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for new FAāR rules to avoid disputes over the rules of election in the future.
Prior to the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, the apple player remains optimistic and believes that the focus on the pre-election struggle will significantly distract today's expected success of our football assembly.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting, and a two-month delay could thus be useful to him to support his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been on football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it is now time for someone to lead an association," claims a person who is mainly associated with the Applenets Club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gachek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"Had it not been for the different modes of representation, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He referred to the copying of the key document of the civil association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I'm going to consider it my personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to stand out in front of rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrich Rychl, whom he valued for his legal education; he was fully aware that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pazlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been on football for over a year and he's made some progress."
"Whatever the case, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign."
“And therefore some of them are now questioning his true identity,” Pelta said about his competitor, and Pelta himself claims to be true to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapons to be the knowledge of football, from the lowest to the national gathering.
The national assembly should represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the gods or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"Just after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for the entire football," the 40-year-old candidate said ?TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'll need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." This was his message to Fear, where the prolonged period of inter-power causes a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that delegates would come to Nimburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Futball needs the trust it can gain by finally choosing its leader," says Pelta, who two days before the key day of his career remains an optimist.
Rachel promises that his guide, FAāR, will be active.
If, at the meeting on Thursday, Jindrji Rachl, the Vice President-in-Office, becomes president of the Czech football Association, many people in the Association are told to be unhappy.
Rachel promises that if he is elected, there will be a time of hard work.
He wished to introduce changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the gods; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gachek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national gathering, professional football and football events for young people”.
"I don't mean to say I'm going to do everything myself," said Rachel in his interview for ?TK.
"I'm a command player, and I want to share the powers of the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I'm putting things to good use so that in each of these segments, football can take a big step forward."
"It's probably not going to be like many people because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The climate of criticism of the football movement allegedly caused him to question his candidature.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any point in it; and that I won't be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained.
"Not least, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done over the last two years, and I don't want to cancel it."
"There were processes that could produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association might return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelta's competent is unlikely to be."
"He's surrounded by people who do football so that it's available only to the chosen."
"I can be accused of a lot, but certainly not of subjectiveity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he refutes the charges that he will be the only President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to argue otherwise, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and the moral parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the present situation when there are only three Marine teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While the club manager Plzeni Tomas Pazlik fought the President, Rachel would not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Well, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Rachel.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in association.
Affirming that Pelta was “excluded from the loaning process of Czech football”, he considers another rival, Pazlika, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job on Plzen this year."
"If they choose him, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant changes in committee staffing."
"He wouldn't have distorted the facts for his own benefit," said Rachel about his rival.
Europe ' s most beautiful basins
Jump in the Water
Julia Stanec
Child basins with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest, travelers can test Europe's incredible water and relax the raised body in the jacuzze after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Iris Meder was unable to do without one thing during his research tours for the past year and a half: without his buying suit.
She was lying on her back in the water, looking up with a taste of painted domes, swimming for marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and being loved by carefully restored swimming pools in the manner of Ar-veo.
She was in a hurry to add every attractive pool to her notebook, with important details of the construction and history of the building.
The architect of the architecture of Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools -- and now collected impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, which included everything from public basins in Munich to historic bath palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the baths in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
A 46-year-old author is a truly buying enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only flaw is that navigationists must put up with the blue coffee tiles and the scent of chlorine, while runners can breathe the enticing smell of the soft forest or listen to the happy chirping of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The swimming in the pool and the fossil oil in the sauna is a healthy factor in the baths, because Meder believes that all emotions are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for your eyes if the builders take on such work.
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, color tile, and tramplins.
An illustrated publication, The Luxury of Bathing, on 190 pages, provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasis, and makes you want to jump into the water.
The water collector Meder discovered several outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in a cartel cave (the Moscow-Tapolze cave) and a thermal bath filled with bilge water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberen), as well as beautiful therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old baths of Sécheni in Budapest.
Of the many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, there is an amazing view, and you can see all of Zurich from the pool on the roof or see Arlberg's snowy open pool in St. Anthony, and there's a steam window that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits the merchants in Langenfeld, and the Aqua assembly in Etztal looks like UFO, just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open seashells rise from it, which appears to be very small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The Meder basin lady didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray, and Arpada's baths in Bekeshchab smell so much oil that you may find it hard to believe that you're in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water, and the water is almost black from a needle that sticks to the skin as soon as you sink into the pool - a certain type of health experience.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful baths, and when she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Lugachovics, she discovered that the territory was sealed.
The domes designed by architect Duchan Jurkovich in 1902 were closed down.
When Merder looked into the visible windows of the red-white-yellow building in the style of Ar-veo, she saw the weeds growing between the coffee tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on a hot trail is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Warzwald Palace of thermal waters in Bad Wildbad.
The basses have already passed three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-Roman elements since the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Alhambra Hall, added around 1900.
After extensive reconstruction in 1995, the Atmonal Palace, a favorite swimming pool at Iris Meder Basins, was not just because it was from Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement -- it's so adept at combining such different architectural structures," says Meder.
Getting into a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary occupation.
Stimulating agricultural products
The Deutsche Bank investigates agricultural trade.
Christian Tives
Will Deutsche stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann commissioned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculation on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents required that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbated the problems faced by the world's poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study by Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of Foodwatch Consumers.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Shuman, shows that the world merchandise exchange is raising prices, and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
Consumers' campaigns are directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley, are also traded.
Initially, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand and are profiting from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that “no trade is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results are presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can decline or cease at all.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude toward the financial sector.
As the bank's top lobist, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, in Bode's view.
"The Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments that make money on food prices," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter whether it's about hungry people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The quick response of Akkermann is surprising at first, but the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before he ends his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President would not move to the monitoring board as planned.
The removal of controversial speculation on the food market could improve the image of food products.
Nor did he have to care for the costs; his successor would have to deal with the consequences.
Each other would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bodé published a study on Tuesday: the study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that place food prices at a rate are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, and 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century home in Vienna
Paulion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsowski
Architectural history of take-offs, fall-outs and happy endings: Paville of Austria won prizes, became a museum in Vienna for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, empty and abandoned.
Now it's re-opened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, bold in expressing belief in technological progress.
Pavilion Schwanzer won the Gran in 1958 for his light steaming structure of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, he became known throughout the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylindrical BMW tower and her sister, a building in the form of a cup.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss garden near the South Station of Vienna, was transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962, and is often referred to as “The House of the 20th Century” for that reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang works of art and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and it was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishhanitz has now restored the pavilion, called the House of the 21st Century, and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all sense a happy event.
Agnes Husslain-Arco, who became new director of the Austria Gallery of Belveder in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslayin Arco, graduate of the Department of Arts with a brilliant career as a figureess in youth, who worked at Sotheby's museum, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Strasbourg, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue to rebuild, attract public funds and private donations, and decide how the building would be used.
The new museum was to house a permanent exhibit of the Fritz Otrub Foundation, the coffee shop and the bookshop along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict & restricted budget control
Krishhanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Cecion Joseph Olbrich and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was a “extently important place” where he attended the exhibition “at least every week”.
He knew the original design and the tasks that lay ahead of the building, a building that had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and converted.
The problems of the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was "energy absorber," Kryshanitz says.
The window panes on the glass facade were replaced, the reinforced glass panes were inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high safety glass.
The steel interpretations of the heat bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created a space for the new use of the building, and a falling light well between the building and the street provides light -- an almost new building, but still a beautiful pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original outer doors were preserved and the building was painted in an old red brown colour of protection against corrosion.
Hall movie theater is the same as it used to be.
All of this with strict monitoring of museum management and a limited budget.
"We've often found material that was good, cheap and approved by the Museum Office," says Krishanitz, pointing to the unequal raffle in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Krishhanitz recently noticed that the "Brussel" pavilion was a rough story -- a typical story of the "capleys in the City."
This architecture is "always out of place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st century's house is in the very right place, because when planning the city, there was unexpected luck, and the fully restructured main station quartz with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss garden.
A second happy event may occur: The 21st century house can be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz, collector Francesca von Gabsburg, who acquired the Berlin Exhibition and is reportedly negotiating with the city next to him in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the removal of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
The newspaper reports that Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter and late trains.
Referring to the domestic crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, Bild reports that investments totalling about Euro300 million are planned until 2015.
Investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff on their own and engaged in cleaning snow from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear platforms from snow and ice to work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and delaying trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
The past winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as she lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains had been awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check ICE train axes much more frequently for years after one ICE train broke down at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many millions of pounds in the United States
The new troubles followed the unrest around Joseph Akkermann, Director General of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine of many millions of pounds in the United States.
Like Deutsche, the Bank had little trouble in its homeland, and the past of the U.S. industrial giant was now driving him, and Deutsche, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm the disputes arising from the bankruptcy of the five major credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
“We are pleased to have solved this problem without the parties going to court”, said representative Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not confess guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA), is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for the billions of losses.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The doubtful mortgage bonds are the so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This was determined by the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 the U.S. real estate bubble burst.
The American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered a long life in September 2008 on the ridge of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have put forward a large number of claims for compensation or fraud.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having acquired some $200 billion bond agreements from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of FHFA prosecution for numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for “material losses”, but does not yet specify the exact amount.
Doyce Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffett's financial guru is investing actively in IBM IT.
Since March, he has bought shares totalling more than ten billion dollars.
To date, Warren Buffett, the largest American investor, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view on investment in this industry.
According to Buffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was considered a knight’s act.
IBM, IT industry veteran, now you get the title "sir IBM."
In an interview with an American business television channel, CNBC Buffet reported that since March he had acquired IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding of Burkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest holders of IBM shares with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He commended the management that had been able to obtain profits even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
IBM has long focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
Buffett was still avoiding technology companies.
He claimed he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, lubricants and machinery.
His holding of Burkshire Hathaway owns shares in the long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of his own subsidiary companies.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Burkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies by means of skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making it a cult for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct for money brought him the nickname Omaha Oracle.
The price of IBM shares increased by one percent before opening markets after Buffett's investment was announced.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, stands on a stock exchange of over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
An Inevitable Risk
After the identification of the Tswickau Egg, the Turkish media began to question the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of “blood ideology”, which is now rising again on the surface.
The killing of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of a right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears, and there have been no such right-wing attacks on the Turks since the fires in Mellin in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing network that has now been discovered has a scale that is not fully understood.
"Resurrection of bloody ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a covert keeper of secret services and is concerned that German authorities may be drawn into the extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly to the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Berlin Turkish Community celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the employment of the labour force at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Education in some Turkish media was like a crack. "The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriet also didn't miss this parallel.
"It smells bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had been killed had made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and subsequent successful raids were severely criticized in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought of monitoring suspected persons in the right-wing circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric: “If they continue to act equally ill, migrants will have no choice other than armed self-defence.”
"This will be the best self-defence."
"The peace of Germany depends very much on how the entire network is revealed and on the rightness of punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the world in Germany under threat.
Photographs of burnt ruins in Zolingen were deeply impressed by the Germans and Turks ’ memory.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks living here that they are in danger and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do Not Repeat the Errors of the Past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the German police’s failures following the attacks, and Helmut Kol refused to visit survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram to the President of Turkey after the fire in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech, counting the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
As if he had determined the value of a man by taxes that he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again revealed how the lack of confidence of many German Turks in the current German State has since increased.
Clearly, what needs to be done now is, in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on Zurich Lake
Most of the major risky policies of European banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went through a financial crisis, and since then it has been struggling with one and the other.
Now it's German to get him back on course.
Alex Weber certainly didn't know he'd get this role.
In July, after his effective resignation from the Head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013, he would begin to serve as an equally effective President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, commended Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength and made several friendly comments to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Phillip and Oswald Grewbel."
But it was already September that it was clear that things would be different.
The UBS traders in London have bypassed the bank security systems and lost about Euro1.7 billion.
The Executive Director of UBS, Oswald Grublü, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber is required to advise the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, he will assume the presidency of the Board in May rather than 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will no doubt need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had earned the title “the greatest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, it managed the largest assets in the world -- and on the other, it doesn't get out of scandals for years.
The proud Swiss bank seems to spare nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Up until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The Bank linked the image of a hidden and sustainable but, at the same time, a fish manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus managing more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank entered into the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has long taught at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains, "I have always cited my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In mid-year, Peter Wuffley, the executive director, who was considered to be an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly resigned.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he was gone.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play substandard securities and had to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors -- but investors whose services many bankers have recently been politely abandoned -- one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden so much that it has not even been named.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, and the President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, second-rate director of the Swiss Board of Directors in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster struck, and due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was threatened with collapse, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank had purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation had paid six billion Swiss francs for convertible and mandatory conversion bonds to become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of huge banks being established in a small country.
After all, the total balance of UBS in 2007 was five times higher than the total production of Switzerland (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS filed a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to pass on data from wealthy customers who might have left taxes with the aid of a bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustifiable business revenues plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a tool to avoid taxes.
At the same time, UBS lost what it had always been his advantage in fighting for wealthy customers, a veil of secrecy.
After that, the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money started coming out.
Within a few months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main activities - investment due to poor speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the promotion of tax avoidance.
And it only calmed down and it seemed as if UBS had managed to break the situation, how this hits a hit-and-pocket, and the one-one trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment division is not working yet.
“The incident with Adolfi clearly showed that risk control has not changed sufficiently”, says Martin Jensen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also doubts: “UBS has no risk control tool”.
It was caution that for a long time Swiss bankers kept the world's largest assets at risk, but security for money, whether peace fell outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank safes became a symbol of irrevocable reliability, as Lindt and Springli symbolize subtle chocolate taste.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the image of a decent Swiss private bank - only a little more.
Her location is in itself a classic.
The bank's main office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrassa, which leads from the main station directly to the Lake of Zurich, surrounded by snow caps in Swiss mountains.
The buildings are luxuriant, and the lease rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores like Confisery Spüngli are jewellery firms like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Palace of Credy Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Bair.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather couches, next to the bank emblem of the big Safe.
UBS knows what customers need is reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, abandoned the Swiss notions of a banking case, or, according to a head of a small Swiss bank, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper -- like all Swiss bankers -- he's also working with two of the largest banks.
He believes UBS has become too large, particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxes are very active.
In his view, there was nothing to add here to the Swiss.
"And if there is anything, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits -- and then the faasco -- that none of Europe's other financial institutions lost so much money in the jungles of substandard assets like the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“In that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hassig in his book The Krah UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have been?
If asked by Swiss banks, they would say that the problem was mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank had been set up, which was too large for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and it continued to grow.
The two banks that formed UBS complemented each other; one was a rich but advanced bank specialized in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more international.
Internationalized investment banks suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to twist an all-powerful wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfffley, Executive Director of UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Oppel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and in-depth understanding of models and statistics, and Oppel with his internal instinct, which has passed all the way up from the intern to the bank."
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolffley.
And Wolfffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officials remember well the meetings of members of the board, at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to push Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he led the “Turnier Table”, where bank success was achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this path.
UBS was the largest trading player in currency and government securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot, according to the parameters referred to in the banking terminology as “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS entered a adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its based hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that linked securities based on American mortgage loans and sold them further, continuing to carry risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to get the bank out of order were more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts in UBS have become children's chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
Any head of this huge bank has almost impossible tasks to do.
He's got to find a strategy for a bank that turned its back on all existing business models.
The Geiger banking analyst already has an idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go so far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be substantially reduced.
The new bank head, Sergio Emotty, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
In fact, a 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was only considered a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grewbel.
Since then, he has been able to demonstrate his character and, as the Canary Bank stated on Tuesday, is now leading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernesti plans to return the investment bank to its position in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that's not going to be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to earn money?
These are questions that Axl Weber must have asked himself.
He still said publicly only that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.

Pretentious ravens fill cities
The play is considered troublebirds in many places, experts say today that these highly intelligent birds will not be able to be expelled from cities.
Some like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and crows have been part of urban landscapes for centuries, but residents who complain about mud and noise are growing in many human settlements.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium on crows, in Lehr, East Frisia, experts argued that players could no longer be expelled from cities.
Professionals from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that urban migration was rooted in specially protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees made it difficult for birds to survive.
The crows are under protection.
The town of Zest in Westphalia and north-west in Yewer, Dipholc, Achim under Bremen and Lera has large colonies of over 600 parents.
A controversial project to shoot the crows in Lera led to bad newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described bird fishing and beatings as special cruelty.
"No ordinary movement and relaxation." said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lear.
The cutting down of a nest of water or tree scrap often has undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert, Manfred Kaiser, of Lar, Baden-Würtemberg.
"Living colonies are scattered and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas."
Recreation is possible only in the form of exceptions to hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them and get rid of them is not an option."
In the distance from the surrounding areas, there will be no solution to the problem in the cities,” says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of preventing birds from being protected by residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of chainsaw" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ecologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who is in favour of a completely different approach to birds. "We have to be sure to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig Holstein, where information about the lives of highly deliberate players is provided on information stands.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on complaints of bird noise.
The mind and laughter of these birds have entered legends, not only have games used tools to get a piece, but they also make tools themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested a bird’s mind on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to knock on a board to get a mole of larvae.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to shoot down the board.
In another experiment, artisans had to solve a more complex task.
The researchers put a small gauze with a mole of larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the prey with a glue.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used a wire to make hooks and hooks to hold the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have been able to handle this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo leads Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosniacs and Turks for victory in the last minute were not met.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.

Following the European Vice-Cepione break, four more fencings were added to the 2004 bill.
Peter Yiracek cleared all the remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
European championships are sent to European championships for the fifth consecutive time.

The 9th minute enemy Peter Cheh, thanks to an instantaneous reflexe, prevented a potential car tow Tomash Siwok.
Montenegro had the best chance when there was Stevan Yvetic and Dejan Damyanović duet in the field.
The 40th minute Damyanović struck from the edge of the jail and nearly killed a goal of the Czech.
After a break, the trouser saved the world-class chha glitch after the forwards of FK Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was just before the final whistle.

The Turks were almost able to begin off in front of 31,000 visitors at the Maximir Stadium.
The next blow, Seljuk Inan, got in the back at seven minutes, and the attacker Kazim failed to hit the ball in the net.
Croatia has since woke up and taken control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued to play in excellent shape.
The Legionaries of Bundesilgi Daniel Pranić (Bawaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aynthrath, Frankfurt) were in the field with Mario Manjukić of the Wolfsburg team, who replaced Ivan Perišić from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
The repatonies go to Euro 2012

Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team compared the score to 57 minutes.
Ireland has taken a good start from the beginning, but it's only at 23 minutes that Robbie Keen from L.A. made the first pure nude blow.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender was able to prevent Ireland from moving forward.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its workers in China over the next few years.
The company entering Dax reported on Thursday that it was about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) to invest by 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people," said Bill McDermottt, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A state of 2,500 people should grow to 4,500.
The world market leader for industrial software plans to double the number of his offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Dalian.
There are about 4,000 SAP clients from more than 176,000 around the world in this country, which is experiencing the economic boom.

Mass killings - the human dimension
The intense and very good new book by Peter England, "The Beauty and Grief: Personal History of the First World War", begins with a long list of actors from which the heart dies.
Here is how you can read the following: Carefully select this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very close as Mr. England reports, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your lighthouse at a time when, like one of these men and women, you will fall off the road and lose yourself in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund - Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote right now is unusual, he describes it, rather as "an anti-history work."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are few ambassadors, ensnaring journalists or discussions of tactics and warfare techniques.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, "How many books about what it looked like," it's about "feelings, impressions, emotions and the state of the spirit."
The book Beauty and Grief combined the experiences of 20 more or less invisibly men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and bottlers to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone is going to fall into captivity, lose a hand or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives die like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some are extinguished at that time.
Mr. England's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the assumption that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
Beauty and grief are effective in providing the panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bees; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the problem is tsetse flies.
It's a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which smells like smokeless dust.
When the canonade is around, and you're a woman and you're home with the kids, will you stay in place or run?
Anyway, who's that coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war.
“A lack of facts”, notes Mr. England, “renewed by speculations, speculations, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours”.
The beauty and sorrow is the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other published material.
The stories about their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to the minor moments and the tear-off details gathered by Mr. England.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere erzac."
"Replacement, counterfeit aluminium, non-continuous rubber, paper tendons, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about an erzac meal in Germany.
He describes “the meat of the meat of the meats of which is cooked in the ram of fat; the tobacco of dried roots and dried potatoes; and the shoes of which are broken with wood.”
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American notices the urge for cruelty and says of war, "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening paper or bestseller, and to claim that this display is a civilization and that there is no barbarous under your tacked shirt."
On the contrary, a British soldier notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person comes to terms with self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen to the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's pretty much like "a convicted man who's hanged in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become increasingly economic competition," Mr. England writes, "the war factories."
He notices the arrival of someone who calls himself "a new species in the batiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass killer in a well-cuffed suit that sets up a slaughter sitting at a writing table."
People act in an unexpected way: low-level acts are as much like heroism.
Mr. Englund described the soldiers who had tried their best to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
"The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea which soldiers bought and grafted at their disposal in hopes of getting into the hospital," he writes.
"All those who despaired were putting him in their eyes, which often led to life's blindness."
Mr. England's prose, translated with Swedish Peter Graves, is flexible but non-weaponic, perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war “freed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as the Great War and Modern Memory, Paul Fassel, or novels such as "In the Western Front without change" erikha Maria Remarca, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. England's book is part of this unscalable pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final I can remember in non-favourable literature.
I won't tell him.
But it was as if he had reached a page with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hands and burned it with a match.
After the previous error, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there was to be fewer people in Zukotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said that they were on their way to the exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of events, and his presence highlighted the importance attached to the operation by the Police Department.
There could be no question of the recurrence of episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of list gas against protestors, which contradicted the rules of the Department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to free the Zukotti Park protestors.
The authorities were preparing themselves to observe occupation in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randels Island with an estimated Zukotti.
The authorities increased the number of so-called riot exercises - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter the park came at “the last minute”, a source familiar with orders that referred only to the assignment as “the practice”.
"The few cops I know and called to this case didn't say they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who was talking under the conditions of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest office in the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they retreated before hundreds of protesters who had been in front of the appointed deadline, having heard of those plans.
The operations involved various police units, including the force from the districts, police teams, who were usually used to control criminal areas around them.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, came and left the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night a good time to attack.
"It was right to do so when there was less people in the park," he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike Slap and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spectators and the recorded announcements of loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protestors.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving the protestors time to collect the items.
Other police teams, according to witnesses, met at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police functioned and that police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Brown said that TV cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could film a picture.
When the police passed west through a pile of personal belongings of protestors, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, complete clothes, the health department teams followed her, collecting what had been abandoned.
Some of the protestors who refused to leave were taken outside, and the photos soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took positions near camp kitchens, at the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter were putting themselves together.
And two people were chaining themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue officers were summoned to cut down the locks.
No arrests were held in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, reported to the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for “infractions of public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
The highest officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, Head of Department and Senior Officer in the Department.
Phil. T. Pulacki, head of the department's investigative police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not lead the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sydar Street, in case they had to get inside.
The barriers were placed on Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and on Pine Street, a quarter south.
Observers saw police expanding the perimeter from these positions even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, evicting people further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protestors jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others were said to have released air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew from the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The school service staff union will sue the city for dismissal
A trade union representing hundreds of school service staff who lost their places last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor pupils were enrolled.
Judicial proceedings are probably the last resort available to a union of the District Council of 37 seeking to abolish dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as trade union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to allow the city to have access to health funds managed by groups of workers to close a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this charge.
At last month's hearings on the City Council, Dennis M. Waltkot School Chancellor said that dismissal was part of the budget they signed last June.
One of the Board members steamed by telling him that nowhere in the budget had there been any indication that school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claims, warning the Department of Education that a complaint had been brought against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to declare a formal submission to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be identified as defendants, and eight staff members who have been dismissed as plaintiffs will be listed, all of whom are black or Latin American women, as do most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronicly underfunded.
He points out that while there were few dismissals in Staten Island and there were few in higher East Sayd or Tribeki schools, 17 school assistants lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in County 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants in 36 free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “It is not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget failures”.
P.S. The budget for the 36th was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed its way of calculating additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The Trade Union also asserts that the school principals may have been misled by a notification language allowing the dismissal of the contact points with the parents.
The notice used the word “exceed” although the word “exceed” was more often used when a teacher from the school's pay card moved to the list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six work coordinators were dismissed," says the draft claim, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress ready for Libya agreement
It seems that the Republicans and democracies on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the Libyan rebellion.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, the ancient dictator Muammar al-Qadhafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCayin (Republicr, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for the good rebellion and the United States troops for “for their courage”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to honor the courageous people of Libya when they are beginning to rebuild their country”, Carey said.
“This is a confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no other debate on Libya has taken place easily.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the language of a series of resolutions that endorsed or condemned the role of the United States army in NATO missions to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCaine submitted a resolution that allowed for the limited use of United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill had been rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and had never been put to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would reduce funding for the United States operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in a kind of legislative purgatory -- when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to actually knock the ground out of her feet.
Then events drove the indecision of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and Kaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “receives the people of Libya for its incredible courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “proclaims the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or split legislators like the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans on the Committee, spoke against the latter version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Chamber of Representatives this week should vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some democracies in Congress.
This action, proposed by the member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlot (Republicr, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be submitted to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to amend the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
Gudlat ' s amendment was only one of 68 constitutional amendments addressing a wide range of issues that had been raised in that convening.
Some have been duplicates - the same bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others have been minor variations.
There are at least 15 balanced budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone and some other “over federal expenditure control”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors — mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to paint their summaries — the opportunity to boast that they have “reserved” such an offer.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of an unbinding resolution that supported the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (democracy, New York), wishes to lift the limitation of two terms for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democracy, Illinois) proposed many amendments which guarantee, inter alia, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as is another prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are not moving faster than in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 66 in the 110th.
This rate is as compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when Congress Members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success was no more than it is now.
The most recent amendment adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"Worried but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (democratic party, Arizona), appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, burned down a tune from the Broadway show “The Sun will return tomorrow” and said that he wanted better health than going back to Congress.
Upon arriving at the "20/20" program, ABC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help in walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover from a bullet injury, which disintegrated her skull and crushed her left side of the brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill of ceiling.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang and called her recovery "hard".
To Sawyer's question, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Gifffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 time special issue, which was shown on the eve of the new book Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The special exhibit described the reconstruction of Giffords after shooting on 8 January.
In the video that Kelly made in the first few weeks, she's on a hospital bed with a brown head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physical therapists teach her how to do simple things.
Roll your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word is, "What."
A few days later, Giffords gave the second word, "the toast," to change the menu of breakfast.
The video shown by ABC shows that music was central to Gifford's recovery: we see a congressman singing along with the doctors of "The Girls Just Want to Have Fun" Cindy Loper and "The Free Fall" Tom Patty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said that he didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told me that he was reading Giffords an article in the newspaper about shooting on 12 March when she stopped him to ask him for the first time about the six that were killed then.
The suspect, Jard Lee Lafner, is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day when she was cured, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
'And I said, 'Habby, you're not defeated,' said Kelly.
You're only beaten.
And you'll get through it, you'll get better and come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more sorry than respect
The event was a party at Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock slept in a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines were signaled to land around it.
The audience in the tuxedo cheered him up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
The senior military officer at the concert, who also had the then Chairman of the Chief of Staff Committee, admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really a respect, it was a pity.
The opposite is illustrated by the difficult relations that have developed between the army and the often cold, sometimes admired American public.
Their sacrifices are greatly commended by the soldiers.
But the praises have their price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like they feel pity for people in uniform.
“We are not victims at all”, said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who has led forces in Iraq and is soon on his way to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unfortunate."
It is a sensitive theme for military commanders who do not want to appear to be unappreciative or incoherent with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity takes place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marines, a retired Colonel, Mark Kenshun, warned them that non-military men would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with admiration because they had raised the rebels and had been in exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is “under the mask of a violent evil veteran”, said Kenshun, who fought in Iraq and returned to high government office in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were careful as to whether he would be able to handle the stress of his work in Washington immediately after the war campaign.
Kenshun remembers him saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Wins in the field of battle are rarely commended by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was in World War II,” says Lieutenant General David Brankon, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
Troops estimate the number of campaigns they carried out by the number of comrades they have lost or by the scale of their losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, a historic trial must determine whether 28 men and women will be brought against the army for alleged non-violence by rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Elizabeth Lyman, class one, was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, she claimed to have been raped at night by her co - worker.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male co-worker carrying a package of 12 beers.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
"It was a red fist," Lyman says.
But Texas's mother-in-law had her own fears.
I thought no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't obeyed my instinct then."
A few minutes after they came into Lyman's room, the man came to her back, dropped and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and another 27 current and former military personnel will eagerly await the judgment of the court at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the action they brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmelda will be brought to trial.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C. initially included 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened by their colleagues and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or ensure justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted the highest officials of the army because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence?
Burke also said that she had been contacted by some 400 other victims since February, many of whom could take part in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case, to put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she's going to open up a lot of things if you need to maintain pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents that were received by Newsweek reveal a defence strategy - mainly that former or present soldiers cannot file military claims for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision of Doctrina Feres, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from fighting, this separation exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear line of front.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
Outcome: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time for the army to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her challenge, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academys on charges of promoting a women ' s hate atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a suit against the army, at the centre of which the diagnosis of “personal change” by victims of violence to prevent them from serving is common, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of a human rights group, the Organization for Action of Women Military Forces.
Her team filed a complaint against the Veterans' Office in December, accusing him of having discriminated against applications for pensions from people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during their service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Trafficking ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
But as is known, attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure represents approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of cases: 20 per cent of known cases were brought to trial in 2010, twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The applicants in the Burke case call the attacks only the first in a series of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she stated that she had been raped by the military police less than an hour after it had occurred.
On that night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the attacker's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting before a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was on my face right now, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality changes, making her unserviceable.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with adverse language, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman's case and his comrades are moving forward is a complex question, says John Terry, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
But he says, "In my opinion, they are able to move forward."
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've been critical of Doctrin Feres all my life.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds, "It's very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing fails, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform”, she said.
Or until we die, whatever happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: how researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Braywick was a regular guy who presented his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braywick, who had confessed to Norway ' s massacre in July, which had cost 77 lives, was present at his first public hearing.
Although he could act alone, Braywick was far from alone on the Internet — he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, connecting with millions of nationalists who supported right - wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy, we just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting to them was not easy," says Jamie Bartlett, author of the recently published report on European cyber-populism of the British research centre DEMOS.
The amount of personal data available on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use an advertising tool on the site to highlight the necessary demographic group with scientific precision -- what marketing scientists have done for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then promoted them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad invited the user to a survey that included questions about their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, they were able to interview over 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"It's a brand new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are less impressive: online right-wing groups are mostly male young people who are not satisfied with immigration.
But all of a sudden, "those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor."
The DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a popular new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends expressed in the Lake, posts on the wall and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three records a day, Facebook's “exact information” causes a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the name of the site in its title by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people who are unable to approach on the street with a notebook.
"Early, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join a party and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Fisbook excludes all this, you address them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and study social health problems.
Mégan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues, found that students who discussed their drinking exploits on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their hostels, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates his drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without discovering it," said Washington Post Demetrius Christakis, co-author of Moreno and Director of the Center for Child Health, Conduct and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn't otherwise find."
Facebook also receives various data on its users on a continuous basis.
The site data processing team processed Valentine ' s Relations and Day Statistics, voter turnout in mid-2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mostly using information that they had only access to - cyber-freedom champions had long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for off-line investigations, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users have at least thought that the researcher can observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the public pages of Facebook students.
"It was only between them and their friends as much as they imagined."
Then the question of methodology arises.
Even off-line there's no guarantee that the subject matter of the study is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information is available in the user's profile and on the user's page.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you do outside Facebook, two completely different things," says Selwin.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technology, Selwyn thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available.
"There can be no substitute for getting out into a real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"It is assumed that social research is about social, and most social research is still happening off-line."
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Berging Braywick will be brought to justice for the first time.
Anders Buring Braywick, a man who confessed to having organized a double attack that took 77 lives in Norway this summer, described himself as a "opposing" fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Knights of the Templars of Norway”, he spoke to the 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you've got your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit actions, but I don't admit it."
Judge Torqueil Nesheim interrupted Braywick during this monologism because he “did not want to give Braywick the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views”.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brayvik, who brought a written speech with him, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Brivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from having access to the media for a period of four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came to see Braywick in their eyes, others to make sure he's locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," told the Norwegian NRK channel of one of the Utya survivors.
"It was uncomfortable, but I got a little easier myself after I saw and heard the suspect."
The dark suit and blue Braywick tie kept calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Braywick's strange idea that he was part of a major resistance movement, the judge held that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he had been dealing with accomplices.
Some may be relieved that the attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that is now felt by the entire nation.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but it wasn't," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview shown at the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Designer of Modern times.
But what Apple fans can think of as the greatest discovery in the newly discovered interview that was recalled in advance of pre-commencement in major markets this week is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he thought he was hippy, but he was also the elaborate organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business managers suffered from “the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 per cent of work ... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a great deal of skilled work”.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley set up a TV series of triumphs about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, nearly 10 years had passed since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he had been working with his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of massive Internet development.
While most of Kringley's interview was used in the Nairds, he says that the original interviews were missing during transport.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This discarded material, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A lost interview, which appears in Landmark Theaters on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who is known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unacquainted here to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers -- reflections of 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where the perfectionism of Jobs comes to the surface, where it appears to be irritated by Kringley's questions, prompting him to move more quickly to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In a pre-Pixar era interview, iPods and iPhones, there is something ominously prophetic, when Jobs estimates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' postmortem estimates, but there's something wounded and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
How he learned how to run a business:
I kept asking myself, "Why are you doing this?" and the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just what you're doing."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail its efforts to streamline reporting in Apple.
A method of recording costs, often starting with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then driven by “definition”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business expenditures up to small things.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells us a little bit about the blue box he's muffed with Steve Woznick, a device that enabled people to effectively break up the phone company and call for free.
There's a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria is here when describing the blue box as an act of giving power to the infectious.
He tells us how he and Wozniak were testing the box using a telephone car, talking and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We've covered half a dozen of the globe, and you've been yelling into the automate phone, and it's been just a minute later on the next phone automat," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we've learned is that we've been able to taste something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could have sampled a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever have come along.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous show that he and Wozniak did practically by calling in the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the pope’s phone to do their best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two were ridiculed right before the pope himself was raised to answer by telephone.
About technology in love (and Bill Hewlett's cold name):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts for a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in a phonebook and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job in Hewlett Packard.
"It has had a great impact on me, it was the only company I've seen at the age, and it's shaped my view of what the company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer."
It was about the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electronic beam pipe, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for her.
About improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about inventing new products a summer.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a handful of mounting boards, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
After working only 30 days on credit, he had to think of both the assembly and the delivery of finished equipment.
Later, in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was sitting on my throat, and I went out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About big companies losing energy:
Not long before he led Apple's revival, Jobs saw exactly how many industry leaders would see the situation and lose control of their share of the market.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you're making the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any better.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [these types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and those who produce products are pushed out of the realm of decision-making.
The hyena of the product that led to this monopolistic position is displaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required skill.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times bigger, he could have been Microsoft's 90s...
They were defeated.
On innovation as a form of art:
"A great idea from a great product separates a great deal of skilled work... when you spread a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't force to make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- linking them all together...
After all, it's about taste -- it's about trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever done, and then trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists are copying, great artists are stealing.
We were always ashamed to steal great ideas.
And part of what Macintosh made famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology professionals in the world.
Had it not been for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Skala and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the Health Law while the court is handling the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether he would hear the withdrawal of the law on health care of President Obama, his two judges, Antonine Skalia and Clarence Thomas, they praised the dinner sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case before a higher court.
The case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions before them.
One of the cases on the agenda was a 26-State motion challenging the rapid review of health by Congress last year, a law that united conservative national activists.
The judges agreed to review the process; indeed, a turning debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at an early stage by the time the judgement is delivered.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law on health should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the Pflizer Inc pharmaceutical giant, which has great financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate, and a prominent opposer of the Health Act.
Honorable guests for dinner?
Nothing new: Two judges have been attending the activities of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judges may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the programme of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Skala and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as with a company with a large financial interest, was sufficient as a signal for ethical activists in the Government.
“It is a shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code contrary to statements by some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules as are applicable to all other federal judges”, said Bob Edgar, President of the General Department of Justice.
"The judges drank and had dinner at the official fund-raising event with the lawyers, whose cases are now being tried in court."
Their emergence and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Skalica and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with trial groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny's, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue with regard to Judge Elena Kagan rather than Skala and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in Obama's administration when the first legal objections to the law were raised at the level of the first intervention court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in the defence of the law in order to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion aircraft order
The Emirates Air Force orders 50 wide-story Boeing 777 ships and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, transaction size more than $1 billion.
It's hardly news that a company gets an order for 50 items of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is Boeing Co, and the price of all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing got the order: The Middle East, the growing gold lived up to future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 fixed-wing aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing denounced on this weekend its largest dollar equivalent for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777.
An incredible order was received from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to purchase 20 more aircraft that will raise the total presurervative price to $26 billion, saying Boeing on Aviashaw Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, reported Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, who could boast of much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The pre-surrett price for six fixed-wing aircraft would be more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
“The quality of these particular buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but they also have an increase in fuel prices, which is usually detrimental to airlines, as it is one of their biggest expenditure items, not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the aircraft's order when prices go up, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for broad-sky aircraft and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from attacking his domination with his A350 airliner.
The Boeing won the plane four months after Airbus stated that it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which coincided with the 777-300ER.
He set aside the debut to increase the load of seed after the buyers had demanded an increase in the capacity and range of flight.
The Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the Michoacán elections
Louise Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers assisted Fausto Vallejo's opponent from IPR in an election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister did not seem to have implemented her application to the position of Governor Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that the drug traffickers had helped to induce one of her opponents into the race.
Preliminary results indicate that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IPR, is the leader in the race for the Western State Governor.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoana, but also for the entire country”, said Louise Maria Calderón in radio interviewing the day after Sunday.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the elections... "They boasted the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IPR.
FI was run by Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It prepares a return, and winning Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
IPR hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have been just a little bit overrun by Calderón, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party, or PND led by her brother, refused to accept Valleho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, now owned by the Governor ' s chair, came a third, severe defeat for the split and failed left in front of the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morel State capital, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
Drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines had long dominated Michoana.
This is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues to exist.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he advocated for Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates left the local election race out of fear.
For the IPR, however terrible the elections in Michoacán would be, the victory would give a driving impetus to the party.
The man who was supposed to represent IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging before next year."
ADB persuades Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has pledged India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of the ADB Office in Manila, said that two of the fastest-growing major economies must “do whatever they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “intrusively” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We all care."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be incontrovertible."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing funds have grown alarmingly and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe had given rise to fears that it could once again lead the world economy to recession and had led to calls for the leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Negh predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, funds for financial stability in Europe -- was a great force in the negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce of India, said that “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is currently experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have enormous challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a prerequisite, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young men and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies like India there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warshni, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to help Europe 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on or less than $2 a day.
"At some point they'll find that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to holidays on the sea, and it won't be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, was also wondering why Indian reserves should be used to hold Greek, numerous and well paid public sector employees in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “low-risk” threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to draw up “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from falling and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's frightening warnings of potential reductions in defence costs
Defence Minister Leon Panette set the stage on Monday at the Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and generate a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan on a line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already on track with a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but it is now feared that an additional 600 billion or more reductions may be inevitable if Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
“The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry”, said Panette in a letter to the senators of the Republic, John McCaine, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress ' s failure to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sector had initiated a global reduction of 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a severe reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and will cause serious damage to other modernization attempts," wrote Panette to the senators.
“We will also have to fire many of our civil servants and, since the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civilian staff to achieve the goal.”
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to our readiness."
Abbreviations eventually affect the military, said Panette.
“Although military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sector, military achievements will be seriously affected by a major budget breakdown”, Panette warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, resulting in the termination of contracts and contracts of oversight that support troops.”
“Staff personnel will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote Pannet 10 days ago requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
“The effect of the section of the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the world's leading military power.”
"We stand against these dragon attacks," reported the senators in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they announced Panette's letter.
"It's not the way we live with, and it's not the way we should impose ourselves."
“The server is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, which cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the Panette's letter or the latest senator's warnings to a budget compromise will lead to a stronger appeal for the Pentagon's release from the cuts, we will see later.
The Panette was completely desensitized about possible reductions, although he had come to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary review in Congress and the White House and was aware that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a disheartening picture of what might follow -- the troops with the shell, but without the nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a unit without bullets."
"It's the wing of the plane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without trained soldiers capable of carrying out a mission," said Panette in her introductory remarks in the Pentagon.
"It is a force which suffers from an unstable spirit of warfare, poor preparedness and inability to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
The annex to its letters to McCaine and Graham Panette gave further details on the way in which reductions “delay significant operational risks: slow the response to crises, conflicts and catastrophes; seriously limit our ability to be first in deployment and in the global response; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panette said that some of the biggest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already passed the tests, and some only at the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single F35 fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ' s ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the Army and the Marine Infantry require to replace the Hammer.
The end of further development and testing F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other opponents.
How to catch a lie
A keen look at the latest headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate for the Republicans Herman Kane is engaged in questioning the allegations of sexual harassment of several women; each party blames the other for lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with false testimony because they allegedly concealed a retired football coach who raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught when, with a microphone involved, he told U.S. President Barak Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York congressman and the Internet expansionist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool, denying his findings, which was quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital ties.
Again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term in office.
The stories of fraud at school and college exams are routine.
There have been instances where teachers have given students answers to their tests in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
Teachers, who must teach the opposite, report that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day studies show that you may be lied between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Exposing lies or believing lies is a necessary skill for every individual or professional purpose.
Unlike a room game like, say, charades where to call "Duck!", finding lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study was that most of the old myths of lies had been scattered.
Liars look in the eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, red, or laugh.
It should not be concluded from this that liars are difficult to see and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can reach the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the washout, the structure of the issues and the time-frames.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-increasing segment of false knowledge, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include retruding, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
The good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel unsatisfied, controlling their own emotions and intuitively feeling as others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than they lie to their partners (but the lies they say most often lie).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do I know if someone's lying?
First, watch your object's normal behavior.
It's called the definition of baseline.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Watch your object's posture, laughter, voice characteristics.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly kicking in his feet, and then you will not make an unfair charge when you see him knocking in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for groups of misleading notes and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet towards the door, move towards the exit, change their posture in some way, or show “simplification after an interview” -- this exaggerated breath of relief and a change of position when all the difficult issues are behind them.
Investigators often falsify the sign of the end of the interrogation in order to just look at this relief after an interview.
So, pay attention to your object's speech.
Scott Peterson was known to have fallen and used his time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searching throughout the country.
Acquiring people may also use distance in their speech: “I had no sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky” or repeat the complex issue in its entirety.
The most typical note indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use "skill language" when they answer the difficult question: "All right, I'm telling you, how far do I know... how far I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means of identifying lies, but it is possible to master the detection of deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not being a victim of skilled liars in professional and personal life.
A coherent plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be reviewed after a U.S. threat to delay its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- by glamorizing trade unions, but by calming environmental defenders -- a company that is about to build a pipeline -- claims that it will willingly revise the project to resume its work on it.
Transkanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would be approved.
The company made this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitolia.
Tranada's official, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be approved for the pipeline, albeit with another route.
This is following a statement by the Department of State last week that it will defer the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores possible new routes that do not affect the area of Nebraska Hills and Ogalala ' s Aquifer, a huge groundwater reservoir of water.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the Department of State is likely to delay the decision until 2013, after next year ' s election, although the authorities denied that the decision was a political one.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as an appeal of the State Department and expressed support for it.
The oil pipeline has a length of 1,700 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loves trade unions, which hope for approximately 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who oppose the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand hills and Ogalala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department's environmental impact study showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had commissioned a separate examination of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyer hired by Transkanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, is representing a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was the choice of a firm that had been hired for an initial study that was not appropriate because it was related to TransCanada.
Patty La Bell was sued for allegedly causing a child to suffer from fear
A New York City family claims that Patty La Belle's disco-divorce began to lobby their homes in Manhattan, frightening their young daughter to such a degree that it was full of fear.
Lady Marblee was so scared by her 18-month-old manager, Genevieve Monk, that she carried out “screeching, sleeping disorders” and “a strong fear of strangers”, says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10th, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten instructor, Rosanne, and Genevieve were about to travel on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was fishing for a car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside, carrying their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes and went to take her," she said.
La Belle angrily pronounced a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanne Monk.
I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came into rage and began to use swearing -- a word for C and a word for F -- in increased pitch...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve started hysteria.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
La Belle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escort had to hold her back and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanne Monk.
The baby cried so hard that she got tired, she added.
The family later sent an apology note to La Belle, but did not receive an answer.
Counsel and representatives of La Belle do not answer the telephone for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken up the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate any money he would receive to the charity of children suffering from cancer.
"The aim is to force Patty Label to take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign of Mario López in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market had risen, foreign financing had declined and the economy had been weakened.
2011 - which will be part of the economic history of Sinoloa as the Government ' s first year, Mario López Valdez, also known as the Year of Change, which gave rise to great hopes for economic development but, given the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, did not grow, but the main indicators of economic development were recorded.
Not only did the low temperatures of February lead to the loss of millions to the agricultural sector, but they limited the potential for growth of the public economy, resulting in a decline of 3.6 per cent in total economic activity in the first half of the year, largely due to a historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by the freeze provided by the Council of Mexico for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in whole and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, an accelerated rise in unemployment was recorded during the first three quarters, from January to March 55,053 in Sinaloa were unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, from the second quarter increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September, it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a proportion that is more than 74,000 unemployed people in Sinloa, an increase of 18.969 from the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been dominated over the course of the year by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (USA), unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law adopted by Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is difficult for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, to invest and use them in something," he said.
Resumed immigration
López Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of employment abroad have been limited in the United States, primarily because of the difficulties of entry, and in the second, because, once they have entered, they are already facing very many difficulties in finding jobs, so that a group of people remain and demand jobs here in the state, as a result of the rising unemployment rate," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is getting worse by drawing attention to the large number of violations prevailing in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and processing irregularities, a further reminder of State employment is provided by low wages; the State has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was well below the national average of 7,375 pesos until September.
FDI reduction
In addition to declining economic activity and high unemployment rates, 2011 recorded the largest outflow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, between January and July State FDI amounted to $630,697. This represents a drop of 87.74 per cent compared with $5,143.312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government ' s Minister of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos investments during the year, mostly from service companies.
Debt
In view of the economic downturn, the State Government requested in July, during the State Congress, the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos had been approved at the local level, and no sector of the state economy had been expected to benefit from debt until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez shows a lack of Government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the State Government itself.
“The economic efficiency of Sinaloa was really low this year, we have to work hard to get back the positions lost this year, in 2012, we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, on the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that next year will be much better”, he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth this year.
“The low size of the economy is the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects is a slow economy that is not fast enough to create economic dynamics that allow for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations”, he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state must continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we found that we were working on this, we believe that we need to develop a long-term programme that will change the direction and economic course of the state, and we need to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coormex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better direct the Government's efforts.
"On the whole, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas; there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy manner.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that there's a lot to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day income fine - a Navolato national was sentenced for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of an offence against health, was in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
In the case of AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the streets of Cypruso Valdés before post No. 80 in the town of Castillo, Navolato.
A drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck carrying a black box in a car car and a small backpack in a passenger seat where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to remain in detention at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to Work Must be made
Public works related to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining unfinished or delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger because the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which represented an amount exceeding 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent was due, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although a year is over, they have not given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a piece of money since the beginning of July," he said, "so that we can't delay, we've started work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not made any contributions he was due to make, so at the beginning of the municipal government, it had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been provided by the State administration in that case.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate, and the programmes continued to evolve, and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state had left behind,” he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarealo, to increase efforts so that interest on them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to pay almost 12 million, and even though a year ends, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve “digital television” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals for digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (WB) rejected the constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which carries the so-called “digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Messa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing actions for the transition to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected owing to the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes necessary for the court to speak on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and remain in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right enshrined by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) Act, in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Moon and Sánchez Correro voted in favour of the project.
On this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and to support complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it concerning the transition to digital broadcasting.
The Ministerial Meeting also decided to reject the demands of the Chamber of Deputies without having to discuss the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the project ' s arguments in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules of action for which the public administration should prepare.
“I also don't think that, if it did, it would have an impact on regulatory autonomy” and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as telecommunications was relevant to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate, State administration.
The conversion of analog signals to digital signals, one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has resulted in better use of the radio-electronic spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would have meant postponing the benefits of conversion into digital form, which included meeting public needs, which had not only a technical dimension “because it covered economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “require the whole system of State economic governance to include a group of authorities which the Constitution brings together into the State executive power”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcasting exercise and had done so through the executive branch, despite the existence of specific technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacán, the possibility of counting “voice by voice” is being analysed.
According to the data transmitted to the PRRA, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governorate's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “voting by voice” is real with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, Maria de Los Angeles Landeral Saragos, President of the General Council of the Council of the Institute for the Elections of Michoacán (IVM), recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Corps had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress had approved reforms shortly before their entry into force in the electoral process, and Governor Leone ' s Year Book had not included his publication within the time frame stipulated in the Act in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJJ) ruled on the constitutional claim put forward by the local legislative assembly and called “unvalid and unlawful” the State Representative's voice on constitutional reform because he was not entitled “to permit or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of “voting vote”, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that, with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council, it would be possible to provide partial or full counting of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the urn or not with the President; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, the overall conversion of votes in all ballot boxes may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner candidate for the election and those who won the second seat is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a petition from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that presented the second candidate.
The total counting will also be done if the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second seat is found to be less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a petition from the political party whose candidate has taken the second place, in the event that the ballot boxes have been excluded, which have been partially counted.
It is worth noting that such elections are held in Morelia, where, according to the ELV, the difference between the first and second seats is only 0.16 per cent, even excluding 129 votes out of a total of 923 Protocol votes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam, confirming his family.
The remains of the Filipe pilot, Basio Cortés, arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday night; on Monday an inspection and a quiet Mass was conducted.
According to the family, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam.
Following the acceptance of condolences with others who had died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital city of Coaouila on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived in a shelter located at Nazarío Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5: 30 a.m., he was examined by the Santo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and football team, who was a member of Filipe Basio during secondary school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always told his family and friends," was what Sandra Cortés Basio, a pilot's sister, said.
In her view, the Lieutenant Colonel has fulfilled all her dreams, and she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio, a very young man, left the town of Saltillo to attend the College of Aviation in Sapopan, Khalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he had a headache, even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man "when he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The youth recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for a diploma ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving a plane.
He's got to get out of the way.
The guns were fired after the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Technical Secondary School in Saltillo, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress in both his studies and sports.
Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he controlled suffered a crash, along with the Secretary of Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake More, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés (conservated), Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral office of members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martínez, on the esplanade of the training school, where his family had already waited for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, pupils and teachers.
Three bodies were found abandoned at the NL Kaderate farm
A few hours before detection, the military authorities had shown in the media 11 persons who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot on an abandoned farm in Kaderate Jiménez municipality, Nuevo León.
The find was found at 1.5 kilometres of Kadereyt's road towards Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
A few passersby noticed that a village house, whose wall was painted into a beige and brown wall, had an open gate.
When they looked inside, literally three meters, they found three bodies, they immediately informed the authorities concerned.
One of the men wore a yellow t-shirt with black jeans, without footwear, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Almost one metre contained the other person’s body, a red shirt, and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no Guilles on the ground.
There are signs on the fence of the village house addressed to one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullets holes in it and in the gates.
11 Investigated in Caderet
The Ministry of National Security had submitted 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that had been active mainly in the municipality of Kaderate and were accused of abductions, murders, “frauds” and secret graves.
According to published information, eight persons were detained in Los Alvero colony initially on 11 November, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, requiring to become members of a criminal group called “Los Zetas”.
Another event took place on 12 November at 0600 a.m., and military personnel made a patrol tour of the village of Old Rancho in Kaderjet when they saw a car without licence plates with two men in the cabin.
After leaving them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a patron and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hina and Kaderate.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that has placed the country on the verge of economic catastrophe.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic catastrophe and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace said that Monty, who had been appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a Cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive branch will take up its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period”, said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not expressly say that he had been able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"It's now well marked," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy has faced a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level
The administration, led by the former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the rigid economy package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy.
Based on the pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have established income from Italian BTP bonds of 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said that we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's prospects for success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alphaano, Secretary of the Centralist Law Party.
Support for LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of the technocrats that Monty is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular hard-saving reforms.
Any closure or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meetings Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who allowed a rapid transition to respond to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, the value of Italy's debts had now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial advocates.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that politicians would only give him time to reform before new elections were appointed.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be composed only of technical specialists, a testament to the fact that the financial situation affects the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more play experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 had already played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A small contrast to Costa Rica, compared to 22 players called by both countries for a social match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the champions of the world and Europe, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a full list of class A voting games, Tricolor has only Michael Ouman's lawyer as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish football players playing all the stars in the League and in the strong clubs of the Prime League of England were very active this year in the league and local Cup competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To that end, we should add Spanish furry experience to the complex skills of Europe or the World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We can see that the list in the Spanish prefabricated Hulkipper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match sold by 0-1 in London) echoed the record of Andon Subsarrets' exhalers, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolon today and set a new record at 127 international matches for Spain.
Havi Hernández, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Kasillas and Havi were considered best last week by UEFA, together with another player of the Iberian team, Sub-zarret, with 126 matches and bomber Shaalke Raúl Gonzalez with 102.
It's close to a hundred carles Poyles with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Injest with 62, Sister Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From Costa Rica, next to Michael Umana, the left side of Hunior Diaz, with 48 matches and a bomber, Brian Ruiz, with 45.
Further, only five have reached the goal of 30 games: Cailor Nawas since 31; Randall Asoffa since 32; Michael Barrantes since 31; Carlos Hernández with 36; and José Luis López with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Céricrio Bouquets (36), Santiago Santa Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbelloa (31) and Raúl Albíola (31).
In a collection of less than 30 exits on the field, there's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Muy with 23.
The rest did not reach even 20.
Although Nacho Morreal has only four, and Hardy Alba has two, Victor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
The leading Spanish player, David Villa, is 50-foot, followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz has become one who has brought more points than Carlos Hernández and three times as many as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintett included the country in his tour for 20 years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream which has come true.
In an exclusive interview Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group said that it was also a dream to them to play in that country.
It was a bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview from Viva in Brazil last week.
The Group is located in South America as part of a tour for the twentieth anniversary of work and on Sunday, 20 years, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will speak at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group of Las Roberts.
It's an excerpt from a conversation that has full decryption on-line in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still going well.
I was only in Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for having been with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, while waiting for your concert, treat it as the largest show of a year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope this led us into the shape of this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we like to engage in surfing and jungles with regard to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We've got a lot of surfers, and I've got a good friend who lives in Tamarinda, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends always drive surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, which is a great place for surfing, and that's how we learned about it from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you might say that you've made grand shows with lots of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to make the best show out of the most diverse songs possible; we're going to try to play several songs from every album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we might forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
In this tour you observe 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to travel around the world where we've always wanted to go.
For us, everything is going to be very good.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the gravitation?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large groups.
We're good friends with Soundgarden guys, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, there is one group from the same city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at one time in the same city.
We're proud and it's an honor to be part of Seattle's team.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhony, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and for us the honor of being part of Seattle's sound that happened.
It's also very strange that the group like you stay together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together 21 years ago, and Matt (Cameeron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened that give everyone freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not have been better.
Your attitude toward the word has not been easy, but your success has enabled you to do everything you wanted.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We're taking care not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you've done without choosing to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Master Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We were a group of almost three years old and did not release any album until Andy’s death.
There was a lot of frustration because it's been so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Hilmore) who started with us in a group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about Andy's incredible person, and as he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
It was a wonderful person, and we miss him.
The local group, Las Roberttas, will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video suggestions, and it was a group that liked us most, so we are eager to see that Las Roberttas can offer us a live one, and it should be very exciting.
Why do you always change what you say at Yale Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes into his mind.
Who affected you like a bassist?
There's so many of them.
Among the first people to come to your mind, Gezer Butler, John Entvisl, CJ Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCarthy, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the fence, even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling some isolation from the word grand.
When I think of him, he reminds me of groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhooney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came in at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are now making music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there's a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breate that are considered very dark though they may sound a little bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, those songs were very dark.
I think that when you're growing up, and in your life there's been some kind of trauma and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for a medical examination
The ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State hospital for a muscle loss test, which occurs in his legs, reported to his family doctor.
Fuhimori, 72, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the language, which has led to his operation four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agina, who is his personal physician, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in his lower limbs.
Agina said that he believed that Fuchimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations to cancer of the language, lost 18 kilograms of blood, and other diseases, such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and leg bleeding problems, were listed by the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the Police National Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 members of the army destruction unit, which operated in secret during the first few years of his reign.
It is on its way to Mexico to strengthen political ties.
The official delegation, headed by President José Muhika of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive on this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political issues of the region.
It will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the plan to meet with the political, commercial authorities and to meet with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule issued by the authorities of Uruguay.
The two Presidents' meeting in the city of Guadalajara will be “a good opportunity to exchange information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Calderón for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Kana.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that led to Uruguay ' s protest and withdrawal for consultation by his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing a group of the most developed and developing countries since November, and has in fact had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's “series list” of countries that do not use international standards for tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The mature plumber will become three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pic from the evil paws of Boser, but he never before did it in three dimensions: at Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, has been created taking into account the characteristics of the portable 3DS console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how the stereoscopy will work without eyes," said Nintendo's head of press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the Madrid game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is “the first video game of Nintendo specially designed for this platform”, because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a “accessible” video game that allowed for fast and mobile games.
Alvarez said Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one game: the first part is simple to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go round and round to play levels that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between “D aggressive” or something that affects only the depth of action, but on which they have to play three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and “do not give up on optical illusions”.
This incursion of Super Mario into three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo amplifies the fans of the show and repeats a successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a muster needs to pass through dangerous minefields to free Princess Pic.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "playing."
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process, Alfonso Portillo, had begun to answer in the United States for a 70 million-dollar conspiracy.
This concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that required the extradition of Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed extradition.
He claimed that, during his mandate, he had not “tangled hands” to legal decisions and had adopted all extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Serhio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, as well as Edgar Estrade Morales and Victor Estrad Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted for the purpose of prosecuting the State's ex-heads from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (JC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the waste of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process preceding extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are socially excluded helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added.
The anniversary was the occasion for an outcome at a ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where over 300 people arrived.
Trinijove came into the world near Trinit Velia in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or who are marginalized.
Last night, San Ant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had cooperated with the association during this 25-year period.
The different political representation during the elections showed the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor, Khordi Puchol, an ex-consultant of Socialist education, Ernest Maragal, attended the ceremony, and an ex-telecrant of the mayor and the current ecoscialist, member of the municipal council, Richard Goma.
Also found in Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare and family consultant, José Lewis Clerice and CoE for social work, La Caixa, Haume Lanapusa.
He said that Trinijove had appeared in very difficult times and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far “is a good basis”.
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting bad circumstances and inspiring hope in people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not a new one for the organization and work done by her," he said.
The captured building where mass parties were organized was evacuated
Hostages occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmez Street, 51
The 12 occupiers left the building last night at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living at 51 Balmez Street came to an end.
Twelve people left the building at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbors by a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From now on, there will be a pass-over," said the manager.
The squirters, who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the building, took all the electricity and parts of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is the night club Balmez 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income had fallen by 80%.
The club owner says that the owners of the building took her into unfair competition because they sold her drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the neighbors ' complaints about noise, although she noted that noise was not caused by visitors to the club but by the inhabitants of the scott and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, whose frequency and intensity increased, according to angry neighbors.
The club owner said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it had been nine months since he had "forgiven" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received from neighbours in recent weeks.
The Chairman of the municipal group PP, adviser Alberto Fernando Díaz, demanded last week “an immediate evacuation of the building in order to address the problems of coexistence and the general spirit of the neighbours and the degradation in this area”.
A popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before summer, but during the past few months, skwitters had invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them had been broken.
In this sense, he added, "must put an end to impunity and stand firm against the culture created in the building."
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police went to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a post-contributory competition
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now exhausted Barcelona Capital Corporation (CSC), this administration printed pro-listies for Kolserola.
The tract described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCS, in 1987 the park again took a place in the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, which is not North-South, but upwards (mount) downwards (sea).
The positioning of Collserol as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with wild boar as Yoga's bear.
That was so, until, in September, the council announced no huge competitions, consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates to Kolserol.
By the gate is the idea of the park, of course.
Either it is, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, "Colserol"?
The competitions and their organization and their impact on the city are a topic for discussion by all architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repeated topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people come to know each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few similarities between what three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roddan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: Competition is appropriate
For Rhosdan, once the shore is reached, it becomes “necessary” to discuss “the front side of the mountain” when the proposal of Ildephon Serda, the mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We must assume that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
"Colserol is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title of the "Kolserol's Gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as entrance to the park, but as limiting certain areas where we should act."
Modolo, as Roddan and Bayon, with their experience in urban construction, called the proposal “an intellectual task” with “some hazards”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of public space forecasting” following the experience of the 80s, which ended at the Forum's “his swan song”.
The first fear is the limitation of boundaries, where you can build them.
“Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step”, that is, the transition.
“We should think of new urban planning tools because current [in relation to the capital master plan (GSP)] can lead to a real disaster.”
Close to point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside the Calserola that “shouldn't miss the ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join this project “from the beginning”.
Moreover, we realize that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to engage in debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is what should lead interdisciplinary teams (“the success”, he claims), which should have created: “The architects must be only an instrument”.
Bayon suggests that the answer to the question that names this part is complicated because the rules of the competition lack a general kind of Colserol: “There were 16 overlapping competitions,” he says, “in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole”.
This requires, at least in his case, 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate may overlap by programme and definition with the architect for the adjacent gate.
From your point of view, the council has the responsibility to guarantee that the lane directly above Rhonda de Dalt must provide a full area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Kazino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and he'll be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative, Red Casino, pardoned the Mayor of Monterrey's brother in proceedings against him for extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be free after legal representative Red Casino has granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extortion against the Mayor ' s brother, Monterrey.
Following the Casino Royale bomb, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow Monterrey authorities to permit a secret operation in the game house.
Following a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor General opened criminal proceedings against the mayor ' s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the State capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the requirements of the second order prohibiting displacement after the prosecutor had excluded the offence of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaderate for allegedly extortioning half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence of Jonas ' guilt was evident, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative, Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could have his freedom in the following hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor of the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if he had recovered damages and who of the partners of the gambling house granted pardon, although counsel tried not to make a name.
Based on the records of 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrazabal and no statements could be made concerning the process planned against him; nor would there be any reparation or punishment required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at about 15:50 p.m., Larrasabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The court official, Jorge Janez, went to San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to notify Jonah that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by a judge.
Minister Dionycio Pérez Hakomé describes the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MTS) reported that the results of the accident in which Francisco Blake Mora, Minister of the Interior, and seven others, had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground in a state of complete integrity without piloting an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements which seem to show that the ship had several contact with the land, wings made contact with trees 25 metres, where the dish was lost."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the research carried out in the area of impact did not report the existence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
“The aircraft was intended for 19 passengers, which met the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of between 7 and 30 degrees.
By now, the Secretary said, above all, that it was possible to obtain the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroports and Support Services, said that during the attack, a presidential helicopter operated at a cruise speed and that it happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a regular flight manoeuvre at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hakomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight took place under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports found suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed for a border area between the city of Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the conditions of the clouds, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the valley of Kuernawaka.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the radar of the aircraft are probably the same as those of the aircraft before the impact, and there is no loss of control or change of direction.
Difference of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact has taken place on both front and side lines.
The fragmentation of the debris suggests that the helicopter has encountered land in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster area, there remains undetected evidence in the wreckage of a ship, some type of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that there may have been multiple contacts with land.
During their work on site, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level and the ground has a range of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
Information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study of more territory than the designated area near the site of the disaster, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces the obesity gene search program
Social protection leads a study on the search for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN professionals
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect obesity in children and young people, which is called the protocol “Getics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents”, which will calculate the weight-related signs.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Medical Research Unit for Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (whether prescribed or not) to participate in MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where every Saturday, from 8:00 in the morning, tests involving children will be conducted.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be maintained at the sports centre in Quautemoke (west of Mexico City) and that since 8 October the events were being held at the sports centre in Nesaualkootle, eastern Mexico.
Once the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the main objective will be to gather three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with parental permission and supervision to complete individual feeding questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors leading to diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that on Saturday, all participants (weight, growth and cover of the waist), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child obesity) would be measured.
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in just six years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent were obese, in the case of girls, 47 per cent; in the case of underweight, there has also been a significant increase,” said MSSI.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans were 65 per cent descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent of the descendants of Europeans and five per cent of the descendants of Africans, and this condition had an impact on the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics is the body's inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and it is put off in fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could reveal whether they had any level of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the existence of dark folds on the neck (aractants) and forearms means the possibility of a violation of metabolicism and even prediabeticism.
The information is treated confidentially, and the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents to whom they explain all the measures and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, or lack of daily physical activity, most of the day at home in front of television, and use of transportation on small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. the increased use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tales, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic predisposition analysed in this programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a study at UNAM School of Chemistry, developed polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality resistant to the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by road coverage were to be taken into account, it would be necessary to repair some 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the Mehiko Valley, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a chemical researcher at UNAM, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalted road surface were to be regulated, the number of pits could be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the Technical View of Measles, which was read in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing polymer-moderated battoms for the production of a mixture of bitumen, but with a better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some towns in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus prevent the formation of pits.
He explained that bitum, the heavyest part of oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some a high molecular mass called asphaltones, and others a low molecular mass called malformations, which together give road coverage its characteristic viscous behaviour.
The viscosity of the bitumen is that at a high temperature of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not permanent, but changes over the course of the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
He noted that Mexico City’s streets were largely covered with a flexible cover made of six layers of material, the last three of which included bitumen.
Among the upper layers is a bitumen made up of small stones, dropped into bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this surface, he says, is sunk in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and applying force, this helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt floor, he added, was placed by the last layer, called the wear layer, made out of a small stone, actually sand, also loaded into asphalt.
Since this layer will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it must be more resistant than asphalt and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, wear and tear also requires appropriate thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature declines, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on asphalt.
When the land is raw, the water enters the surface and is difficult to get out of it, causing every layer of surface to be softened and thus creating a hole.
When creating a hole, he said, the first one was worn out and only then affected bitumen, but the damage did not happen instantly, which should be taken into account in the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System explained that transport is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of surface must always be related to the transport load and must be guaranteed to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent the frequent appearance of holes.
Raphael Herrera said that relatively bitumen still had much to study and do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries were already on the market and even helped to make pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What didn't the Valle candidate have to do to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Meline Ramírez from getting Ms. Colombia's crown.
Valle's representative was given the title of Princess at 14.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only wanted the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Cerna was to be content with being on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and tape proclaiming her new Princess of Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss won the crown and the violin, the Department has 14 named princesses, and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, including Miriam Opina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belini Aala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monika Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinédo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hissey Alhore Harris (2000), Katalina Hiraldo (2007), Stefanis Harris Alhourure (2008).
The question that many people are now asking is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main court, which in each of the presentations showed that she has everything to become a new Miss Columbia, not just so she was elected Queen of Police and the most beautiful person in the version of Vā, the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatyana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received Ms. Colombia's crowns.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she was not able to answer the question, "What book does characterize you, and why??" asked Martin Murilla Gómez of literary society.
She replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of education, and I certainly think that the book that characterizes my childhood, Little Prince, is a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Prime and Punishment," which is a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemrovsky, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Blood Fire."
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “education” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books cited identified it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and content with her result: "The wise are all things to come."
All of you, please, read a little bit, Little Prince is a great book."
Among the pronounced hypotheses, Valle was burned by favouritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was preferred, she was evacuees, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's culinary competition, the public vote for the best national suit, and Queen Mata), “which stirred the jealousy of other candidates, caused the Queen's stress, and as a result she was not flashing on the stage”.
And that was when she first appeared in her swim at Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she was confident in both, it was evident that she lacked the energy and energy that Magdalena and Atlantic women had shown.
"Aryel Osorio, journalist for the "Kas Home" program on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named Princess "is saying that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become queen."
In addition, Valle recently avoided communication with the press and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle's representative failed in her attempt to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the Kradota National Competition.
That's why two days before she chose an international jury member, Lucy Dotti, said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, but we need to look not only at appearance but also at public consciousness before they participate in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also assumed that Valle's representative was guilty of defects on berries and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but it was controversial because the jury had highlighted her as a candidate of “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernán Orosco's consultant notes that Melina had no better body than she had, “but the problem of fibrosis on my stomach, which was not very visible to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day.”
Among other things, journalist Guido Ojos of the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical interventions.
"Operations are good, but representative Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize first presented to the organizers of the National Beauty Competition last night, it is said that it was a man given by Raimundo to Melina as compensation for her loss of pleasure in getting her crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact that Melina now has a year of government, not as queen, but as princess, is the position that allows her to represent Colombia in an international competition, as indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will come into history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Cali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, CTI Cali came into history as a man who confirmed the identity of Head FARC Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminals, this week Elisar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tehad who has spent 21 years in the investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completion of his courses, he became a specialist in forensic science, where he studied skin friction, i.e., palms and walls.
On the week of Elisera's identification operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Kauka to Palmiro.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saenza (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not identify him by his outward appearance; he was very different from what was being displayed in the media.
He was beardless, dressed as a local farmer, with no glasses and much worse.
But prints don't lie.
Using the magnifying glass, ink, blade, and flashlight, she compared the fingerprints of the body to those in the pictures.
His eyes did not let go; it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the leader of FARC.
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant for a specialist in the area of Dactilospia of Sijin from Cali.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactyoscopy is a hard science, no error, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, Dactiloscopy experts are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify detainees.
Many offenders in detention have false certificates or do not have documents.
We take their prints and seek them in the base.
The researcher said that in case of theft, he had to take away a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief used his hands to control the safe, full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with the walls because they're not easy surfaces to take prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the criminal who's been involved in several thefts," he says.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with bottles from under the licker around him was recently found.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative could have been suspected of having committed a crime and that, indeed, the fingerprints on the bottle were the same.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
The CTI Dactiloscopy specialist explained that chemical or physical reagents were being applied to the place where the fingerprints were found.
When they show up, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
The fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is the crime database or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television programme.
Just as not all the glistening gold doesn't all you touch leave prints on yourself.
However, if this is possible, the comparison shall be made.
The angry people challenge the New York authorities.
Hundreds of protestors camped in front of Zuccotti Square.
A number of the protesters listened to the court ' s decision to chase the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
The Wall Street Detention movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to enter again, under the protection of a court order, into Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protestors were buried in the Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed the angry people to break camp in the square while another part of the movement responded to the race, captured a park in the north of the city where further arrests were conducted
"Our idea is that, since the court won't allow us to break camp in the square, we will break camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the representatives of the Wall Street Movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “wrong people” to the evacuation of the tent town ordered by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, had come to court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, “flamed people” have begun to seize a new park located on the scene of a merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish of the Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they could occupy this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protestors, although Bray could not say the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents at the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement by trying to mediate with the police.
However, the area of Zukotti, which is privately owned, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning ' s protesting.
Some of the protestors who went there carried and distributed copies of that court order and even provided copies of it to police officers guarding the area, which resulted in “some minor clashes”, said Bray, who said that some police officers were beating demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating Wall Street members and forcing them to enforce “laws that were issued after the invasion had begun or preventing demonstrators from re-accessing the park with stores and other property used earlier”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that this court order had suspended the opening of public spaces and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from re-opening tent shops and sleeping bags.
A municipal council member personally justified the removal of protestors from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation during which about 200 arrests were carried out, and a decision was taken because the protestors had “obviated the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered to clear the area because it was “a place where people came not to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people” because “some businesses had been threatened” and neighbors feared “for deteriorating the quality of life”.
The evacuation this morning was repugnant and shows that deep down in Bloomberg's soul there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for “honouring freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for the Wall Street Grab also indicated that they intended to organize “serious actions” on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bouble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear in the television program Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen's "The Great Repair," a rescuer at "The Malybu Rescuers," Bannie's "Playbohe", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with a raven (a ballad performer) by Michael Boublet and other prominent Canadians, would appear in Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1, as a very special Maria.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known on the Internet for a widely distributed home pornographic video where she appears along with her husband, a mötley Crüe drummer of Tommy Lee, appears dressed as Virgin Maria, holding a doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comic book recently led by Charlie Shin's "My Hard Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canada's Bubla singer, who married in Buenos Aires in late March in the special Christmas show CTV, is part of the Argentine model Luísian Lopilato, who also knows the use of scandals.
Recently, Buble called the U.S. "suck" Kim Kardashian at one of his concerts in New York
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the fallout that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that has been experienced by the land of the rising sun since World War II.
The Tokyo Government first estimated the material losses to be $300,000 million, a blow that seems to be taking place despite a difficult world situation.
After three off-the-shelf quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn over the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
Registered in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate between January and March 2010.
The recovery can be attributed in part to the resumption of the purchase of machine equipment for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against the 0.9 per cent decrease in capital costs from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real turning point in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenesian momentum, which calls for the use of a crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly as a result of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This increased by 1 per cent under increased costs of cars, travel and rest.
The yen glue.
Tokyo provided the domestic market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the “residency currency” chosen by investors who want to escape the debt crisis in the euro area and negative U.S. projections, a privilege that has been imposed as a stone on exporting companies.
In a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large process companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to be the siege of the EU ' s offshore countries, the Government of Esikhico Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of yen, said yesterday Economic Minister Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts a breakdown in the world economy, has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell to four tenths to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points, after it reached eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Gives Place to Debate
Papimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation
With the periphery prize for the risk and uncertainty that prevailed in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze, which leads to the withdrawal from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new Transitional Government of Eldo is imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papidimos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon on his appointment might not be enough for them to be applied, Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, assured that he would not support new strict economy measures in any case and reiterated his demand for the new elections appointed on 19 February.
The main task of the Government was to follow up on the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, and said Papidimos yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that would culminate in tomorrow ' s confidence in the new executive power.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
But Samaras' message does not clarify his position: “We are prepared to help the Transitional Government, but we do not promise anything.”
The Conservative Leader has taken one step more step in his moods with regard to the EU and IMF, organizations that are expected to freeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not endorse any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still being irritated by the effect of the Paandreu referendum's allegations in style or nothing, repeated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume assistance unless the new Government and the leaders of the major Greek parties signed “a written agreement without any ambiguities and as soon as possible”.
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the troika inspectors could return “very soon” to Athens to discuss with the new Government “which must be done to pay the sixth trench” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been marked.
There's enough thread in the Greek jersey for a while.
Ms. Sofia: “These are tools of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed Spain's “core” place with regard to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in microfinance worldwide”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the last two decades, the country had become the second largest donor of cooperation instruments, “the substance”, she said, that it was “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humankind based on faith in human beings”.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that there is “no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “in particular to halve the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the `tremble poverty' is recorded”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with “responsibility”, says the daughter of Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially women, the principal recipients of these loans”.
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face”.
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a forum for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty had thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from those financial services and that 100 million of those households would be displaced from the poverty into which they were trapped.
The momentum towards establishing a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “went on the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus emphasized to Ms. Sofia as “the act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as “a remarkable idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy locally.
This experience took over a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “all over I have seen continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose link to this project brought her yesterday the title “heads of the family” collected in Valladolid as “a bank of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“The ethical imperative”
The Foreign Minister of Trinidad, Jiménez, said that solidarity was “the ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it was a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit involves a “serious and firm course towards poverty eradication”, and that now “more than ever” Governments of developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and prevent it from becoming a victim of cost reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended the “success” in giving people “secretty” to the“losts to which all doors are closed” and Mayor Valladolid Francisco Javier de la Riva welcomed all present in the city, who “opens his doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
The CDC proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal vote
On Monday, 14 November, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CLM) in Leipzig took place without major problems for the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is also Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but arose in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with respect to Greece and possibly tomorrow with respect to Italy....
The draft resolution on the chairmanship of the European Commission, which had been put forward by management, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The waitovers, which continued for several minutes, deserved their presentations by Angel Merkel and, several hours later, by Wolfgang Schoile, Europhile and Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “no less than Europe but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
"It's time for the chancellor to make a breakthrough in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty that would make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policies of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to give Europe a face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, which is apparently the idea of Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain is opposed, and CDC leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each member country of the European Union in the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kola, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of the “small” European countries or countries in distress who loved to criticize “high” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted a whole paragraph to the importance of the German-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Only by passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating attacks by the Napoleonn army.
What is hospital fraud?
Following cash benefits, UMP and the Government began to attack hospital beds.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit fund and address the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
In order to help this attack, which has emerged from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the right-wing campaign to re-election as presidents, most want to focus on hospital beds.
In view of the budget savings, the Government intended to impose on private company employees the fourth day of unpaid leave prior to payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker would lose a four-day salary equal to a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to give rise to a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
This will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, imposing one day on public servants without payment of sickness benefits (public employees have not yet had to wait for payment of the benefit, as opposed to three days of waiting by private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority are also raising the issue of fraud again, with regard to abuse in the issuance of sick leaves.
Control will become more rigid and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all payments you have received illegally," warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the impact of the statement has been somewhat disproportionate to actual abuse of sick leaves.
They have indeed been subjected to constant control and political attacks since 2002, which bear fruit.
People in France are no more hurt than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a look at the figures across the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 of Euro113,000 million accounted for 5% of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were maternity leave and work accidents and 54 per cent were sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditure was.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management website, found that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said they had not taken a day to hospital.
Another study on health insurance claims that in 2010 37 per cent of hospital patients lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to 1 month, 15 per cent from 1 to 3 months and 11 per cent longer.
If you compare these figures with those of European neighbours, you can see that French workers are no longer more likely to be sick than those of any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from CNRS found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall proportion of absenteeism in France (for reasons of health or not) varied between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital fraud is very low compared to “serious” employment.
On the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in a systematic check of patients for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million reported cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term cases were “unjustified” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked sick leaves for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of cases out of 1.2 million were “unappropriate or unfounded”, which is 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were “unjustifiable” for several million hospital workers.
Figures that show very few cases compared with, for example, grey employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tiana, author of the June report, these amounts to between Euro9 million and Euro15,000 per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November in Parliament by Prime Minister Lucas Papapimos, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government were insufficient to carry out this task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme”, said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on an eve of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be a “core task” of the new Government, since “the presence of the country in the Eurozone” was at stake, he added.
Accordingly, Papimos predicts a decline in the country's fiscal deficit “up to 9 per cent” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Right Rejects the Action of the New Government
On Monday, Antónis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of strict economy.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also opposed any course that prevented economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that IMF and EU would not release the necessary credit of Euro8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide must be legalized with outside assistance, and a committee of experts must report to the Committee of Experts.
Canadians are denied death, as confirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, and this does not include cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code to allow suicide with outside assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
The experts start by referring to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in its 10th place, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people fear to argue on the subject of death”.
Because of medical treatment or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
The country's highest rate is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and external suicide, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the Penal Code with regard to euthanasia and outside suicide.
Now, according to experts, who also examined the position of all countries where such acts had been legalized or decriminalized, there was no evidence that this decriminalization involved abuse of use, i.e., evatansia or suicide with outside help against people who were unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, during the teleconference of Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, most of the cases were in countries where euthanasia and outside suicide were not legalized.
Evtansia is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
Foreign suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to angus Reid ' s 2010 survey, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% think that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is of less value.
With regard to those who assisted with suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation was less clear, said the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that the legal termination of medical care is not an offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the denial of medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal section already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to suppress physical pain like euthanasia and be subject to the same limitations.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legal experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschán, a health law specialist, described the “exceedance” position of experts who signed the report, since, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia in deadly cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who has been over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide, says met three times Dexhan, who discussed yesterday's summary of the report.
Metre Deschamp also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place individual independence above all other values that constituted the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
According to health law specialist Margaret Somerville, “the categorist disagrees with the findings of the report, which she described as “a manifesto for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, inter alia, the reports concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and external suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give up power
Damascus condemns “conspiracy”
Syria gets more and more isolated
Supporters of Bashar Assad conducted a demonstration yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased against Syria Bashar Assad, who, with Russian support, opposes him and condemns “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Syria ' s neighbours, Turkey and Jordan, applied for President Assad ' s resignation.
King Abdalla II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give up power in Syria, where about forty more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar were to have his country’s roads, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new political phase,” said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country to Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had failed.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and who could not satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, in an attempt to target Syria, a neighbouring country, towards which Turkey was increasingly on the line.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey have taken an increasingly stringent course towards repression in Syria, as noted by Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime armed forces died in the Der ' a area in southern Syria, reporting to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy machine guns at Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During the press conference, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem of Syria stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
He also responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, but he has added, believing that this conspiracy against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requiring the deployment of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Giuppe also spoke in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the 2 November crisis plan, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, referred yesterday to the decision of the League of Arab States as “incorrigible”, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to resolve the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and Italian victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked markets for some time to form his own team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively modest office made up of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, and said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in discussions after meeting with the candidate as Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, said that he would have waited to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote on trust until Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monty ' s submission of a limited list of dozens or close to that ministers to the head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for time.
With “democracy, it takes time to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understanding”.
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicals”.
The new Government would be in operation until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of parliamentary confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, as he entered office, he would work harder to guarantee that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the 2013 budget, despite the strict economy plan adopted in recent months, had required, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian “boss” Emma Marcheglia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country without growth cannot respect the deficits”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented “the change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “a professor” symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “other Italy”, according to the authors.
The longitude of his team is a great unknown thing.
President Napolano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012 Italy was expected to pay off its debt in the amount of Euro200,000 million.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko assisted Iran in developing a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday an American agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to identify this scientist.
During the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the possible military aspect of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which relied heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, had been working for 30 years, “from the 60s onwards, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and involved in the production of synthetic diamonds in the methods of explosion”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company producing nano-alms in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, until his return to Russia
In its report, IAEA refers to “the apparent signs that Iran's development” of a nuclear detonator system“promised the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well but who also informed the Agency that he had been working most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday 2009 - 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent compared with an increase of 13 per cent in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of religiously motivated crimes.
The total number of hate crimes increased very little, according to the FBI, to 6,628, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Since the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes has been increasing again, stresses Human Rights First, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims” and adds an official communication to the organization.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered serious human rights violations”, added Paul Lejandr as one of the leaders of the organization.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, it adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports of hate crimes.”
“Crime of hatred” in federal law is a legacy of the period of civil rights.
This law was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging Twitter site changed the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they monitor, which makes this service look like Facebook.
The new activity tab and other "name" allows you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitters, Internet users whose messages you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible to know if they publish messages if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “at a small percentage of users in August” before being widely used on Monday, AFP announced Twitter secret Caroline Panner.
Twitter, known for a long time as intuitively somewhat confusing and as using rather vague terms (RT for someone else's privacy, #Followfry for recommending tracking other users), mainly by making experienced users feel comfortable, thus opening itself up to a wider audience, providing users with something closer to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation with tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better track certain elements of my Twitter stream, and it's written by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the “golden rule” of the budget
The leadership of the major coalition of social democracies and Christian democracies in Austria decided on Tuesday to write down a budget “golden rule” in the Constitution in order to reduce the fiscal deficit and thus avoid a possible decline in Austria's public credit ratings by rating agencies (troika A).
The chancellor of social democracy, Werner Faimann, personally announced this decision at the end of the Ministerial Council meeting, with Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay were to fall on only one point, with AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest of 3,000 million euros more every year, leading to the argument of Vice-Cunchler and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger from Christian democracies.
Austria is thus meeting the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government have called for a reduction of budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced State accounts through the Constitution or equivalent law.
The ruling adopted by the Austrian Government reminds us of the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt that “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit in the State budget should decrease by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit in the federal State ' s budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like communes, should provide balanced budgets.
The aim is to force public debt to fall below the 60 per cent set out in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esychiko Noda
threatens new exchange-market intervention
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esikhiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct further interventions on the currency market if the yen value continued to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of yen, as explained by Mr. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, yen grew to almost a historic point, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new record of force since 1945.
But since then, yen has been growing constantly, driven by the purchases of investors who see it as “a refuge” in these dark times of economic collapse around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolic plan close to the level of the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces Japanese firms ' foreign earnings when converted to national currency.
“Japan fights to restore itself” after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohocu region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that the increase in yen would kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world’s third largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter of -1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect “Japan's fundamental economic performance”.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Adzumi, called upon the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its two-day monetary policy board meeting on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “relevant steps” to understand that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (EUR 47,000 million) by up to 55,000 million yen (€519,000 million) of a ceiling for the purchase of various financial instruments to fill the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates are increasing, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of debt crisis infection undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, the rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left for Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m. CAC, 40 lost 1.4 per cent and graduated at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% while London fell by 0.1%.
Owing to the new difficulties in lending to difficult eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
“Requiring investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection”, explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has looked at Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," states Mitushige Akino, fund manager at Ichioshi Investment Management.
This return of concern over the future of the eurozone continues to fall in a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the departure of the Chancellor Party, Angela Merkel CDM, on Monday, which adopted a resolution, inter alia, providing for an opportunity for a difficult country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85 per cent, and Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity date.
These difficulties, with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked for time from the exchange to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under the weight of his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Padapimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was under attack by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The interest rates between the 10-year debt of Germany and Spain have reached a new historic peak.
Waiting for Eurozone growth
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee has, however, been revised towards a reduction in the number of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about quarter four.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after brief discussion or emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a cause for reflection on the fate and place occupied by nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options have been examined.
France must base its views on objective facts and on rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity at all times, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance, a theme that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic, Finland, Finland, Poland, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are few of those who are resolutely continuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one installation after Fukushima to its kit by re-establishing the construction of a station that had been interrupted following the Tri Mail Island accident.
Although the German renewable energy model sometimes cited as an example, the validity contradicted this argument.
Berlin's choice will be the result of an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, for carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be discernible.
We should consider Daniel’s example.
The European turbine champion, which gives it 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest coal and gas user due to the interrupting wind; hence carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 percent more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and serviceability of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a great increase in the cost of electricity, which will give illusions of beauty to our country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of the country has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole tribe of specialized international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved into another sector.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros per year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order the EPR to work for sixty years if it was planned to close its manufacturer?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low-carbon solutions , nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that controls the existing energy centres, such as Flamandville, without compromise and transparency.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same obsession with security.
The nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents for 50 years.
Only one, Tri-Mail Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but with no human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, the reactor structure and the inexcusable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the two natural disasters of unprecedented force have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from the accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all power specialists who wish to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors Arva and EDF, clearing the way for them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is also legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow our country ' s emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized on various sides: the trans-shipment of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate figures and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a “State of Human Rights”.
Then came the administrative harassment of foreign students, who came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right-hand side and the left-hand side strongly agree on this matter.
On the right-hand side, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers”, but on the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France could “not accept the poor from all over the world”.
Differences in the level of generosity only
In 2005, both the left and the right were afraid of incursion into the country by Polish plumber.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will grant to immigrants.
In his programme, François Alland was limited to banalism, saying that "cooperation will solve our problem of immigration."
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem may have an electorate advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffry Cameron remind us in a recent book on immigration (Special People: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University publication, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in host countries.
Restriction of immigration leads to declining growth and lowers employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the assumption that they can replace local workers, especially those who are less skilled, and lead to lower wages.
But experience has shown that immigrants are far more likely to complement local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
Positive effect on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity existing between local and immigrant communities has led to a positive impact on the salaries of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1 per cent increase in migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This is in the absence of the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all based on immigrants).
Migrants also generate net social security benefits, giving an average of 1 per cent of the overall European budgets.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who has arrived at the age of 30 will earn a net profit (incomes less expenses) on average 150,000 euros for his or her life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was about to get caught up in the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to scare immigrants, have had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy and remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time, it is fragile.
The European continent must recall that by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century, it had experienced tragedies I of the World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Guaga, and Franco in Spain, Sallasar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that it was sufficient for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies to vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, the Little One knows that this is from the surface of the mind.
The universal vote, although a condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can even become a “tool of repression”, as Etienne Vostro once said.
No, democracy requires many other things — public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all a political crisis and a democracy crisis.
In this regard, the pallinody of the true-lived Greek referendum will have a double-deploying effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and incoherence.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong direction.
We will win nothing by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in chaotic order.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a jump with bound feet in the void of nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream, not of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous implementation - of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and how many more will have to be listed is unknown, because there is only one crisis: the European crisis.
Europe as a whole is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, its weaknesses and its lack of solidarity.
Europe is entirely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, and each of its nations along with it.
The management of the European project under popular sovereignty must be restored as a matter of urgency.
Because Europeans can only work together to reduce everyone's debt burden, get rid of markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Breaking the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without leading to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delor, everything now demands the European Economic Government.
That's right.
But to represent it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into play is another madness and a new impasse.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, we had to “make” the Republicans.
Revolutions of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe, which is united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
The online chips are spreading more and more.
The World Flash Card Exhibition is open on Tuesday at Wilpent, Paris, in a spirit of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end at 11% of the increase in world sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards) by over 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important feature of the termless technology sector is to pay for public transport or purchases by simply mapping the reading device.
This year the world will sell 460 million online chips, compared with 320 million earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world map market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which had long lagged behind Asia and the Pacific, was moving forward in the area of indefinite payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 terminals are accepted.
France is starting from a more modest position: there are 40,000 no-cursor Visa maps.
But big shops are increasing speed.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million wireless Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks must provide equipment for their clients.
“Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their clients bank cards for indefinite use,” said Gerard Nebui, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments by means of a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of future development of the means of payment, i.e. the mobile phone.
So far, few machines are equipped with NFC technology (passing-field communication) necessary for such transactions.
"They were put off.
"But they should actually fly away next year."
"We are counting on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhones of some 200 clients and staff will be provided with Czechs that provide no-currency payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And Société Générale said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to enable his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Magriba and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing connections between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Magribe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now convinced of that.
“The way in which these two organizations use and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without resorting to details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger in January identified two link points.
The kidnappings at the Niamey restaurant were apparently carried out by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokour and Wensan Deloi on the following day, together with several of the abductions during an operation conducted by the French special forces.
Among the wreckages left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sim maps belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
An analysis of the calls was made of several interlocutors who were in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who lived long in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram, and the other is said to be close to Aqmi and a sect.
“It's a step forward, but it's certainly better to wait for more reliable evidence than to talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and ideal support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, D.C., is now exerting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of educated people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at mosque, school and imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yousuf, Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sin", preachs the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It was politicized and demanded strict respect for the Sharia, and its activists began to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boco Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uncommitted.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yousuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go out of its northern arms.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Joce, followed by another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boco Haram launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the field office of the United Nations would be their first international objective.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which flows from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Al-Shabaab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram presents a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a discussion with Presidents Gudlak Jonathan Alain Giuppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his readiness to share all available information.
The world as seen by republican presidential candidates
With respect to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by crisis, lead a complex world with simple and, more precisely, simple ideas?
If you heard presidential candidates from the Republicans, the voters could believe it.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have multiplied loud but lacking detailed statements on foreign policy, which are traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and Israeli assistance are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of offering the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint with the Chinese at WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, which is an angry migration of its entire industry to Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate to deal with complex foreign policy, failed to overcome an emotional attitude.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who's in the lower part of the ratings, was left unheard of.
Reagan style
Romni also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I'll stop Iran," he told me.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of not fulfilling his promises to that partner.
A businessman named Herman Kane, second in the candidate's rating, showed a disheartening ignorance.
He had recently called for resistance to the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power — obviously not knowing that China had already had it since 1964!
The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says that he is ready to use the United States army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Kane, Perry and candidate Michel Bahman also recommend torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republic candidate John McCaine, the heavy weight of foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of “children” from Iraq, his schemes in Libya, which brought him a reputation for weak politics.
But the offensive is not that simple.
The population considers the national security balance at Obama to be positive, which has eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention, which is tied in sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to re-establish its leadership, Obama is right.
North Trend, new gate for Russian gas entry to Europe.
The North Flow gas pipeline, linking Western Europe and Russia directly to the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to provide 30 million households with gas equivalents.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra and the ornaments, at the opening of the North Flow, and a new gas pipeline, which directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiion, and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rütte, together returned a symbolic valve to control Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
A new gas pipeline of 275,000 million additional cubic metres of gas will flow every year to Western Europe on the first pipeline of 1,224 km long linking Leningrad region to Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to France ' s total consumption.
The possibility of constructing a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream would indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will find it more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to shut down Western European markets.
At the most tense moment in the Warsaw debate, there was no stop at the North Potok comparison with the new German-Sovet Pact, which was intended to be a union between Hitler and Stalin, with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
That means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of Europe's energy deprivation, because the project created a gate between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already in the process of reaching their destination.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that links us in an organic way," said François Fión, opening up the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the heads of Gazprom, who were present at a large quantity in Ljubmin, the gas destination.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine is made of steel in concrete to protect it from anchor ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the minefields left behind since the Second World War had to be bypassed.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, Spokesperson of North Trek.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
Pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, with no gaps throughout its length, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform had been planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers had abandoned it because Sweden was not pleased that the Russian state company would live on its coast forever.
"In the event of an accident, we shall close the flow of gas in less than a minute," J. Müller claims.
So if you leak the gas in the gas pipeline, it's going to go into the air.
But it seems unlikely that designers have designed silks designed only once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the gas pipeline will be controlled by an underwater robot that pulls the vessel out for external observation, as well as by a vehicle that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
A cigarette-shaped machine shall be injected inside the pipeline 1 m in diameter and pushed forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information on any metal distortion.
The gas pipeline has been designed for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
The gas shall be recycled only at the expense of pressure.
It consists of 200 bars on delivery and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out this project.
Gasprom, which owns 51 per cent of capital, remains the leader.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent).
These five companies have established a joint venture called the North Stream, which was tasked with building and operating a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Tsuga in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gasprom then leased this company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the full volume of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for the full amount, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” claims Jens Müller.
The construction of a gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent shareholders and by 70 per cent bank loans.
The total cost of work would amount to Euro74 million for two pipelines.
GDF Suez investments will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay off their costs because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
Gas pipelines come from the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin to a sandy shore planted by spruce trees.
The vents of 4.5 meters high form the gas output terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brand notepad
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return to the taste of writing.
He's got a smell of adventures, hours spent in writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notepad is easy to find out on a rectangular black cover, on a rubber, on yellow and white pages, as if yellow over time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo Modo, who is in Milan, decided to sell designer notebooks.
Maria Ceborgundi, then consultant to the company, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The notepad is inspired by old production techniques, mollusk, latted cotton cloth, used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskin brought into line with today's taste an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for Vanguard artists until the twentieth century," said Maria Cebreganda, who has since become the manager brand in Modo Modo.
Success has come.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent to 12.7 million.
We are far from producing the first few years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
The typical buyer's profile is hard to establish because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student and a man of free profession alike.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and educated.
A small Italian company, initially with only 12 employees, now has 100 offices and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks at Fnac bookshops, shops in small towns centres and has been able to become widely known.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the arrival of e-mail”, explains Maria Cebregundi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, a brand organized an exhibition entitled “Chicken Road”, where architects and artists displayed their own notebooks.
In August, he also set up a leopard cover on the occasion of a film festival in Locarno.
Using his success and his cultural aura, Moleskine presented his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and the brand includes all kinds of support.
Success that led to jealousy: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syncegra Capital, who wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among workers with disabilities so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for employment.
The 15th week of work for persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the policy of public philanthropy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, namely, 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Sucks?
“No,” says Eric Blance, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of work for disabled persons.”
“A great deal of progress has been made over the past 15 years.”
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times higher."
"One day there's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are over 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent have no bachelor ' s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, accounting for 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and which are the core of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about the mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study by IMS-Entreprendre, commissioned by Cité, in April, found that interviewees had a low level of knowledge of disability and “proceeded to represent entire people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled persons”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of workers with disabilities set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
“We're about 3% today”, says Pierre Blance, director general of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that fail to comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxed” organizations, like the amounts paid, declined from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 tax law, which raised taxes, put strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
“But this improvement also reflects increased consciousness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness."
Eden Azar and Georges Lakeens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45).
We won't get to the point that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Standing next to the front of the Arena of Stade de France, Georges Lakeens and Eden Azar made peace.
Five months after leaving his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden and his progress and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go further," Lille says.
As to the contrast between his achievements in the club and his collection, it is one whole, he is justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, and Belgium isn't."
"I have to make glasses."
Left on reserve, in front of this match with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to St. Deni to finally "blot".
Not forgetting, however, the notion of “satisfaction”.
He has supported the Blues since they were 7 years old and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the special character of this match.
He remembers that on the other side is Mother, Johan, and Adil.
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness."
Lexens kindly remembered pride.
"House" playing "glorious match."
"Hodness" also claims as "neighbor" that France has become "a very high-level team again" just one year after the Naise injury.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, admired by him.
Now that Belgium has missed the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in one plane with blue management... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see it in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal is starting its counter match against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality on their way to him.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Benta already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Council, which has been running since September 2010, is classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes happy.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia has to be won.
Given the 0-0 Friday in Hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal has dominated the match for more than an hour, it has failed to achieve the willful goal of calming it.
"It is a good result, however, which carries some risk."
But at their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which must be a delight, even though the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but reasonable Benta.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of getting on Euro 2012," was the subject of the successor, Carlos Keiros.
On Friday night in the match against Bosnia, the Portuguese are required to win.
No one could make Bosniacs.
"It's a good outcome, but there's some risk, I'm sorry, Benta.
"We'll play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and who has a lot of personal merit," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "don't give them time to think."
It's a good idea if only this time it's realistic.
