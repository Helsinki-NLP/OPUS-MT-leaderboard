Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and the district
Previously, one of those hanged had attempted suicide.
On October 30, about 1 to 00, in the village of Lugova, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He was known to have tried suicide before.
What moved the man to do that is unknown.
On 31 October, at 11 to 50, he lost his life by hanging a 41-year-old man living in Quineshma.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service “Kinsema”.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the disintegrated highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box carefully fitted to your car's instrument panel.
These devices, which track and transmit this information to each mileage official, are at the heart of the controversial attempt to modernize the outdated system of financing America ' s highways adopted by Washington State and State planning bodies.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena produced intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the Government to use small testicles to track the number of miles you are passing and possibly even where you drive them, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
It's a shock to have tea.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
Although Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states do not intend to wait.
They reflect on how they can move to a system during the next decade where drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have satellite tracking functions.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“It is not a question on which we may have a choice”, said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Association of Southern California Governments, who is preparing plans to begin tracking by state authorities the miles that each California motorist is passing by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
There's already technology for that.
This is compounded by the lack of funding from the Government ' s highway fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans at the gas station.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive more miles per hallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per hallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise taxes by even one cent at high prices of gasoline.
“The tax on gasoline cannot be kept”, said Lee Mannich, transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
In his state, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed on his vehicles to test the tax system.
“This will be the best option in the long term”, he said.
Weasels call it a false user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change travel patterns to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning bodies in California are looking at this system in the course of developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state ' s ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives of Bill Schuester (Republicr, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason's free market entrants are also thrilled to have drivers pay for every mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go into the black hole”, said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called for Congress to move in the direction of the tax.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the House leaders rejected this proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to town.
Several states and cities are nevertheless on their own.
The largest enthusiasm is found in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mile to run instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has been completed.
In New York, it's under consideration.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes transport departments of 17 Eastern Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor each step.
“The concern about the big brother and such things is a major problem”, said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult search for low-cost technology is under way to enable state authorities to keep track of the miles by car, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, said Khan, society will feel more secure.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Milage.
Initially, this company did not cooperate in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing car insurance market, where drivers pay on the basis of a run.
But the devices it tests attracts road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so unless you are tracking their speed and position,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Milage.
There were a few major errors in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device from or without GPS.
Or they can totally abandon the device by choosing instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all the state residents pass.
In other places it is hoped to sell the idea to the alert public by putting devices to do more than or less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax-driven device that will also accept payment by parking counters, provide “payments as you drive” to the insurance company and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers who could be used by motorists to avoid traffic.
“Autobilists will benefit from participation,” states the urban design document.
Some transport designers, however, are wondering whether all false pay talk is simply a huge distraction.
In the city Gulf Transport Commission of San Francisco, officials say that Congress could easily have overcome the bankruptcy of the highway construction trust fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is accept aspirin,” said Randy Rantschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan for the provision of gas to Ukraine, as well as an agreement with IMF on emergency credit, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
Credit negotiations are under way with IMF and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations has added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential credit from IMF, Ukraine could obtain 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubted that Ukraine and IMF were able to overcome long-standing differences on terms of funding.
I don't believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to obtain assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday to “B-” with “B”.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a contingency option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now leaving Russia.
This may be the gas from the "North Flow" or the turns from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most feasible and acceptable way in which Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and will probably lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“Each EU country and Ukrainian is negotiating how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but on other routes”, added Reuters source.
Russia Beyond Urban Pollution Control
Efforts to solve the transport problems of major cities have occurred in most of the megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
It was generally about either their restructuring and expansion or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is well known for having imposed strict quotas for the growth of private vehicles and for their acquisition being purchased on auctions.
Its price may be two or three times that of its own car.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a specific ecoclass are allowed to enter, using also high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” with a total value of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
As described by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Lee Kunscheng, the main objective of the five-year period is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increase in the number of private vehicles to no greater than 6 million (at present 5.2 million), and increase by not more than 5 per cent in the use of fuel per vehicle.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include limiting the use of road transport as well as introducing additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban “green-five-year-old” measures include an accelerated transition from the rest of the country to Euro-fuels, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuels, restrictions on the entry of vehicles into the central part of the city, prohibition of the use of obsolete vehicles (including the establishment of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old vehicles for hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed vehicles).
Road innovation in Beijing also includes a ban on all private motor vehicles within the fifth transport ring (all of them six in the PRC capital) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle registration plate) as well as the issuance of registration plates for lottery-based vehicles (e.g. 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private vehicles in Beijing was only one third of 2010.
According to the current State programme “Environmental protection 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, 41 per cent of all city air pollutants were released in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times.
In the Russian Federation, the possibilities for restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities have just begun to be considered.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the WEE, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are known to be unpopular and can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive vehicles - service and personal vehicles, as well as “acquired” users, with a total capacity of not less than 200,000 (about 5% of the total Moscow fleet).
On the day before, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers are that the city centre is twice as well provided by roads and that most motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on parking lots or on the streets for long periods of time.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parking lots, but automobile storage facilities, but to reduce the carriageway (so that the streets become more friendly to pedestrians) and to restrict the use and location of personal transport at the borders of the protection zone of the historic centre (a total area of some 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
The fines for unauthorized street trade in Vodda will increase at a rate of
In the view of the urban authorities, the increase in fines will help to bring order to Vogda and free the streets of natural tents and trays.
Most street dealers do not pay taxes, the products they produce often do not have a related sanitary control.
This means that wet people are at risk.
For example, the lower penalty for unauthorized trade for citizens will increase sixfold from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles from November to 3000 roubles, and report to the press service of the Vodda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of unpaid consumer credit and massive reductions in employees.
Our main concern now is, not that growth has slowed, but rather that growth structure.
Recently, it has been fully attributable to consumption, which is almost non-performing," stated chief economist Goldman Sachs on Russia, Clemens Graffe, presenting yesterday’s quarterly report on the Russian economy.
The nominal increase in wages in Russia is now around 10%.
With 6 per cent inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately current levels, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent, explained Mr. Graphe.
Companies have experienced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it can lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, comments Chief Economist Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment near historical limits, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to lure or hold back current employees.
The consumption of support in Russia is living up to a very rapid increase in the need for credit.
According to Mr. Graphe, because of the very high rates of consumer loans, this type of credit has no multiplicative effect on the economy.
"The benefits to the economy from increasing consumption of credit have not been seen, the money is not distributed by the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in the delay on insecure loans.
They are mainly taken by small people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently," Mr. Graf noted.
The second threat to the growth of the Russian economy is therefore a possible crisis of unpaid loans.
The Director of the WSE Banking Institute, Vasily Sweetkov, is already witnessing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources, which is available from public banks, have been forced to attract funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, the bankers went on a path of war and began to lower credit rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations may not issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have negative interest rates.
If women don't give up the dumping, Russia is threatened by a full-fledged banking crisis, says Vassili Sweetkov.
The exclusion of a number of banks in recent weeks is considered by economists to be a predictor of mass collapse.
“The bankers themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the institute.
But the increase in consumption will slow down, and without a crisis of non-payments, the investment is believed to be due to the non-indexization of public and military salaries in the current version of the budget.
The partial impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisites are not yet available - see certificate), consumption growth will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has yet to see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The major risk is still the drop in oil prices," he said.
He estimated that Russia's economy would begin to decline at a price of oil below $90/barr.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB was not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradox: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise stakes.
That might mean they didn't believe the CB that had declared the transition to inflation," said Clemens Graff.
The cent policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, and only affects inter-bank lending rates.
"For the CB, it's a failure of all hope," answered Clemens Count.
CB auction money, banks are not used for lending the economy, but for managing their liquidity.
Once the rate goes down, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the ruble.
“Early or later, the CB will understand that the strategy is not working”, said Mr. Graf and recalled that the State is planning to turn the ruble into “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But you're either going to have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
He estimates that the ruble course is currently artificially overstated by 10%.
I'm only driving one road, weak, making the expert's conclusion.
But if the CB loses even the shadow of doubt in the finances that the closing down of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of reducing the ruble, it could break the rouble much more.
The second meeting of the peoples of Southern Ural took place in Chelabinsk.
The Forum is in conjunction with the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all towns and regions of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious faiths, legislative and executive bodies, and a total of about 350 persons.
The Forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We have no differences and no differences.
“ We live in full harmony, ” Féofan says, Mythropolitan Chelabinski and Zlatoststan.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
Following the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued at the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations in Chelabin Province was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence detector, said that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about his activities.
German deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snouden, who was presented by the deputy to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, informed Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that NSA had listened to the Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy in charge of the parliamentary group responsible for intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snouden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States in its entirety”, it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, a member of Parliament from the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to counsel from former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there “safe”, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “hard and sustained” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the world's reaction to “his political speech”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including those in the United States — saw the exposure of an uncontrolled system of universal surveillance as beneficial to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the humanitarian situation is resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for manual laying
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for hand-cuffing their flight.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging up to $100 for manual storage and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new hand-load fee applies to the bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said that he would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers paid only when they were on board.
Frontier Kate O'Malley said that $100 pay should make passengers care for payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for it,” she said.
The airlines began to charge for the first and second bags delivered in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges are packed as much as they can in the hand-cuffed luggage compartments, which often results in a shortage of space in these compartments.
Prearrangements are one way to force passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection wasn't really for money.
The fact is, the most loyal Frontier clients say it's getting harder to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight can pass the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and in the Frontier registrations is intended to guarantee that passengers will know about the fee before they land.
The new Frontier manual fee does not start to be charged until summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual laying fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual fee three years ago, and yet another Allegiant Air discotheque later followed her example.
The only other airline with this charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, said an airline consultant, Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the supplemental charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit was paying 50 million dollars a year to pay his hand.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown the Spirit flight, and he was curious to find out what he would find at the exit when passengers encountered an unusual collection of Spirit for manual laying.
“The landing process was the smoothest of what I had seen in my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a tooth gnash and a fight on the way out.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing was fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit with respect to $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice could keep the entire bank and that the coffee industry would be provided free of charge.
It will continue to provide water free of charge.
The US Airways tried to charge a drink fee for 2008 for a short time, but declined seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airline had followed her example.
The Frontier Manual Cargo Initiative, where passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest effort to attract customers to their website.
Air companies pay tickets to online salesmen, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than resort to a tourist online company.
But Frontier went beyond everyone else in this field.
In September, she started to give twice as much bonus miles to a frequent passenger to customers who had bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the predominant number of miles to 25 percent of the miles.
For example, a 1,000 - mile [1,000 km] trip from Frontline, purchased from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers may only be selected in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontline website.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is declining and her business is becoming lost.
The profits decreased by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to a financial outcome published by Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finance as part of the airline sale.
NSA blames "internal error", not hackers for closing down the site.
The clandestine National Security Agency announced on Friday evening that the end of their website had caused a technical breakdown for several hours, not hackers, as had been alleged online.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening because of the internal error that occurred during the scheduled update”, reported the intelligence agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the disruption was caused by a distributed “service denial” [DoS] attack were incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not been operating for at least six hours and that the site was still not available to some users.
The NSA representative previously informed ABC News that the internal secret network of the “no” agency had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, he reported.
At least one online group of hacker activists stated that it was responsible for disrupting the NSA site through DDoS attacks.
The DDoS attacks are designed to fill the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is broken.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple and attacks are not intended to enter the target system's internal network.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, formerly named “No such Agency”, has been at the centre of public attention and severe criticism in recent months following the discovery of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of which are reactions to the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former NSA official Edward Snoden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to the impression that today's incident was the result of deliberate hackers' actions.
Bombardier's arrivals are declining, with supply and number of aircraft orders falling.
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 per cent reduction in net profits due to a decrease in the number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Bombardier, a Montreal-based company, also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft would be implemented by next September.
Following the first pilot flight of an aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only flew three more times, raising questions as to whether the test stage was on schedule.
The results failed to meet projections and led to a decline of more than 8 per cent in shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doercsen, analyst National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate on Thursday from “above medium-term” to “mederal” because of the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decrease in the number of aircraft delivered was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the rate of return of the Transport Division,” said Dorksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as the summer test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominant.
The first test sample of an aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not yet too many to 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify company ' s allegations of fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would reach its goal of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operations.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” said Boduan during a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades were planned for the time of the fixed-wing aircraft.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the renewal, so we did.
This will take place throughout the entire flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to take place in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first client would be able to start operating on the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the period of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow rate of summer testing - although apparently consistent with the internal Bambardier schedule - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015,” said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, Bombardier's net income decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted equity gains remained the same — 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and gross income $4.5.6 billion, according to Tomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 fixed-wing aircraft.
The aviation office's portfolio of orders amounted to $32.9 billion by 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“In the aviation field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the small number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor”, said Boduan.
Gross aviation revenue fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, world’s largest train producer, reported that gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit's portfolio of orders was $32.6 billion by 30 September, slightly higher than that of 31 December.
The income of the transport unit has been adversely affected by the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that the head finance manager of Google Patrick Pichett would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4,83 in bids in mid-April.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial airline manufacturer and closest competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, had completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the current financial year's income forecast.
Sony ' s results from July to September 2013 were more disheartening than expected, owing to the falling demand for television, video cameras and personal computers of Japanese corporation production.
Sony's television business, the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the second quarter, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operational loss during the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through difficult times, especially as a result of reduced demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its emphasis on industrial hardware: the sale of companies is increasing at a high rate, especially through road systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operational gains against the expected 230 billion yen earlier.
However, according to Yomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be much higher and would be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced that the sale of smart hours from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashion functions would eliminate the need to deliver a smartphone 100 times a day from its pocket.
After Sony reduced the annual income and profit forecast, the company's shares in opening torts in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The genus of speech was the stimulant of synapses
Scientists at John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that enables Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and its summary can be found on the magazine’s website.
The gene Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by finding a family of several who were unable to speak correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have lost the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions are performed as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain related to speech formation.
This is done by another gene, SSRPX2.
The latter was identified as a result of the search for factors that encourage synapses.
SSRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 was the only reason for its activity.
The fact that SSRPX2 really affects the collation has been confirmed by scientists in the muscle experiment.
When animals had artificially reduced gene activity, they cried less when separated from their mother.
If the gene’s activity was restored, the frequency of produced sounds was restored.
Previously, mice also showed the connection to Foxp2 itself.
The animals, who were given a human copy of the gene, were more active and at a lower frequency than the normal mice.
So far, however, scientists have not known whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, its SSRPX2 is linked to the purely "mechanical" properties of the formation of sound or thinr processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of the criminal group of police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be solved
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The lawyer, who told the drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta sent secret information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough on his investigation of drug trafficking activities after he was threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash was arrested at his home in 2011 after the Scarboro police surveillance operation he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that the 32-year-old Scarborough had left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County Lancashire while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Diett was “regularly using” a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
During eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain information illegally on the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at that time as part of a major investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merciside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were subsequently imprisoned after a series of raids of heroin and cocaine worth ?1.5 million and more than ? 200 thousand in cash.
A 42-year-old, Ditta transmitted information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be solved.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, which works with Forbes Policyors, located in Blackburn, was covered with shame after his guilt had been found guilty in two cases of deliberate interference with the administration of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer ' s release took place after the Scarboro police investigation found that he had been on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and discovered how he came up to Diett's house in Blackburn and placed drugs with 60 percent purity in a black golf gloves under a lawyer's garbage case.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough met many times with Ditt, who was at the soccer stadium of Iwood Park, Blackburn Rover.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Dietta had been using cocaine “regularly” after tests had found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
The child was later arrested but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and insisted on their association being “Avocata secret”.
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
During the police interrogation, he said that, along with his work place, he had a home office and customers came to his home in legal matters.
The court learned, however, that after important arrests, he had called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them what the detectives knew.
Ann White, in the indictment, said: “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is a lawyer in criminal matters.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position by a criminal lawyer, as he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legal, as he was their lawyer.
This, however, greatly exceeded the normal relationship of counsel and client.
He obstructed police investigations as much as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but shamed it.
He had come too close to certain customers, such as Scarborough, and had allowed himself to question his lack of interest.
The child did not confess guilt and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and I would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do so immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holsted of the Lancashire Police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal criminal lawyer as soon as he starts to buy drugs from organized crime”.
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purpose of leading criminal groups, which have entrusted him with obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt ' s investigation was led by the Lancashire unit on particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now to obstruct the administration of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough itself was convicted 14 years after guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons who participated in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On its web site, Ditta organized a question - and - answer discussion in which he says that his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, his perfect companion for dinner is Mohammed Ali, and his motivation for work is inequality.
The Yaroslavla stadium was not ready for 22,000 visitors, and police officers were present at the FRF meeting today.
The ticket program is, in their view, approximately twice as high.
During the 1/16 game, the Russian Cup and Spartacus were used by only a thousand stewards at a standard of 9,000.
Spartacow fans had 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium capacity, but under agreement with the Moscow Club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was read by the head of KDC, Arthur Grigorianz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the U.S. intelligence officers, who preferred not to reveal his name, said that the States had been listening to telephone calls from high-ranking officials in Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several listening points in the land of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not carry out intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, had been targets for intelligence despite its post-war alliance with Americans, reported the NHK television channel.
This information has not yet been formally commented on by either party.
Remember, the news about the U.S. intelligence office at the FAR chancellor came out last week.
According to German journalists, NSA has been able to listen to Merkel's phone over the past 10 years.
According to some reports, the chancellor himself received news of his wiretap very painfully.
She stated that the Allies she considered to be the FAR and the US for decades were unacceptable for such surveillance of the Head of Government.
However, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share details of the wiretap of Angela Merkel's telephone conversations with the German prosecutor's office.
The Germans made a special visit to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Toweryards can tender grain no sooner than early 2014
The country's agricultural minister, Nicolaus Kovalenko, can produce grain at least until early 2014 at the time of government procurement interventions.
To date, market prices have been such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price on the market is higher, there's demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put out in a bid after New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year ' s crop yields amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including 1.7 million hectares, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
A total of 550,000 ha (an increase of 105,000 ha compared to 2012) was planted in 2014.
The area under winter wheat and triticle has been increased, and the delivery has remained at the same level.
There's no group called "Brat Circle" in the U.S. Leaps.
There's no sign of a singer named Gregory Leps in the databases of Russian militiamen of the group "Bratsky" to which Washington has assigned the singer.
As indicated by Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, all databases were checked by the U.S. Ministry of Finance, Gregory Leps, on the checklists suspected of being part of the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate of the “Brat Circle”, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “Russia Mafia”, which is said to be operating abroad, is regarded as a force structure.
"Even in the very name of 'Brats', there's some element of secrecy, there's a hint on the secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a pyar-act," said the agency's interlocutor.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced the inclusion of Arthur Badalian, Grigory Lepsveride, Vadim Lalin, Sergey Moscalenko, James Rybal and Igor Schlakova on its checklists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate.
Those listed are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Ghafour Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and who have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps is “a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
At the producer centre of Gregory Leps refused to comment on U.S. allegations against the singer, calling them a "brede."
In 2011, President Barack Obama of the United States identified the Sindicate “Bratsk Circle” as “a significant transnational organized criminal group” and directed the mine “to support and prohibit their global criminal operations”.
The blacklisting of the U.S. Minfin has resulted in the freezing of assets in the United States and the ban on business dealings with persons residing in the United States.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and outright reckless show, went to smoke cracks.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video record and were ready to start an investigation against the granter.
He said he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities had evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police website.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement agencies, held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the staff with the public, but for their existence he was employed.
According to Blair, a compromise by Rob Ford, a video was found during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by guards in the summer of 2013.
The existence of this video had previously been reported by the Canadian press, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor himself does not comment on this matter.
He just says it's not his fault and he's not going to retire.
The video recorded by the police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford Alexandre Lisi, a 35-year-old friend who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal proceeds and conspiracy.
At times, Lisi served as driver of Rob Ford.
City dwellers have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought journalists on several occasions, appeared in public in drunken form, and allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
Assmann Beraten + Planen, the German company Assmann Beraten, has been recognized as the winner of the project designer's choice.
The amount of the contract is not disclosed at the Restauróvene.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and under the terms of the tender, the project was to be prepared and sent to State experts in spring 2014.
The winner has to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport upgrading elements.
In the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and it may be further increased.
The project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex by 2025 for about 5 million passengers and 6 million passengers by 2035.
By the time the tender was summarized, an architectural concept for the South Aeronautics complex had been developed by the British company Twelve Archives.
The design of the main terminal represents the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, a company has designed terminals C and E of the International Airport of Sheremitevievo and a new aero-acoustic complex at Knević International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Axay region of the Rostov region and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and will be integrated into the city's construction in the future.
The construction of the aeronautics complex is scheduled to begin in 2014 and the installation of all facilities is scheduled to take place in 2017.
A Turkish politician declared a hunger strike against a wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the Prokur party of the PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aishe Gekhan, who is on the border with Syria, declared a hunger strike protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported to the RIA News in the Press Service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly driven protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction and then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaibina Aishe Gekhan, a member of the GPA, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly battle," said the party's press service.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from one another, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“It is an inhumane situation with which Kurds will never accept”, quoted Aishe Hackhan as party representatives.
According to press services, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will establish a rates of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolifra, vis-à-vis the dollar for tourists.
Bloomberg reported this on 1 November with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers are allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country ' s purchased Bolsheviks at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the miller against the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency up to 6.3 boliar per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 Boliffs.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 per cent of its value.
Inflation in Venezuela amounted to almost 50 per cent in September.
The Minister of the Petroleum Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Raphael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devaluation the Bolívar.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas could still decide to lower the exchange rate following the December municipal elections.
The policy of restraining the prices of products and consumer goods, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, Director of South Africa, noted that it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new major coach.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergei Shepélev.
The resignation was only a few hours ago, so to tell me how much time it takes to find a new coach, I'm not ready, I'm not prepared to say "ITAR-TASS" to Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but to find someone who's going to work in our club for a few years and get some results with him.
The Kenyan press was outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“It is a very harsh and punitive law, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, executive director of the Capital Group, the CapitalFM parent company, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judiciary “will always be biased because it is a continuation of the Government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially enable the Government to “take the media with dead grips” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been “dangerously hit” and criticized the bill as “draconowski”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras where troops who were sent to the attack site are suspected to rob an expensive shopping centre.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, to two journalists and a media official for questioning had been lifted following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists could be fined up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, i.e. a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily National, “even one fine is sufficient to paralyse the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “lived blogosphere”.
Politicians realize that by silenceing the media, they will be able to do their best with impunity.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote journalist Nation Mutum Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balanced power in public life.
“Police on its own will break the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering”, he wrote.
Kenya’s legislators were targets of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing the cuts imposed by the National Wage Commission and restoring their huge salary, which was about 53,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will appear in the community payments of the crows, which will be allocated to major maintenance of the house.
The most approximate estimate for a standard two-room apartment would be between 100 and 400 roubles per month from the new year.
The specific regulations will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the approach, set up ladder cells, or even replace the elevator, the tenants themselves will decide.
This law has been approved by members of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Kolnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: “In this case too, the order must be established - to prioritize houses, to accumulate funds other than the managers of companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, and elsewhere, it will be the establishment of State control over the spending of funds collected by residents for the repair of apartments.”
State-controlled construction is now under the control of the State.
The law protecting against fraud was approved by the wrapper in final reading.
The document was not born empty.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all actors involved in construction.
Vladimir Kolnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: "It's no secret that abuse has also begun in this area, because in the 98th year, the same numbers fell, and in the 2000s, the same numbers of people."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including the two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary stay centre under Voronej for foreign nationals to be deported.
The District Parliament has adopted such a law not only under pressure from the Federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region are at least excommunicated.
In the past year, for example, just over 100,000 foreigners have been taken into account.
But only 1 out of 5 has formalized a work permit.
Where the rest of them work and pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kolnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, said, "They have violated the law but are not criminals."
There's no court, and you have to deport them - they have to be held somewhere.
This decision was taken by the Federation by means of regional means to provide such facilities.
In Voronezh district, this is the old Olshanka Semiluk district.
Well, in the end, the regional parliament has given new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million — but also many children’s savings.
Secondly, and most importantly, housing subsidies will be issued to those who adopt 3 and the younger ones from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
The family, for example, out of six people - the father, the mother, the mother child and the 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires an area of 108 square metres, for 3,000,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or south-west neighbourhood, it's a well-acceptable option.
Well, in the Paradise center, you can buy a whole cottage for that amount.
Baumhertner nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkalia.
The current Board of Directors of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Uralakali, has proposed the appointment of the director of the company, Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, to a new board, and is reported on on the Russian company's website.
Bamgertner was on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list has been prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, at which the new composition of the board of directors will be determined by voting.
Baumhertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
In August of this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
Later, however, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus stated at a press conference that the charges against Baumhertner were re-assigned as “dick-up”.
Matt Dalton's Naphthechemist refused to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's departure as a mentor of the Lower Chambers.
Holkiper believes that the Acting Chief Coach, Dmitri Balmine, has great authority from the players and will handle his responsibilities.
Remember, today, the Naphthechemist has resigned from Cricunov's office.
To be honest, I wouldn't like to comment on Vladimir Cricoon's dismissal, quote Dalton RIA News.
I can only say that Dimitry Balmine will handle his obligations -- I don't doubt that.
He has great authority on his team, and this young professional is definitely looking forward to a great future.
Leonardo Bonucci's defender will not help the team at the nearest Italian championship match with Parma.
According to Footbell Italia, the training staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to save him in front of the fourth round of the team round of the League of Champions with the Real.
Nor will they be associated with Lichtsteiner, Vuchinic and Pepé.
And Forvard Fabio Cwalarella recovered from the trauma and was ready to play.
The journey of fuel will be accompanied by a tax manoeuvre that provides for an increase in the mining tax (FDI) on oil at the same time as export duties fall and excise increases.
In the opinion of the experts, these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyar Court had his ID stolen, striking him in the head.
The unknown attacked the President of the Krasnoyar Regional Court of Vladimir Dvoeconco, stealing his ID.
According to Interfax, late Wednesday night, the abusers hit the judge in the head, causing him to lose consciousness.

U.S. Secretary of State: The special services have sometimes “departed too far” in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and wires, American intelligence services sometimes “went too far”, however, the politician noted that the information on 70 million missing persons in the media was not accurate.
I assure you that innocent people have not been hurt in this process, but the attempt to gather information has been.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unlawful.
I recognize this, as the President recognizes... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future”, cites Secretary AFP.
Italian workers with years of experience are giving way to young people
Italian unemployment is striking record.
Data published on Wednesday show that 12.5 per cent of the population is now unemployed.
So bad has been the case since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15-24 years are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and laws have been enacted to enable regional authorities to provide part of their early retirement pension to older workers.
On the other hand, Italy looks forward to a common European problem for the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
The construction of TNC in Moscow will lead to what
With each passing year, the capital authorities promise to establish more and more transport and relocation units (TRPs).
It is planned to introduce 255 TNCs by 2020.
The project was actually handled by our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence broke out on the Somblensa Metro of Arbatsco-Carean.
The note said that a repositioning facility was in progress.
All of this was very strange, since no land transport is stopped near "Smolen" and therefore cannot be moved to it.
To reach the nearest Trolleybus stop on the Gardening Ring, it is necessary to cross some 130 metres, including a land pass across the Carmanica alley.
It's almost over at Smolenski's.
After a flowering laurel had disappeared, a newspaper stand had been dismantled, and asphalt had been replaced by a barbed before entering.
That's the entire transport unit.
Transport and transplant facilities are flat and capital, as explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
Capital TNCs are not yet available.
The flat floors are designed to construct parking lots, to remove commercial facilities that prevent passenger traffic, to create small architectural structures and improvements.
In fact, the TNCs are not even run by transporters, but by professional planners from the Moscow Capital Repair Department.
The transport unit is not necessarily a complex structure,” explains Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the High School of Economics.
Sometimes there is sufficient shelter above the head and a sign indicating the time of arrival.
For example, on the Yasenevo subway, a fairly full flat transplant node was recently opened.
Let's have no oars, but with interception cars and a plate indicating when the bus comes.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials record everything in the TNC.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build all 151 units, 59 of them with capital.
There are now 255 TNCs in plans up to 2020.
Of these, one and a half promise to surrender as early as this year.
Although there is a programme for the development of TNCs in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, Co-Chair of the civil society organization Cities and Transport.
The number of sites is counted, but the quality of the transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, reduced transplant time; and second, comfort.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without falling into the rain.
In Moscow, with the establishment of the TNC, the opposite is sometimes true.
A great example of the VDH subway.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavian highway came into the Square before the main entrance to the VIC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the streets of Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, much further away from the monorell, but closer to the homes.
For a reason, the residents did not want a car station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
The capital TNCs in Moscow didn't happen at once.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planerna subway.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And actually, there's a model of how the transplant node paid to investors becomes a banking mall.
No, there's some persons for buses, there's a hanging to keep off the subway in the rain, and there's three floors of parking lot.
True, the Chemical Trolleybus No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TNC did not give a place in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
But there's more to trade.
The clothes of 32 shops are the only ones, and there is almost everything from zooves to automobiles.
Well, what if one of the bus passengers had to buy a new car on the road?
When we're building a capital TNC, why is there always a shopping center?
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot decided to market it.
Now, on the third floor of the Plannerna TNC, combat trade is taking place among the floor parking spaces.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-russian speech, and guards who look angrily at our photographer.
The transplant unit finally turned into a market.
The thing is, it used to be marketed at the Planerna subway, but it was dropped.
And in the prefecture, merchants were complained and sent to an interception parking lot.
It's always empty because of high prices.
The funny thing is that the market was pulled down to build in its place... a new flat TNC.
That's how it's rocked.
On the Kaluski subway, the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 meters, ” says Alexander Morrisov.
After the construction of the mall, allegedly TNC, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the shopping mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, we have to go through it in the open sky.
In fact, the design on the Plannerna and the Calusian will soon appear in flowers.
In mid-September, the city and land commission of the mayor approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TNCs.
Four of them will be 25-site, not counting two or three underground lines.
The main monster will grow up in the Tuscino subway, with 418,000 square feet [418,000 sq m] of space.
The representatives of the RWC railway station managers responsible for the construction of the subway TNC have already told journalists that shops, hotels and apartments will be used in future polyethies.
At the same time, officials believe that multi-larlar fences are home to between one third and one half of the square area.
Take, for example, "people's" garages.
Let's say that the garage is 258 cars recently built on the International Street, with an area of 8,015 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 "squares" to park over 2.6 thousand cars in Pietrovsky.
That's less than a third of what's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go on every perlon for buses.
There's at least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate left.
And this, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TNCs are built by railway railway stations at stations and stations, the remaining areas will be developed by the Metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many “functional objects”, including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums.
In fact, in Moscow City's property department, journalists were recently informed that they were drafting a decree that would allow investors to apply for a section for TNC officials directly.
No competitions.
Because I pray that transport is a priority for the city.
The ideal TNC is, for example, Garvard Station in Boston or Predation in Toronto, which is sure of Alexander Christmas.
There, Trolleybuses and trams descend to the ground to the level of the metro, and the approach from the subway train to the tram is only 50 metres without going outside.
There's no more trade around here.
But Moscow officials are extreme.
We're not going to build anything, or we're going to hit 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser suggests that it be equated to extremism with an insult to patriotic feelings
In order to provide legislative protection for the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults against Russia, “Just Russia” suggests that insults of patriotic feelings should be equated with extremist activities and punished for doing so by five years' imprisonment.
As reported in the newspaper Izvedia, such legislative amendments prepared by Oleg Mikheev’s vice-presidentship committee on energy are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of the citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of the person with the country of which he is a national, which is characterized by love for the country, which is responsible for its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
According to Mikheev, there are sanctions in domestic legislation for abuse of the official characteristics of State authority - the flag and the camel.
In the view of parliamentarians, however, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be assailants and insults of State symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country, has not been sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the rising debate day of the year, where some media personnel have allowed themselves to question the heroic exploits of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main popular holiday, the Victory Day of 9 May, is opened every year by a real vacancy.
By learning to be obscenity and “alternative look” in history, some public figures come to the conclusion that it's unfortunate that cultural Germans haven't won the wild Soviet Union!
I think it's completely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main spiritual strength of the nation, and Oleg Mikheev resents it.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are many more patriotic people in Russia than there are religious ones, but the law penalizes insults to the feelings of the believers, and the patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity.
According to the popular electorate, it is necessary to equate the insults of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to state penalties in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The draft provides for punishment for insults to patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-thousands fine to a 5-year sentence.
A magnitude earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the Cokimbo area of central Chile, transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as specified on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website.
The events were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November Moscow).
No casualties or damage caused by underground acts of destruction have yet to be reported.
We will recall that Chile is in one of the most seismoactive areas of the earth, so earthquakes are not rare.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, the magnitude of the earthquake of 8.8 and its tsunami caused more than 550 deaths and the destruction of 220,000 buildings in Chile.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, 9.5 magnetoids were recorded there.
That disaster killed more than 5,000 people.
Dmitri Medvedev: The Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be examined in strict compliance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws”, Dmitri Medvedev said at a meeting with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero of France.
There are French citizens who have been detained by Greenpeace activists.
Pierre Pisan, like other activists, is charged with bullying.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that may cause damage to the environment, no one is entitled to violate the laws”, Dmitri Medvedev stated in turn.
He said that any structure that sought to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, was dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “like a powder barrel” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, passing on the RIA News.
The United Nations has announced new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which were due to expire in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the previous night.
They were included in the outcome document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gilard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the night before to the summit that it was now time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the process of achieving the universal goals of sustainable development — CSD”, he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority vested in me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concern over security in Mozambique is growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the image of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, they have thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scandalize the slogans of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability”, said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed the business suit to a T-shirt decorated with “We Require Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital Square of Independence.
In two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo were reported — one of the most violent encounters since the Truce was held more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a prominent rebel movement supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the Truce of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again face a full-scale conflict, but recent events have caused foreign investors and local residents to become nervous.
The rates are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of large-scale shelf gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Valle from Brazil, Enni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party, Frelimo, the political leader since 1975, and the Renamo Party have accused each other of the tension that has arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the instigator of recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional patronage of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlacama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandu Gebusa has tried to resolve concerns about instability.
Hebusa told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlacama felt like a "lost" who wanted to use "all he had left to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government".
Both Frecimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased following reports of Mazanga ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement by Renamo.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Frelimo Party.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness”, said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has intensified this year ' s series of clashes.
“They are two influential people (Hebusa and Dhlacama) who have met their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections appointed for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of votes in favour of Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by former Renomo member, is expected to improve its performance in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was to resign next year, when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multi-party democracy; he doesn't want transparent elections; he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency”, said Mazanga.
It is not clear what the power of Renamo is, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key highway from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sophala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beiro, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Valle, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Masanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renomo party wanted to “warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique”, said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the Government's frustration and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company at Mediacop.
“People think that the future of the country is the responsibility of the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems”, he said.
Omar Sultuan, who was involved in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo; they just want peace; they want free access to roads,” he said.
A series of pre-session films, "Art Meinstrom", will be held in Moscow.
A series of "Art-Mainstrom" shows where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they go into the channel, and will take place at the "Rolan" cinema from 1 to 5 November, with reference to the project's organizers.
A French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi will open the "Art-Mainstrom" program at any price.
This is a story of the Maye (Sam Kerichi) model in the French capital, which is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also see a new picture of the famous South Korean film director Kim Ki Doek “Mebius”, the melodramatic bike by Oliver Hirschbigel, “Diana: History of Love” (Diana), with Naomi Watts, as the main feature and main film of the May Cannes Film Festival “Liece Adele” Abdeltif Kesisha.
The only Russian participant in "Art-Mainstrom" will win the film by Alexander Wellen's "Geographer" on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's one-name novel.
The main role is that of Víctor S. S. S.
Children must study myths and legends as “models of way of life”, says the author.
The tales of Tore could show that “the grotesque power cannot overcome a subtle trick” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths would be “as wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too indecent for teaching in schools”, Crossley-Holland is in favour of “satisfactory selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it's wonderful that, in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the twenty-year curriculum.
He added that the “extreme morale” of authors and teachers was “resolved” by children and that the main ideas were “supplied” in entertaining stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Belovof from Anglo-Saxon, also wrote "The Council of Norwegian Myths" for the publication of Penguin and "The British People's Tales," said:“You may, of course, have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy outcome, but that there should be an innate understanding of right and wrong.
And that should be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly defined.
Old principle: show, not tell.
In Voronezh district, a football fan was detained, breaking a window in the waiting room.
At 9 a.m. on 29 October, two Moscow district football fans were removed from the passenger train by transport police at the Grazi-Vorones station.
After going to play a favorite team, the guys on the way set up a drunk debauchery on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty station of the police line at the Ghryzi station to prepare a report on the administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
Police officers filed administrative material on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for his arrival at the station station.
In the afternoon of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door in the waiting room.
A member of the transport police and security guard of RBB made calls to the broken glass.
They succeeded in arresting the perpetrator trying to escape the scene.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs staff are screened.
A criminal case is being initiated, and the senior referral to the south-east LLU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on the transport of Sergey Olkhovic has been given.
Vitaly Mutco: Waters?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, gave his opinion on the riots in the stands during the Russian Cup “Shinnik”- “Spartacus”.
I'm a supporter of sports events: clubs, leagues, Russian Federation.
But we're seeing that they're taking a bad stand.
They're waiting for someone from the side to come to order.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
We need to organize fans, we need to invite our stewards, and we don't have to do business alone.
We have now drawn up a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this issue in a close manner.
But I'm sure I'll invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedan's interview.
State, please, give me the law quickly.
It feels like these Bavaria fans came to Jaroslavl and made it all.
And we're external observers.
In fact, it's horrible to see a rostrum being hunted from a brand drive.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the World Championship.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snouden may be questioned in Russia
The American intelligence officer Edward Snowden is likely not to go beyond Russia to testify in German wiretaps by Angela Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions posed by representatives of the German Attorney-General's Office in writing or on a case-by-case basis in Russia.
Edward Snowden's exit outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In that case, he will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by U.S. Allied countries," said an agency interlocutor.
“In principle, the FWG's Gender Prosecutor's Office could send representatives to the FIU or refer written questions to Snowden”, added the source, adding that this issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Earlier, a German Bundestag member, Hans-Cristian Strebele, had reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify on the case of the German Chancellor's wiretap.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in German territory.
The CIA ex-worker made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although U.S. NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
But to do so, you have to define clearly all the conditions of his arrival," reported Strebel to Euronews.
The lawyer, Snouden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the source's statement, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
A U.S. citizen named Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he reported on U.S. secret surveillance operations.
Snowden flew through Moscow through transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities who had in absentia brought serious charges against him and remained in the transit zone of Sheremevievo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a temporary asylum document in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremevievo on the same day.
An American lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, said yesterday that his client had been employed by a "large Russian company."
The NSA surveillance of Angel Merkel last week was reported to the German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor's telephone calls began to be heard by Americans back in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of these reports, stated that surveillance of Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Poznarov left "Just Russia"
The State Duma member of the Just Russia Party, a member of its Branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he applied to the party ' s New Siberian regional office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of “survivors”.
We're sitting there drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Ilya Ponomarev puts on the table a partite," but there's nothing so orthodox," commented the deputy.
Ponomavev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional eserers office.
However, there is no intention of abandoning the mandate of Deputy State Secretary Ilya Ponomarev.
He explained that despite his withdrawal, he remained a member of the faction and was not legally able to leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomareva's intention to leave the “Just Russia” party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Gudkov and Valery Zubov would join him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDA Fumio Kisida met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“Wishers would exchange frank views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, said at the meeting of Kisid.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after the Prime Minister of Japan had visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and had become bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan in dealing with complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding that the land lost after the Second World War be restored to the country.
There are cars in the Japanese capital from which the loudspeaker says, "Come back to the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protestors, they make sure they don't exceed noise levels.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New York
We can boldly say that New York is the birthplace of the Cup Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, a concert artist named Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre in Broadway, started talking directly to the public in conversational manner.
Fey's innovation was eventually captured by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hersh, the founder of the Caroline Club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these kinds of hedliners started at Carolines and then achieved greater success, reaching a level when they are already too famous to perform in a club," Hersh said.
We created this festival as a way to keep working with them.
This year's event includes the presentations by Vanda Sykes, Cathy Griffine and Bill Mara, as well as the "Standap for Heroes", an annual music and music charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the comedy’s world.
Several comics participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example, through small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in a comedy show on a low-known cable television channel (for short-scrolling "Liga" on FXX on "Fenteze Football"), and now runs his own skate show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleit became an actor on both Subb Saturday night and “Parca and Recreation Zones”, although she is best known for a series of “Marsel Cancer in Bottles”.
Both Kroll and Slat, like other young comedians with a unique style (surrealisticist Anthony Jesellenik, evil, racially focused Kamao Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a comedian, but then he became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal storyteller of a comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Company with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly central to the work of Larry,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he would sometimes walk some street between the two houses and think, "If I'm left completely without money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistan authorities have started negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy in Great Britain, where Pakistan ' s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-President Nick Kleg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun” in a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue should work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," added diplomats.
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Techrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but they operate independently in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistan ' s Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to enter into negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would only go to negotiations if the authorities sent troops to permanent locations located in Taliban-based areas and released arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the Afghan peace process.
The oil went down to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns over large stocks were overshadowed by a report indicating that China ' s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The U.S. reference oil in December was cheap for 14 cents, at a price of $96.24 per barrel later in the morning after European time in electronic bidding on the New York commodity exchange.
On Thursday, the contract cost 39 cents, a 5.8 per cent drop in October price.
Rich oil supplies have had an impact on its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
During five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery could continue to take effect after the third quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The Brent oil, a reference class of international oil, also used by U.S. refineries, cost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Patrick Rua, chief coach of Colorado, explained his decision to release the needleman Simeon Warlam from the first minutes of a Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that his Russian confidence was not shaken by the recent night behind bars, passing from Dallas the cover of "SE" Natalie Schmelev.
And what do we have to wait for,' said Rua after the morning roll of "Lavin."
Of course, what has happened concerns us all, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be beneficial for him to get out on ice today.
We want him to go to the ice and show him his usual level.
So you're pretty sure the situation didn't affect the altar's air conditioning?
I'll see you tonight.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him to guard the gate, as was the case in previous games of this season.
The main thing is, no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until this situation is handled by the court.
There's no need to be vegan in Siberia: the thermal tomato won't replace the soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent RIA Novosity explained.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they cannot survive the winter without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, considering New Siberians and doctors interviewed on the evesday.
Drink oil per litre
Strict vegetarianism, when it is rejected not only by meat and fish but also by milk, honey, and eggs, becomes fashionable.
However, diethologists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia it is not healthy at least.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
The animals contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with vegetation.
You have to put at least milk or eggs in your diet," sure nutritionist Marina Godi.
It gives an example of fish containing the irreplaceable fatty acid of the Omega-3.
Their richest vegetable oil is linen.
"To eat it for a human being, you have to drink it for a litre!" says a nutritionist.
The medical community is confident that Siberians should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the face of our realities, there are high demands for food.
To avoid freezing, you need more caloricity.
"If a person limits himself by his animal products, he misses this calorie, respectively," says the specialist.
This is agreed by Olga Poznyak, a doctor in the field.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way out.
It is better for man to eat mainly products grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, people don't want to have a pickle, but a hot soup or something else," the doctor explains his position.
She said that from what the vegans can eat, various grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries were truly useful.
But that is certainly not enough for a full diet.
According to Gilead doctor Claudia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in the organisms is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May snow is not appropriate.
The body for life needs energy, and that's fat, above all," states the doctor.
Doctors point out that venerealism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up and need building material, including amino acids.
And by being vegetarian, we give them incomplete.
Those pregnant also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"The giants miss them," I'm sure of God.
Arifulina says that an adult has the power to choose anything, "to play the toys he wants."
He's already got a body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet children must be fully fed.
If the parents deprive him of any microitems or amino acids, choosing what he will eat for him, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"A lack of certain substances for brain development, eye, bone tomorrow will not be restored," she says.
All medical experts interviewed agree on the low quality of winter grown in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients we need than it does in the open ground.
"The quality of the food is wrong," God says.
Arifulin also notes that imported and thermal vegetables and fruits are far from perfect standards.
At times, the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples are not brown on the cut, the cucumbers are quick to yellow and fertilize, the tomatoes are tasteless and nearomatic," and give examples of the medical profession, adding that they are most likely drunk with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cages.
This is not agreed by Vera Petruk ' s Physic and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, a candidate for agriculture in science.
She said that, if all rules and requirements in greenhouses were properly followed, it was possible to produce whole vegetables.
If you try to get more out of a square metre, of course, you'll get more water and then you're going to re-fertilize the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes are rapidly growing, they are large but waterproof and sparse," she explains, adding that the issue of quality depends primarily on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The Court suspended implementation of the “stop-and-search” decision in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the “stop-and-search” programme of the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Shendlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city appealed against its decision and remedial orders, including the order to appoint a supervisor to help the police station change its practice and its associated training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on an application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it had violated the U.S. judiciary ' s code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid a show of bias, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustly addressing blacks and Latin Americans under the “stop-and-search” programme.
It appointed an external supervisor to oversee major changes, which included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most of the detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to put an end to the practice of retaining names and addresses of people whose cases had been terminated after a police check.
The debate on the city ' s appeal is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactics were criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
The “Stack-search” has been in some form for decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the independent mayor of Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latino.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective action with the Court.
Supporters of changes in the “stop-and-search” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement these practices.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the military spirit of the police rather than the crime rate, result in unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of complex police conditions by reducing the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she was not abandoning the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but was changing the way in which the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Third Gallery
Moscow has a new pedestrian zone.
It is located in the area of the Third Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novookunsk metro station to the Boloty Square.
All over, street torchers, flowering plants, benches, urns and toilets have been set up, and there have been empty fences and illegal advertising.
In addition to Clement’s and Lavrushinski alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed for vehicles: Ordin’s impasse, the Great and Small Tolmachev alley, the Kadashev Coastal and Boloty Square.
Traffic across the streets of Marosake and Petrovka is not restricted.
At the section of the Friday Street from the Novokuznski Station lobby to the Clement Passage, conditions for pedestrians were created without removal and cutting of the carriageway, passing newssmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone was the Third Gallery, the temple of the holy priest Clement of the pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments, and other attractions.
Previously, complete pedestrians were the Tver Passage, the Tablet Streets, and Kuznetsky Most Street.
The large Dimitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close the cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone break to check confidential communications
Former editor of The News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “a telephone break, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke's novel at that time as Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Andrew Edis, king's lawyer, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, News of the World received the wrong news that Clarke was meeting with her attractive special adviser, Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered a private detective named Glenn Mulkeyre to hack Polby’s voicemail and put her out of the house to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, and heard the court.
“The prosecution considers that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a person who will stand near someone’s house, hoping to be someone’s friend; he is a person who loves to offer a story to people to see what they will say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the tracking, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Clarke's novel rumours for the first time drew attention to News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voice tape received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulcaeira's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found notes on a private detective's computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as Project.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information on her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turbeck and former reporter James Weserap controlled Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're going to publish tomorrow and I'd really like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in this story was similar to that of other influential people, such as David Blancett, former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about the affair with a married woman while he himself had met with the representative of Rebecca Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiracy with other people for telephone hacking between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Moulkeyre, Turk and Weserap confessed to the breakup of the phones.
Snowden is prepared to communicate with the authorities of the FWG on the wiretap case
The CIA ex-worker, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and to meet with representatives of the FWG authorities, conveys the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the FWG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebele, through whom Snowden delivered a message to the German authorities.
Strebel the day before he met Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured by fire on Tver Street
Four passersby were injured as a result of fire at a collector in the centre of Moscow, in Tver Street.
According to Interfax, referring to the source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby who were at the time of the fire in a smoked underground crossing were injured.
According to RIA News, with reference to Paul Livinsky, head of the capital fuel and energy department, the electricity supply has now been fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
A fire in a heat collector near a house 15 on Tver Street took place in the evening of 31 October.
There was heavy smoke coming from the hatches, and in the underground crossing at Armania’s store, there was smoke.
As a result, 11 houses in Tver Street were destroyed.
The fire was destroyed at 9:45 a.m. Moscow time.
The United States of America cuts the food benefit for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial security of food plates known as "Foodstemps" has been declining since the corresponding government programme has ended.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be 36 dollars a month less than previously provided by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the average benefit per person was $133 per month.
Food aid expenditures in the United States increased to $80 billion per year owing to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid, which has been provided through the “foodstamps”, which has been called since the past days, when they were in paper coupon form.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in the Congress demand further reductions in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should aim at helping those who need it more.
Food shop owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
United States parliamentarians continue to dispute how Government funding can be further reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard released his 1994 Blackhorne platform platform free of charge on PC.
That's what WoW Insider says.
According to him, the game became available in the Battle.net section of the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers point out that only those users whose accounts belong to the United States part of the service can currently download them.
The game is not yet available to Russian users.
According to media reports, the version Blizzard has now released on PC seems to be no different from the original version of the game.
The Sundaytreck to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
Blackhorne, released 19 years ago by Blizzard, originally on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
On one occasion, Dark King Sarlak decided to kill Light King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight with Sarlock's adventurers and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackhorne was the first game the studio released after its name was changed to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackhorne's publisher was Interplay.
The Moscow Metro will have new assault rifles.
But they'll sell tickets to passengers, not for money, but for sitting down.
One trip worth 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 sittings.
The number of visits will be calculated by means of modern technology, with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first equipment will be installed at Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
The president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions of Alexei Nemov ' s gymnasium and Helena ' s Jr., will host the presentation of the new tickets.
The recognition of the National Security Agency is reinforced by corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service was assigned to take a picture of the roof of the U.S. Office, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to find the antennas of the listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Klapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the United States did not use foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal foreign commercial secrets for the benefit of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual employee who has become an veer, began publishing his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer convinced whether they can believe the director’s word for it.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was following the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the company paranoia caused by State surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was announced that Angela Merkel's chancellor's phone had been auditioned for perhaps ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made evident intensive cooperation between United States intelligence services and companies.
I think it's very likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up, ” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMi Association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now presents almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
All documents revealed by Mr. Snowden nevertheless did not yet show that the United States had communicated commercial secrets to foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain capabilities in information technology and the Internet and felt that it should attempt to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option”, says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have allowed it to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
And yet, the coverage and technical development of United States spying agencies, known as Snowden's revelations, have been a shock for some companies that used to think that China is the greatest threat of surveillance.
There has been a major shift in cloud technologies, where European company managers have become more aware that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by Claude Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use a U.S. cloud provider after unveiling an American programme for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneib, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically within this jurisdiction”.
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely evidence of what they already know: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore must be protected at all costs.
What is happening in economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
“It has been a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed much in the current debate”, says Kurt Bock, chief executive director of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because it is part of our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the response they have taken, as it can give advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long learned that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unsupervised in the hotel room is at least careless.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Motor Vehicle Company, says that for many years it has been a standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niches.
“Low and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The United States is warning its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France together with Russia and Israel in a second series of hacking violators after China claims The Washington Post.
A board member of a prestigious German company confirmed that “Frenchs are worse than everyone” when it comes to economic spying.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “It is well known that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a youth from Georgia who died in an "unintelligible accident" believe that their son was killed
The parents of a youth from Georgia whose body was found inside a closed sports mat at his secondary school gymnasium believe that their son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mat lying behind the stands at his secondary school gymnasium.
Investigators at Lawnez County Sheriff have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old contests this.
“They are absolutely sure their son was killed”, said Fox News.com, Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and reason,” said Kramp.
They think it's a cover for protecting the human being or the people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the opening revealed that Johnson had died as a result of a “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct him.
The Sheriff ' s Representative of Lawnez District was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
The South Georgia Judge ordered the authorities to publish on Wednesday all video recordings of the surveillance cameras that the investigators had seen.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video records contained the key to the interpretation of how he died.
Spartacus: For information on the persons who put the fascist symbols

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies for children
On Wednesday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy increases.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has food allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The Guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness of children ' s food allergy among teachers and service personnel and how to help in the event of an allergy reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — most commonly used for injections — EpiPen’s automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphilus.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergy reactions.
Children may say: “The feeling is like something in my tongue”, “the sense that I have hair in my tongue” or “the tongue of the pinches”.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “undetermined sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate-type external sex organs.
Newborns will no longer be required to attribute male or female genders.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to identify the gender as “undetermined” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the granting of sex to newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
One intersex person, according to BBC, said many years later, “I'm not a man or a woman”.
I'm going to be the doctor's smooth article with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the 2,000 children born every year is neither boy nor girl.
They have intersexuality, one of the approximately 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sexual abuse” — a collective term for people with typical chromosomes, Gonads or semantics or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intern.
Gender identity has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the gender cannot be defined, it is better to take advantage of all available information than to wait for and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if any.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dreser, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that a new German law would “sound as a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not have them”, he said.
You can assign a floor without surgery and then see how the person develops.
The science of how a child has a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as different from transsexual or trans-gender persons, since their status is not related to the gender but to their biological structure, which is neither male nor female, but typically to both sexes.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast and body fat; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and trans-genders in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender bias now have a camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to place male, female or third sex in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Walby, became the world's first person to be recognized as “free”, upholding in court the right to remain “undetermined” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release in France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, saying that “in a situation where the world is being drawn into a new state where the sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we turn the two other pillars of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the website of Baby Zone that she would prefer to have children set up gender at birth.
“The child’s well-being is difficult enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the child’s sex”, she said to a website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were referred to as hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god who had both genders.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived the gender as a piece of paper on which to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many argue the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make wrong choices without knowing how a child will perceive the sex entrusted to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an "immediate psychiatric case," said Dreser.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hawkins University, who believed that the gender was easily altered.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents raise a child — interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person would consider himself male or female.
But in one case in 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a careless circumcision, to cast a child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not,” said Dreser.
When he was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations claimed to be “unsatisfied”.
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but with intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s body and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABC News.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was appointed a vassal.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.
Once he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone shots and removing his chest.
The operation made him unfruitful.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people into line with their perception of intersexuality.
But Ann Teter-Metti, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed House, is concerned that German law “motivates labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child ‘undetermined sex’,” she said.
We're afraid he's going to facilitate intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will show itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Theor Mettis said that her organization supported Australian law, since “it allows adults to make choices in favour of the third sex”.
“Among adults must be able to make their own decisions about formal gender”, she said.
German law implied her appropriation at birth.
It is a battle that young children should not join at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a tentgenologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with sexual abuse and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development violation called “a complete insensitivity syndrome for Androgens”.
Since her horny receptors are not working properly, Cathy has developed women’s signs.
She's got a vulture, but she doesn't have a uterine or ovaries.
Now, at 29 years of age, Cathy is married and is studying child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or hesitating surrogate motherhood.
“ The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own, ” said Baratz.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female".
In such a case, you are doing well — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you experience joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminate the anxiety that parents may cause because they do not feel that they are doing what is right,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which floor he or she is more comfortable with — and this is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Nicholas Habibulin's brother Chicago stressed that he knew he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian worker, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two Jabs, Habibulin first missed six tampa Bay and then four from Ottava, and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth missing jack.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't do it," brings the words of KSNChicago to Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think I should approach them as games, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You need to study your past games and work on the shortcomings you have.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel good at training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowcomb.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
The gatekeepers -- I don't think I'm that alone -- always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
It doesn't matter what's happening in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss that much.
It's great that my clubmates are supportive, but in principle it's easy: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
The flight bus turned around at Altae.
A PAZ flight bus crossed the Rubtsov region of the Altay province.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reported to have been injured and reported to the Regional Office of the Ministry of Health.

According to the department, the accident took place about nine o’clock in the morning on the New York City Road, Vishnevka, about a mile [1 km] from Novikolavka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus following Rubtsksk to Wisnevk, all of them sustained injuries of various degrees of gravity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsowski, two of whom were hospitalized at the Rubtska CB.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that, once the markets of Latin America and Asia have been established, the Superjet 100 aircraft will also be shipped to Europe.
"We expect that in general we will receive such arrangements by more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," says Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Airo.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be available to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll ever be in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 - An aircraft built by the civil aircraft of Sugo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The linker is based on modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment at 100 passenger seats.
Dnipropetrius energy has started a unique rescue program... an aristine nest
In an old age, a villager on a high pole had a wheel set off from the TV, and a heavy nest was well held.
Such special pillars have long been abandoned, so the Aist has loved the poles of the electric transmission lines, and the intertwined branches are based on wires, which make the Aist House sound secure.
Anna’s grandmother, who has been living with an Aristocratic family for 20 years in the village of Ivanovka, noticed the nest settling despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds are putting new branches above them, and the bottom layer is already in between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of Asians who nested every year at a court of lords, pulled out and punished for the summer of three or four birds, but they don't want to be alone.
As soon as the birds left for the warm regions, Anna’s grandmother called the King’s Environment, which belongs to her support.
I didn't even expect that there would be such a quick response.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanowka, they were surprised to find that the nest was still there, and told the technical director of DTEC, Sergei Berezowski, of the DT “Dneprobleblenergo”.
The conductor’s wires, which are essentially inside the nest, weigh between 150 and 200 kilograms [150 and 200 kg], have begun to become corrosive.
At any point, the birds could have been killed by an electric discharge.
The locals also risked being left out of the light because of damage to the wires.
This is why the line interiors have begun an operation to save the nest, not for the first time in our practice.
And research and research scientists at Dniepropetrov National University have been able to help with the development of a system for the transport of nests.
They did practice for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well-known Dynopropetro ornithologist, advised the energy managers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nest.
For starters, it was estimated that more than 50 Aist “headquarters” were in emergency condition.
Special metal platforms that resemble funnels have been quarrelled for their reconstruction.
The base was wrapped in Hebrew branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to the researchers, it is sufficient to lay old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the A'ists will build their own houses.
A month ago, the first nest was renovated in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskov district.
A new track of iron was placed next to the electric drive and placed on it a platform with an old, already used nest.
The whole operation cost 9,000 dollars.
And the day before, the same village was held in the village of Ivanovka of Petrikov, in the suburb of Anna’s grandmother.
Here the platform was placed in its original place, only to be placed above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartments have been severely repaired.
By the end of the year, four more nests are expected in the area of the Dniepropetrets.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others callously kill them.
The day before, the whole area was covered by the sad news, in the village of Ust-Camenka of the Apostolic Region, on the day the pheasant was opened, poachers shot a swan family on a local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people; the natives fed them and did not harm them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and the four larynx were already lying on the water dead.
The Apostolic Police Department now finds out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
Russian March is getting more popular
On the Day of People's Unity on November 4, Moscow will be hosted by a “Russk March” mayor.
According to a survey by Levada Center, support for the Russian marches is increasing - 40 per cent of citizens are already in different degrees of endorsement.
According to Leada Center, 40 per cent of citizens have various approvals for the Russian March: of these, 11 per cent are definitely positive, and 29 per cent are “fastly positive”.
The popularity of the “Rus March” was gradually increasing - in 2006 only 14 per cent of Russians were welcomed, and in December 2010 more than twice as many citizens (28 per cent).
“Determinately negative” is 7 per cent of Russians, 19 per cent of Russians are “at an early date”.
A further 35 per cent were unable to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, the Moscow mayor agreed to hold a “Rus March” of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, as reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action takes place every year on People ' s Unity Day since 2005.
In response to a question from sociologists, “Did you hear that on 4 November the Russian Marches were being held in Russia under the slogans for the protection of Russian rights?” Three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens replied negatively.
Currently, only 1 in 5 Russians (20 per cent) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, nearly one third of citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the Russian Marchs.
Remember, three years ago, on 11 December, a natural meeting of nationalists was held in Manez Square that turned into riots.
Leada Center also asked the Russian about the holiday held on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of the citizens gather for this celebration.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the October 7th Day of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62 per cent) do not intend to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow's mayor agreed on the Russian March in Ljublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the march of Dmitri Demuškin.
In addition to Lublino's march, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the “Klovrat” group, also agreed with the authorities.
Like "The Russian March 2012"
On People ' s Unity Day in 2012, Nationalists passed the march from the Yakiyan Coastal to the Central Artist ' s House, where the gathering took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants of 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the number of 6,000 participants.
Communication: Obama ' s electoral headquarters considered Baiden ' s exception in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's immediate advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Bayden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
It's an discovery -- the brightest sensation of all the expected books of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign "Staves Double: The Game Has Changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the book to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the incoming presidential assistants had conducted “scale-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exception of Bayden could help raise hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to political examiner The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials of the pre-election headquarters and the White House, namely Bill Daily, former head of the White House Administration, to assess the effect of appointing former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago Pre-election Staff and the Oval Office.
Only six closest presidential advisers — including Daley, the former head of the electoral staff of Obama Jim Messin, and former senior advisers of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The Stavats doubled their claim that Daily was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their “near personal relations”, but eventually refused to do so when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list would not “improv significantly improve Obama's chances”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, the Administration actually considered the possibility of replacing Bayden Clinton.
“I was actively in favour of a lot of things, and that was one of them, ” said Daley to the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at that time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
Although Daley described the study as “necessary verification,” Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had made enough contribution to examine whether that step would bring dividends to the vote.
“The pre-election headquarters will not spend such amounts of money on interviews and focus groups if they do not take something seriously”, said Martin in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had been studying the possibility of replacing it.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss then knew about a possible diversion.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President had been “acquainted” with a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama knew.
Martin added that the “Staves are doubled” does not provide a clear answer to the question as to whether the results of political sensing have been reached at Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Baiden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
Would you like a light in the dark of ice?
A British businessman created the world's first light-bright ice cream with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the florescent properties of the marine animal to develop a brilliant food.
He came to this idea, read the scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to re-establish the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the eater, raising the pH level in the protein and making it shine.
Chris says that since ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of its mouth, that means that the more you lie, the more bright it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of Ice Me, I'm Taste, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning of production, so you'll get about 2 g of substance for ?200."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it's going to raise the pH level and the ice cream starts to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to present it in Halloween because it creates such a wonderful shining effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because it's four times as expensive as gold.
So every balloon costs me about ?140.
But it's pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and solid gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's not possible by definition because of the fracture caused by ice crystals, which consist of ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, which are synthesised by Chinese scientists
Avangarda coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about preparing his team for the regular CWC championship game against Salawat, noted that Ochichi had conducted a thorough study of the damage from the Metallurga magnetic.
The specialist stressed that Avangarda should pay increased attention to the defense game.
We've been watching a video game against the Metallurga magnetogram, and we're using the official "Avangard" site of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of jaybs, not a very nice moment.
We missed because of our mistakes, because we didn't do a game job.
We knew the rival had the performers.
Statistics showed that they had five attacks on the road -- three jacks were shot down.
Very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
My guys and I are very careful at each game, talking after the game, getting ready for a new rival.
The main thing is to make the installation work.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against the Metallurg.
The game was done and the score was 2:0.
They missed the naked goal, and in the third period, they started to make mistakes.
Given the difficulty of the game, there was no point in the involvement of defenders.
You have to fight the entire team.
Now Avangard's got a long home series, a match coming in a day, and the team's tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to carry out your moments and play.
Huckey is an emotional game, if you do the installation, it doesn't work out so hard.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of Fur have been waiting on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, child laborers promised to provide drinking water and biotoilets to drivers
At the border crossings, hundreds of Furs were buried when they entered Russia.
This situation was created by a change in the customs rules for the handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the turn is to create a Russian side that has not warned of innovations in advance.
Since 28 October, Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee delivery of goods, reports Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs.
A new model document is applied in countries which have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Pass points operate in reinforced mode.
A “FACTOV” correspondent visited the border and spoke to the hostages who had been held hostage.
Prices at the Newazosk road store are rising every day, as is the case with the Fur.
The trucks stand in several rows, about two kilometres long.
The Novoavsk - Weselo-Vozenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
The goods are then shipped to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, the rules were still in use, followed by the introduction of the rules, and Alexei Golovaneev (a photo) was complained by a distance fighter who was carrying goods from Turkey through Russia to Kazakhstan and had been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance at which they are carried.
Minimum insurance - 45,000 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 roubles).
Those who travel near Georgia, Armenia, with a cargo of up to $50,000, pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 roubles) and pass.
The others are stuck because no one has that much money with them!
Imagine if a driver is carrying a load of only $4,000, but as long as he goes to Moscow, he needs roubles 90,000 (almost 23,000 rouves) to pay for transit!
No condition for survival on the border, nor is it, nor is it possible for a man to eat near his own car.
At border stores and cafes is always expensive, but prices like here, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers focused and quickly accused them of having a baton, a seven - cup of coffee, and a 25 - graft plate of soup.
There's one.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the stairs, we're going to the restroom.
Don't wash or shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife made it all up.
It's a week longer, and it's been a comfort to another Víctor Scootarenko.
Will my car be on the line in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water?
There's 11 and 15 bucks.
What, a bottle of crystal or water standing on silver?
We have a coffee shop, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, steaming the seller.
The plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region after the situation began to be highlighted in the media.
The leadership of the Amvosiv and Novosov Paradise Administrations was instructed to provide for all those who line up at the Ukrainian-Russian border with potable water, as the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk District Administration, Sergey Dergunov.
The ambulances are now on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotoilets will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the problem of queues would be resolved in the coming days.
As at 31 October, as at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were being used by the Donetsk press service.
“FACT” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking persons of Lithuania and countries of the Eastern Partnership, such as a statement by BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic (DGB).
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
In particular, it is reported that Moscow intends to “speak” President Dal Gribawskite of Lithuania and to publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosaghirve relating to the facts of the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence services, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department of Analysis of the Public Administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Eugeni Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania on several occasions and has participated in the assembly of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A member of the operation is also alleged to be a member of Department V. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under cover of scientific work, visited Lithuania regularly before the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnova is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, President Gribauskete of Lithuania stated that he was aware of the information she was preparing.
In her view, Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and “the country's desire for energy independence” were the main reasons.
The Lithuanian leader has not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus claimed that in the Kremlin it was “not sufficiently respectful”.
In addition, Gribausket accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of proposing “one or only claim” to Lithuania.
Remember, in September, Roswannadzor suspended the import of the Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products did not conform to sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare a petition to WTO.
In the United States, the school principal shot down teenagers.
The headmaster of an American secondary school literally brought despair.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies threw a man's house with toilet paper.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on young people, resulting in several injuries in the leg and a 15-year-old boy's hand.
Since the hooligans were not on the Director ' s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
Notice, shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible rule.
Just before the man opened the shooting in the middle of Ridgecrest in California, U.S.A., straight across the street.
Then the criminal took two casual passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to escape.
Previously, shooting had been opened at a primary school in Newton, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked in school, she was a teacher.
Shooting in American school: a 14-year-old girl injured
A further shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, to stay up late, and to set up a masquerade for our area.
I'm more like a violin now.
I haven't been invited to distribute candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I'm probably not going to be here this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow in the case of Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Trade Federation predicts that the costumes will take $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion, sexless objects.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Hot Dead, and I'm sure that the astronauts in the Daft Punk style will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most common costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny dog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't have to talk.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, glaciers, Wilk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, these are excellent news for 41 million eligible children who have prepared to conquer our areas.
What's more, we're going to buy and we're not going to fool ourselves, we're going to eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn beans; yet, according to the National Association of Conderators, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing is more than Halloween's house with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as "The Horror behind the Wall" (which, by the way, is in this prison), "The War and Cry" and "The House of Shock".
Moreover, according to the American Humans community, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in America that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those shocking photographs where you almost described what your friend put on Facebook, and you can't take away, and then the guy you like sees this photograph and leaves a comment like "class expression."
And we'll end up talking about the titanium.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tikwa when we were children, and the cutting out of Jack's lamp is like the ornament of a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were children.
Fortunately for us, the child-to-child fashion started only last year with the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying up on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew to £542 million this year.
If you want to do more, visit Tim and Susan Matsidon in Napa State of California and try cutting anything out of their pumpkin at £2032.
The site of the Ministry of Defence in Estonia was restored after the Ukrainian hackers attacked
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was re-established after morning cyberattacks, reporting to the agency's press service.
According to Vice-Centre Minobora on Information and Administration, Taymar Peterscope, this was a primitive attack, and the site was just overloaded with requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, and to date, the site has been re-established.
"The damage done to the Ministry is minimal," said Petero of Postimes.
According to Peterscope, it is too early to tell who organized the attack.
“We will necessarily analyse the causes of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents”, he admitted.
On 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted a message confirming the hacker attack on the site of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia and opposing the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave.
We're in favour of independent Ukraine.
"Get away from Ukraine," says Anonymous statement.
Previously, the Ministry of Defence reported that the Company of the Marines of the Feodosian Independent Battalion of the Ukrainian Marines would participate in NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command and post training exercises.
I had to close several schools and hospitals because of the impurity of the force.
Four schools in Zimbabwe Province of Southern Matabeleland had to be closed down because of the attack... of Goblins.
As the local elder explained, the children were panicked, and it was impossible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's own story for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for closing school.
Adults too fear unclean power.
In summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because of the attack on medical personnel by Goblins.
Land Rover Race series announced
Inside are race seats and six-point safety-belts, as well as an internal communications system.
You can also obtain modernized brakes, a service package that provides access to BowlerWorks mechanics, logistical support and storage of the car between activities.
Drew Bowler, the manager of Bowler Motorport, said: “Parts turning to Bowler have changed”.
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people who are looking for trouble, adventure and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to suggest this in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try various disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally Race.
We were very happy to develop a Defender Challenge car — a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as for the opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Nothing is known to the Russian militia about the group “Bratsky Circle” - New News
This is reported by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After news of the release of Leaps by the U.S. Department of Finance to the control lists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate "Bratsky Circle", we looked at all the databases, but we did not find such a group," said the agency’s interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of this information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As previously written by NI, yesterday the U.S. Department of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Bratsk Circle”.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's on the list as Grisha, on the eve of the day.
The figures of the popular Russian performer are identical.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevreidze, creatively pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five others were mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli national, a Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR whose nationality is not specified.
In the United States, I'm sure that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, transported money to bandits at their request.
A photograph of the singer is attached to this communication and all its data are relevant.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house on Phuket.
The agency noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of the U.S. Minfin leads to the freezing of assets in the United States and the ban on business dealings with persons residing in the United States.
Leaps Maily Serikov's assistant stated that there was no notice to the singer, "It's hard to answer the question whether it's Gregory, the one that's being talked about in connection with a U.S. scandal."
All Leaps knows is media information.
There were no official notifications to him, although I do not know if they exist in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all funny on the one hand, and strange on the other, and unexpected," she said to RIA News.
She said that Gregory Leps did not live on Phukete, but according to Minfin of the United States, he did have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leaps was now on a long journey to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him on his way to the city of Preacheschenk.
Running out on a field at Shinnik's match.
Some details of the identity of the fanatic who fled to the field during the match 1/16 final of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavian Shinnik and the Moscow Spartacus became known.
As the Head of the FDC, Arthur Grigorianz, said in reference to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Moscowian.
He's currently being detained.
"In addition, Grygoriantz described how a fan was able to break through into the field, "It turns out that this, called a spectator, went to ambulances accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, which was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
Then he pushed two escorts away and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South rostrum to the corner of the East and North rostrum.
He ran through the field.
Managers are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this area of operation of stewards - the police cannot intervene in what is in the field.
He ran to the rostrum, crossed through the Eastern rostrum.
And at that time, riots broke out in the East Front and on the runway," said the head of KDC.
Recall that the KDC decision of the Moscow Spartacus will hold, without audience, the upcoming 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiva and Zenita, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
The fire crews were called to rescue a lost pup who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous advance in a career.
Coker-Spaniel Ruby fled after she was in a small accident.
Three days later, when she was stuck in a career, she noticed a man walking a dog.
Firemen came down a rope on a hill to save the dog from imminent death
The pup was fortunate enough to be saved after the fire brigades were called up to pick him up and take him to a safe place, after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet on the dangerous retreat of the hanging slope.
A nine-month-old Spanishman, Ruby, fled after a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her masters, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were in the middle of a career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverously looking for their missing dog and posting messages on social networking sites after she had fled to her career after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog guide noticed Ruby, stuck 50 feet high on her advance in a career.
A technical rescue unit from the Klekheiton fire station hurried down to the scene, went down on ropes to save Ruby, and used the transport to raise her up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of the hanging slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move nor did she get muscle when she was saved; she's completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
The rescue officer, Peter Lau, said: "Rubie is very lucky she was saved."
It was likely that she might have suffered a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for inspection and it was found that she was all right, except for depletion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To observe salvation was frightening”.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she were exhausted and lost consciousness, she would probably fall.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave — what they had done.
We were so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the city of Kitty added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there”.
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she ended up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Cathy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a bak balcalist for a 2004 Jagger song, Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a webman and said, "He was playing with me when I was 18.
She added: “It was a long time ago, and it was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he had “tegorically denied that he had ever hit Cathy Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps it confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests in Rolling Stone tour this year.
Her new Prism album was debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: The gap with Europe gives Scottishs a choice.
One more day, another terrible one about independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European zone of free movement as a condition for EU membership.
There are reports of passport control in Bervik and of the border with barbed wire along Adrianov Wall.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement in the rest of Europe, although — predictablely — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did no one indicate that EU member countries spend much time turning their formal rules around in a way that was convenient for them.
As Scotland is not now part of the Shengen zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from Scottishs.
So it's not a noteworthy story.
And so old that she became a cripple: for the first time, I heard a “soul” that “independentness means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting point lost on the story of an old story.
Why should independent Scotland comply with European orders at all?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels's yoke, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, the Europa project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposing the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining force.
Even in Germany, a party of Europeans, “Alternativo for Germany”, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially evicting the Free Democratics (the “Liberal Democratics” equivalent) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The strict economy measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the fences imposed on national economies through the maintenance of a single currency have led many people to believe that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with national Governments working in excessive budget deficits — that was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members from exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — that German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a position of disadvantage in terms of productive opportunities in comparison with Germany.
The only means of rescue is to cut salaries and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
The current problems of the budget and the currency are followed by a deeper problem of Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of the “green” energy package introduced by Brussels, a cipher that represents subsidies from both French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralysing price constraint, as we've seen in Granjmute.
No global freeze on wages will stop the crushing victory of the U.S. cheap sludge gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a riot, especially in France, once the EU's most brightest supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way of controlling Germany and putting Paris at the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France ' s devastated economy in a state of distress.
The result is the right against the EU party Marin Le Pen's “National Front” just won the decisive additional elections by putting the ruling party of socialists in third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labourers that it cannot be assumed that the right-wing divisions will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his new popularity among the French white working class?
It wishes to use the elections to the EU next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the parties against the EU will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take over for the first time in the European Parliament.
This is my view: the rapidly growing moods against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are coming together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like a vague “European (Sovereign) nations”, which was well liked by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I'm assuming that Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain is likely to be neglected in the Atlantic.
In what provision does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in effect) of Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will succeed under a more free European arrangement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, as strange as it is, the most successful political movement in Europe against the harsh economy measures obtained by an impressive majority of votes in 2011 owing to objections to the cost reductions proposed (and realized) by the Labour Treasury Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of threy and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take the strict savings imposed on Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging
African and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers show studies.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
No evidence of the fault of hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms for early sexual maturity
The trend towards early puberty is not so strong among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eteridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family affairs.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop breast formations and develop frontal hairs at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — that does not usually mean full sexual maturity,” said Caplovitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, frontal hairs, and armpits and body smells, appear earlier in the case of girls.
But there was only a small displacement in menarche (first menstruation) age over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 years in 1970.
“After breast development has begun, it takes at least two or three years before Menarche,” said Caplovitz, also author of the book Early Sexual Maturity of Girls: How to Cope with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturity will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes actual sexual maturity, but is considered “premature” when breast increase is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — something the paediatrician can monitor carefully.
Faster progress can be a basis for analysis by endocrinologist in order to avoid serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slower growth and lower growth at an age.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Caplowitz is careful with the drugs, but recognizes that “scientization can alleviate behavioural problems and girls' feelings, that they are different from peers”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruation at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school, scared and frustrated because she was the first of her friends.
There are many theories on the causes of early sexual maturity.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual parcels in the media.
Boys — like girls — have earlier sexual maturity.
The capital claims that the most important prerequisite is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links body fat to puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Throughout the world, early puberty is likely to affect everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that while boys have hair on their face and on their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards full early sexual growth is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of hair hairs and frontal hairs is common even with infants and children of teenage age.
“We must be careful as to how we determine the true advance of sexual maturity, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Goribe Children’s Hospital in Morristaun, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from a paediatric on how to speak with their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected conversation, ” explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Early blooming girls need to be confirmed that even when this is done before, it is a normal part of life.
A U.S. Boeing stuck in Chitty is preparing for his flight.
Observer flights under the Open Sky Treaty over Russia and an unscheduled landing on Wednesday in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m., will leave the city ' s air fields in Moscow.
The airport authorities allowed the flight of the aircraft to take cash for fuel.
At the airport, it was reported that the plane would fly to Ulan Uda.
According to other data, it's going to go to the United States.
It has been reported that a plane flying to Ulaan Ud landed in Zabaykali province because of fog.
He was not released from Chita airport because of unpaid accounts.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reporting ITAR-TASS.
According to the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board aircraft are not entitled to go outside Chita airport, only two Russian airports - in Cubanca and Ulaan Uda - can pass border controls.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992 and involves 34 States.
Observation flights are made over Russia, Canada, the United States, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, and enhance crisis prevention and resolution capacities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much money do late celebrities earn in the U.S.
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her late Michael Jackson, whose post-death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million, had closed her.
There's a lot of behind him, but there's a lot of other people who've lost their lives, who last year's "earned" a few times less.
Elvis Presley was the second of the most famous post-year history of the world's missing celebrities, 55 million per year, and a line below was author of Peanuts Charles Schulz's comic books with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million), were included in the first five.
They also listed Maryland Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
The first roll of Igor Guliev opened in Moscow
On 23 October, Igor Guliev ' s first flagship was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igor Goläev is known to the general public for his wonderful works of lux mecha.
And now they're going to be able to appreciate even more fashion fans -- the first bout was finally opened in Moscow, where the designer and the dolce vita party were about.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I got a shop opened in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
It was with that words that Igor cut the red tape and invited all who wanted... to try the models!
Jet aircraft manufacturers are at odds with the width of the seat when large orders are made on horseback
There was a heated dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class ' s seats on long flights, setting the tone for the violent confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-distance flights to economy class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of airlines, and the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of recent aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says that this should be decided by the airline.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of the larger versions of their two-motor long-distance aircraft, while potentially record-winning orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The layout of the rear part of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people are in a row — is central to statements of the cost-effectiveness of new mini-aerobose projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people based on economic class seats of more than 17 inches in widths of 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of A350 will transport 350 people in an economy class in seats of 18 inches wide, 9 inches in a row.
Air traffic giants often exchange technical strikes by means of ads in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly to the Dubai airline, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing the financials of a slide depicting three people in a restaurant close to each other called "Would you agree?"
“Boeing offers long-range flights in seats smaller than regional turbovint aircraft”, said the sales manager of Airbus John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when a broad-sealing Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-range travel, the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average tali of those recently called “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus says that he commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing challenges the numbers of Airbus on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not intervene in decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and comforts.
According to her, research shows that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said Kent Creever’s salon specialist Boeing.
They don't want us to decide for them what will profit them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space side by side, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that can influence profits.
This dispute is followed by a flight orders race, estimated at at least $700 billion at catalysed prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
For the first time, Reuters reported in July that seat positions are just what fuels competition in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one place in their last two-motor motorway models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of the 10-local series of 777X with the original 9-local layout of the rows of constructive decision 777.
The unit cost gains are reduced when compared to the 10-day layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make his aircraft more competitive than ours,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Passengers Unit in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full-time accommodations for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seat of 18 inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is due to a threat from the 777th model,” said interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girls Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide a chair, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Travelers of jet planes around the world even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
In welcoming comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense complexion for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for further modifications of the saloons by offering wider passage points on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly” but may divert attention from the sales of the 777X model.
A new antinic vaccine can deprive you of the fun smoking process
Scientists have developed an antinicotin vaccine that could deprive the cigarette smoking process of pleasure.
One dose of vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
We need further tests before we start human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Kristall of New York Medical College said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-Nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibody tracks any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before reaching the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
In tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued to function normally.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were "done loose," and that's a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, say researchers.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Transnational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it's turning liver cells into an antitel factory.
Professor Kristall said that if a future human vaccine were fully safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed.
Olives: One third of the rural settlements of Podmoskovia
Vice-President Yuri Olinenikovya stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in Moscow are fully supplementary.
A total of 187 settlements out of the 288 settlements receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent grants.
The budget is about 25 billion roubles from the regional budget,” said Olenik.
Also, the Governor Vice-President noted that only three urban settlements, Mitishin, Onesotzo and Puscino, had incomes of more than 1 billion roubles for 2013.
Rural income in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, “it's not enough at all”.
The cost of maintaining the local administration in the 88 settlements of Podmoskovia is over 70 per cent, “with a decline in the quality of services”, noted Olenik.
He had previously instructed the heads of municipalities of Podmoskovia until the end of November to consider which settlements needed to be populated, merged into urban districts or changed administrative administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of Moscow stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Podmoskovie, it was planned to reduce the number of additional rural settlements.
Also in the Cani, Kashir, Solnekorsk, Columinsky, Lubertsa and Cotts, there is a request for municipal consolidation.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
President Modelduma Igor Brinzalov also stated that the entire area of the forthcoming admreform was planning about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmoskovia.
This is because of the fact that less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Podmoskovia have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenin celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenin does not hide her great pleasure in raising her children.
Although it is now that Arbenin spends a great deal of time with creativity and social activities, she still has the opportunity to fight Martha and Artem, not only spending time in their education but also fun as much as she can.
In the last week, Diane reported twice to her worshipers about her pedagogic talents.
First, she put a picture on Facebook that shows her children being taught to read.
And yesterday, I had fans, and I showed him how Artema and Martha were dressed up on Halloween.
The broom race is ready! Our first holloween" -- that's what Diane called a photograph of her children dressed in birthday costumes.
That's not wise, because they're like any other Russian boys and girls, they're related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce “undetermined sex” in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born of hermafrodites, instead of male or female, to indicate “undetermined”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave “semi” on the birth certificate incomplete.
For "F" (women's sex) or "M" (men's sex), parents may write "X" (undetermined) for the time being.
This decision is aimed at preventing parents from hastening a “specify” sex operation.
Statistics show that one of the world’s 2,000 newborns is hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being exposed to Obeyd's influence
The former New South Wales Labour Minister, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the state's anti-corruption supervisory body.
The former New South Wales Minister, Joe Tripodi, refutes changes in the lease of sea objects at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who owned shares secretly in three State land real estates.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday as to whether Mr. Obeid had been lobbying several state ministers to extend leases to Serkular Ki, where two restaurants and cafes belonged to the Obeid family, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tridodi was aware of Mr. Obeid ' s secret involvement in real estate facilities, following the testimony of Mr. Tridodi Lynn Ashpool, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that rent should be presented at an open competition.
The tenants were opposed to this and wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, the Cerquilar Ki leases, which were offered to the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without being awarded an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tridodi acknowledged, had urged changes in government rental policy.
The telephone conversations presented by ICAC were made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Daem, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question discussed during these telephone conversations about the development of commercial rental policies?” asked Mr. Tripodi, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tridodi. “
I can't remember what was under discussion, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A high-level administrative official, in an interview with Fox News, confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but said it was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the objectives were Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel launched air strikes on missile cargo inside Syria.
Foreign workers in Division 457 visas may be tested for “liquidity”
The “liability” test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it aims to expand repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria designed to prevent the use of a 457 class visa to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour Representative Maxine McCew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric of foreign workers, saying that this might offend Australia ' s neighbours.
“Foreign statements at the end of the line” and “worked Australians” are a very unpleasant departure to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market”, she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the results of this historic artifact, I would not have been surprised.
The paper presented for discussion outlined 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brandan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under consideration.
If the criteria for “liability” are accepted, the applicant may be examined for “whether the candidate is genuine in a situation where the candidate is a relative or close owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of Division 457, since previously enterprises that had intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then hired by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died allegedly from a heart attack following his arrival on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The bereaved nine - year - old son of this man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities hurriedly sent a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Simeon Warlam said that a hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockeyist Simeon Varlama Evrenia Vavrinyuk said that he was suffering from alcoholism, passed on to the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking”, said a woman in particular.
We will recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beatings on a needleman in Russia's congregated Russia, Simeon Warlam, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her hair and beat her, after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Warlam himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beatings, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete’s movement around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He also faces up to six years of imprisonment for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 2026.
The Minister of Transport of Baroness Kramer noted that the project would “unify Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was “in awe” from the prospect of working on a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Mydlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will be drawn to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and northern England from $32.7 billion to $42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has mandated HS2 Ltd to consider further improving railway capacity and reducing travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include a way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our HS2 goal is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We develop HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about urban transport; 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better reported by HS2 throughout the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “The current announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called upon Mr. Carmayk to support, in a clear manner, the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for high-speed railways across Great Britain”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, providing benefits for all and continuing the Glasgo railway line, Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is planning to continue.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and to a joint decision on the following steps.
Thorium is the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large areas for generation.
The atomic energy costs nothing but leaves behind a mass of expensive waste disposal.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeliev system.
It is found all over the world, and experts claim that its dispersal does not leave waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite U.S. mitigation measures for these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the Air Force.
Passengers are already able to do so during the main part of the flight, but many resent the fact that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required United States airlines to undertake a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
In the Civil Aviation Safety Office, also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight were still in effect in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, it stated.
The issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to ensure safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety regulations reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, had not objected to the change in its use on board its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, but had stated that it would follow the regulator's instructions.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of permitting the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it is available on our planes (bulletless entertainment system),” said the Spokesperson.
Quantas stated that he would comply with the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon,” she said.
The FAH Regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be careful to examine the decision of the FAH and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the influence of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airline fleet.
The transporters will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to the radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, manual transportation standards and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude,” said FAH.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn their devices off during landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head is heard in Cuba's feud of extremism
The Football match between Angie and Cuba has resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Dagestana after the fans burned down the Dagestan flag, and Cuba's giant has sounded differently.
The head of Dagestana Ramasan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited the Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the gymnodar province allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, inter alia, to war with the bassuranas.
Take the giant Krasnodar Krasnodar province, and this was approved by our time in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
“We are going to death on your mother's side of the enemy and on the bassurman's side.” “Why should we write such words in a gymna, to harm some believers against other believers,” expressed solidarity with the President of Parliament of Hizri Shihsaid.
Putin achieved impunity for her friend Assad
And now the news is from the ocean, namely, Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck Russian-produced missiles, which were reportedly destined for Hizbollah.
Syria has now fulfilled the important requirement of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russian mediation that prevented the United States from carrying out the military operation they had entered into this summer.
More details about the weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will tell our main international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poisoning gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal by a friend of Asada, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had failed the declared chemical manufacturing factories.
The longer-term and heavy task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington, D.C., used to say Asad's days are deemed to be.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is, not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to leave.
But Asad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are separated and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and baskets.
Many believe Bashar Asad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Asad himself has given the impression of a person willing to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, D.C., the United States Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is hardly any easier off than being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding up.
And it changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and LCC
President Vladimir Putin of Russia has established a new Ministry responsible for construction and JCK and has proposed to lead his ex-governor of the Ivanov region of Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menem at the residence in Novo Ogarjevo, and Myanmar did not refuse to head a new agency.
The Spokesperson of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all the construction and LUC functions were being transferred to the new Ministry from the Minsk region.
Mikhail Men - son of the famous Orthodox priest Protoir Alexander Me, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career had begun, and he had been elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo Posada district, as deputy of the State Duma, as First Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow, as Vice-President of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was governor of Ivanov province.
The owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
At the Bendemir Trade Center in Singapore, Janani Amirhalinga is laying a gold bracelet, a ring and a silver ring to pay for her daughter's schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested in it,” says Ms. Amirthhalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt increases — is such that the ValueMax, where it makes a deal, this week became the third lolobard registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Loan on jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as poor bank loans.
Singapore usually has an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, slightly above 15.4%, offered by the United Ostetas Bank office, a local creditor with a subsidiary at the same trading center.
However, loggers have the advantage of not requiring a check of creditworthiness or proof of salary and may issue loans faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are turning to the leopards because families feel pressure because of the increased cost of living and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans fueled by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families turn to the leopards to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to an increase in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80 per cent of GDP, as compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week was barely out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued declines in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The point is that with prices rising, people in the middle and lower [income] scales will look for ways to increase their incomes wherever they can, ” says Song Sung Wun, economist at CIB, Malaysian bank.
Recordedly high gold prices over the last two years have increased the pace with which people put their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the things stored in 200 Lombards of the city-state are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put in the gold chain of grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest lolobard operator, EasyMoney, observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in Lombard business is such that the ValueMax, an operator of the Bendemir office and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Jing, executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an expansion of 60 per cent of S$66 million this week from the stock exchange of Singapore.
While some creditors had been criticized because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the Lombard did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
“clients are laying objects that they already own, and the monetaryization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she said.
It is gaining greater public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
At the same time, Lombards are not limited to those in difficult financial circumstances.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices by laying gold pellets or Rolex clocks, which can provide up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to borrow money for short periods of time for commercial projects or investments or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important for the population not to have the number and status of health facilities available, but to have the quality of health care provided.
The implementation of the “Tulk Health Modernization 2011-2013” programme, the reorganization of health facilities in our city, will provide an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and mothers.
For example, since the association with the Gorbora, there has been an even greater opportunity to involve narrow specialists from the GPG “NKB” to consult pregnant people with various pathology, and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
During the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the maternity home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards has emerged.
Over the years, approximately 8 million roubles were allocated for major maintenance, and 112 items worth 42 million roubles were purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive newborn post.
The Cesarean section uses the Sell-Severe apparatus to collect blood from the operating wound and return it to her baby after special treatment, avoiding foreign blood transfusions.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory unit.
The Women ' s Consultation has an electronic register, and e-cards and patient history are planned for the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasus.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes at one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and looted them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old man who had been convicted of Chechnya.
David Alabama's Bavaria Protector became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he preceded winter sports, which are traditionally best in the country.
The second place was that of Marcel Herscher, and the third was a skier from Gregor Schlerenzauer's trailer.
Last season, 21-year-old Austrians of Philippine-Nigerian origin helped their team win the WEFA League championships, championships and German Cup.
Archavin's ex-wife is resting with Acter Andrey Chadova
The former civilian wife of a pilot football player named Zenita, Andrei Arshavin Yuli Baranovsky, is on leave with actor Andrei Chad.
Julia spends her time in Italy with the actress Anastasia Zadroja, her fiancée is a figure of Sergei Slavov, and actor Andreya Chadova.
The photos of the couple's joint walks were published at Instagram Anastasia Zazdaya.
This is not the first joint picture of Andre and Julia.
On October 5th, the West Bank released a picture of a couple standing on the shores of the Gulf of Finland in Comarovo.
In mid-October, Andrew Arshavin admitted to living apart from his civil wife, Julia.
Recall that Julia Baranowski and Andrey Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is meeting with the ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Archavin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the weakened Tasmanian health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state Government will not waste its resources.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “immediate measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island State, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
A four-year funding decision was taken following consultations between the Government and the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state”, said Ms. Plybersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the planned operations team.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract disposal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money for clinics that receive unrecorded patients in Hobart and Loneston to improve post-patient care, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal e-health cards in local hospitals.
“This investment will go to the ideas put forward by the leading doctors on how best to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government should work in strict accountability and accountability.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would be out of control “unless genuine reform follows them, which will put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal package will contribute significantly to the de-health of this state of affairs,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures are largely offset by recent reductions.
But the Federal Opposition Representative for Health, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a solution similar to a leuklasterist”.
“The reason we're here is that the state Labour Government has pulled $430 million out of health care,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government takes almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, it cannot be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plebersek to guarantee that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracies.
Guillaume Nicola's ecumenization of Denis Didro's novel can boast of exceptional position and historical details, but it's also more taken than it should have been.
A film that takes place in France in the 1760s tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocratic woman sent to a monastery of her family.
When she starts to rebel, she is extremely cruel at the hands of a sadistic woman and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to speed or sensation — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative is likely to be a test of the sort of vat and of the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacture equipment, says the observation team
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, and declared an international monitoring group on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near a facility where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
Application of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons one day prior to
The deadline of 1 November, established by this Hague-based organization, for Damascus to destroy or “inoperate” all chemical weapons production tools and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the acquisition of a poisonous gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially an initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The statement was made during violent fighting on Thursday in Safira City, where experts believe that a chemical weapons facility, as well as its storage site, is located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights Protection.
A group of activists who monitored losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
The Government stated that 29,954 were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, there were 2,202 army fighters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations assessment dated 25 July, 100,000 people have died in conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
The Assad Army fought the rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of which are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the short duration of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “at present satisfied that it had verified and seen all critical means of production and mixing/fuel equipment declared by Syria destroyed”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two locations for security reasons, as stated by the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both locations had been said by Syria to have “besieged and... objects of the chemical weapons programme located in them have been moved to other designated locations which have been verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the Safira site was one of two locations that the OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the observation team, Ahmet Uzümju, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been faced by the rebels, mainly the Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alavit sect and the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other developments, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a severe explosion on the Wednesday at an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Frustration by the organizers of the Bali terrorist attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 deaths resulting from the Bali bomb in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been tried and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist region of Kuta, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including the explosion of churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they might insist that a person who was called “a bomber” for his reputation as an explosive maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Perth June Cortin who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack by Patec and his associates almost ten years ago.
Almost holding back tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing I have no grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched, placed in a parked van outside, immediately after 11 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar where a suicide bomber blew up an explosive backpack just 20 seconds earlier.
After the terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times while he was connected to the life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaa Islamia, responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Sachia, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali terrorist attack brought to trial.
He had been hiding for nearly ten years, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbasabad, where American troops killed former Al-Qaida leader Usama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence evidence had been given: Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much he had caused to others.
The verdict is delivered on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, to be held later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be many tears this year,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Early passengers can now use flight guesses (but do not call from mobile phones)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music without using mobile phones — according to the long - awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Authority.
But passengers should not expect change to take place immediately.
As soon as this change is made, it will vary according to the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wehrt at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAUs how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for crew members and the laying rules of devices to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of laptop electronics in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that had already submitted plans.
“We could approve, depending on the status of the plan, the increased use of electronic devices very soon,” said FAH.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft is falling to land and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and driving, declared by FAH.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Travellers, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We are truly tired of feeling “dependant in school” when it comes to this issue.
But connection to the Internet for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages, or downloading data will still be banned at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no Word with Friends — an intellectual Internet game to which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident occurred: the actor was withdrawn from the American Airlines airline for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on its way to landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the luggage compartment because they can hurt anyone if they fly all over the cabin.
The mobile phone calls will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission and not in the FAH.
FAUs may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national transport safety expert for CBS News, stated that cellular phones were still considered a risk.
“ Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FAS that they can interfere with cell phones when the plane is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The sectoral advisory committee established by FAH to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow the increased use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been put on FAUs to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the Democratic Senator from the state of Missouri Claire McCaskil, argue that there are no valid security reasons for prohibitions.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAH began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers — high-tech assumptions of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAH as being resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at a cruise height for several years.
Fixed-wing planes for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are equipped to make greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Vert.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals that are much lower than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when cross-posting pages.
But the signals get stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the entire airliner with their Kindle e-readers and flew on it to check for problems but never found them.
The members of the FAH Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Air Passengers, stated that he considered the device interference to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those reports were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAH allow pilots to require passengers to turn off the devices while landing on the instruments in reduced visibility.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step towards the passengers, who are now using a variety of technologies.
“We are glad that FAH recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Doe, director general of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to carry out driving tests
The driving exams will be available to private companies with their own computerized autodrome.
This is referred to by the “Commersant” with reference to a draft government regulation entitled “On the tolerance of driving”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such automobiles in Russia.
It is expected that students of such “accompanied” car schools will take into account the results of internal testing.
In so doing, the State Inspectorate will monitor the pass of examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the course do not first pass, the school will be denied six months ' privileges.
The technical requirements for automotives contained in the draft Government Regulation have entered into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also includes requirements for the training of two-wheelers.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass an urban traffic test to obtain category A rights.
In addition, since May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would have to be granted Russian rights after the examination.
The bird, thrown by air into a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea, was released back into the wild
The bird was released back to the wild after being found in a depleted state at an oil rig in the North Sea.
The trap was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdin last month and then released by the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) of Scotland at a rescue centre in Alia.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: “This water traps are likely to be a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has entered the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It looks like the bird's exhausted and was able to find shelter on an oil rig.
He added: "It was not possible for her to take off again, so they asked us for help."
The waterpaste was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is Europe’s elite prepared to do business with England?
The Business for British was launched in April with an obligation to bring business representatives together and determine what changes British welfare and jobs want to see in relation to the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of British business in size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be surprising to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with special attention to countries that are upgrading and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antimonopoly to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with a single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in Europe’s trading zone — even 40 per cent of large enterprises traditionally most experienced from all companies agreed.
The last and most notable — our survey of business leaders has revealed that a clear majority want Britain to pursue a trade-based and trade-based relationship with the EU rather than policy-based UK.
This result, which was observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on “significant change”, which will return power back to Britain.
High rates — a change in contract and a more favourable environment for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent vote in favour of remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to review the conditions for British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to employment and economic growth in Great Britain, and, as our survey shows, for business, this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's normative activities.
The U.S. Departments are listening to the pope's personal phone.
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the U.S. special forces.
New documents from Edward Snouden's collection show that U.S. intelligence was listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now he's getting a tight grip on Pope Francis.
His phone began to audition before he became head of the Vatican.
The election process for the new pope was also monitored.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The Special Service connected to the cell phones of cardinals who met in Rome to pick another pope.
The residence telephones where the convoy participants lived were also heard.
The American spies listened to all the chief applicants for the Holy See to prevent the emergence of a Washington-desired figure.
Panorama reports that the “large ear of the United States” continued to intercept prelate conversations until the conclusion of the 12 March Conclude.
In the United States, it is alleged that since 2005, the Archbishop of Argentina of Bergolio has been appointed as the future of the Pope of Rome.
American intelligence also followed negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Embassy of Rome continues to operate a secret team of CIA and NSA operatives who collect information on policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, calmly announced that it was not concerned about the American bug, even if it was happening.

The Olympic billboarder specially photographed
The Bank of Russia issued a memorable note on Wednesday about Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The dollar nominal is 100 roubles.
But bloggers on the web are already actively ironing about a memorable note.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on 30 October, they pointed out that the image of a banknote hateer can be found in the photos.
In particular, in a free repository of StockExchange, where the photograph is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsorp on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in an advertisement for RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote was performed in the blue and blue gamma.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, and on the other side is a kind of Olympic stadium and Jar Ptica.
The author of the bank note design is Pavel Bushuev, who won the Repin Arts Academy in St. Petersburg.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered: mining, frimile, and spring jumps from the spring, but eventually a snowboard was selected because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of the CB, the regulator does not care about the public opinion regarding the widespread dissemination of the image of the Snoubboarder from the Olympic note and is currently studying the situation.
In Gonicka, however, there is little concern over the noise around the Olympic note.
The head of the State Department of Public Information, Natalia Nikiforova, said that all the thoughts about plagiarity were funny.
A banker on a note will turn to the right, photos on the Internet to the left, clarified Nikiforov.
The man on the photo session to create the bill was filmed from different points, and then the final image was selected, and he was the character outside the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic bank note because the artist was paid a salary for work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion on the Olympic currency image was very positive.
The recognizability of the image on the bill - plus to move it forward - is regarded by Alexei Popowicz, executive director of the RusBrand.
It is difficult to prove a 100% similarity between images on bills and in photobanks, so claims against intellectual property are unlikely to be made.
The Olympic note first appeared in China, where a commemorative note of 10 Yuan was issued in 2008 at the Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced the Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their assumptions, next year's beer consumption in the country will remain the same, at best.
Even though businessmen originally expected growth.
For this year, sales fell by 7 per cent.
All of this was reported by the head of one of the country's largest beer companies, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beers, Isaac Sheps, at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demand in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It was a discussion of public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already decreased by 18 per cent, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry as regards the production and trafficking of beer, a drink with a low level of alcohol, reported Sheps.
In no country in the world has there been such a strict restriction on the beer market, an unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are allegedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
Pivovar visited that many of the legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse were not particularly effective, but there were still new initiatives.
More painfully, beer producers have been hit by the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks since this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two projections for next year.
Optimist is the one she's talking about: the sale of drunk drinks will remain at the same level.
Pessimist, another 2-3 per cent drop.
To keep their profits, businessmen have to leave the mass consumer class to the premium class, beer will become less expensive, but it will cost more.
However, the radical effects of a small amount of alcohol falling have not yet been seen.
"My observation is that the level of alcoholism remains about the same,," said Alexei Sotnikov, a drug doctor.
True, the percentage of patients who use hard drinks has increased, as has those who are alcohol-containing toxins such as Jaguar, while it was alcohol that dominated ten years ago.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car plant in Allyavowska.
According to the trade unions, all those who had been dismissed received compensation.
However, to a greater extent than the problems faced by workers, the question of reducing production in the region was raised.
At the meeting, ZaqSa Alexei Etmanov, a member of the district service, said that some 600 people had been reduced at the Ford plant in Allyvojka.
He said that this had happened in September, when about 600 people had left the factory under the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the organization ' s trade union.
Workers who chose to resign were offered “gold parachets” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority have left their jobs of their own free will.
But according to Etmanov, this number of people is a total night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be the case.
However, in the next two years, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programmes to support regional enterprises in difficult situations,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large decline in jobs when adopting the budget.
This information is neither refuted nor corroborated in Ford.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it shows up, we'll have to publish it.
Discussions about the reduction of workers at Ford's plant are going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to dismiss 600 people became known in September.
The plant had previously declared the suspension of the production of vehicles.
The reason for the plant was the fall in demand for the Ford vehicles in Russia.
According to Petrosta, industrial output in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4 per cent after nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile aircraft will be available during take-off and landing
New regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and airline landing have been approved in the United States, reports BBC.
United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and new regulations will be in effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connection for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft ' s radio equipment, mobile voice services will continue to be banned.
Air travelers are thus allowed to read e-books, play tablets and other designs, and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the anticipated impact of mobile aircraft technology and aircraft control devices.
According to the U.S. source, for example, current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight may also be reviewed in Britain.
A new name, the "Brat Circle", has been finally established in the United States.
This week, the black list of the Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbeks and an Israeli into the “Bratsk Circle”.
One of Russia’s most famous singers, Gregory Leps, is suspected of transporting money to group members.
There are 22 people on the U.S. blacklist who are involved in the “Brat community” and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
“The declaration of the “Brat Circle” is more about the attempt to unify divided criminal groups”, said Mark Galeotty, an expert on organized crime and Professor of the University of New York.
In his view, the “Brat Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian Mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who confirms the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti as a United States Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelly also agrees with Mr. Galeotty.
“If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization”, the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime refers to it.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotty suggested that the “Brat circle” would unite more closely the Russian thief in Aslan Usoyan's law, known as Dead Hasan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanavi and Zachariya Kalashova, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Deed Hassan, and another member, Temuri Mirzoev, came to be the nephew of Dedu Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not relevant to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them had rather shared common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, a scandal about the inclusion of Gregory Leps, Russia's favorite singer, Vladimir Putin, in the "Brat Circle", caught the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, and it has been decided why he was placed on such lists,” said the Spokesperson for the Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Chapter Gazproma Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The launch of the South Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks one of the largest energy projects in Europe, as stated by Head Gazprom.
“It is now a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Flow gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said President Gazproma Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The “South flow” is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute between Gasprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of the Russian gas for Europe, increases the risk to conventional routes, says officials.
Miller stated that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been removed “always”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Flow at a reduced price as soon as the project starts operating in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarait district, the driver of the Peugeot car set off at 115 kilometres of the Odesa-Reni route and met a bus with six people.
This is reported by the PPPS press office in Odessa.
The accident resulted in the death of a 31-year-old car driver, Peugeot.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured and his leg was lit.
Medical care was provided to the woman for the first time on the ground, and hospitalization was refused.
Emergency medical officers also examined all other passengers.
The rescuers picked up the bus and released the bus driver, whose leg was blocked at the bus door.

The police detained the shooter at Los Angeles Airport
The police arrested the suspect at Los Angeles Airport.
It was previously known that one of the airport ' s terminals had been opened with gunfire.
The police and rescue services evacuated people from the building.
The perpetrator was injured in an exchange of fire with the police, no information about his identity.
The police are looking for possible accomplices.
It is believed that several people were injured during the exchange.
It is noted that Barak Obama was informed of the incident.
Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission became aware.
Two members of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children prior to indictments in 2011 against a child care institution in Karingbach Jonathan Lord, who reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's introductory statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Hayra, was asked about one case where YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and another case where the YMCA sports instructor Caringbach Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Heir told Gail Fernness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in an introductory speech to the Commission, had also been inaccurate, claiming that “there were external YMCA audits that recognized that YMCA was at the forefront of children's security”.
The evidence provided to the commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of the four possible quality audit evaluations carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Heir, who had joined YMCCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that he and the executive had failed by hiring Lord and had failed to ensure a clear understanding by staff of his obligations to report violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years in YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hire rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations of children's security.
The officers testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord had been alone with the children, that he had taken care of them personally, placed them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and let them play with his cell phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by Lord Lord and asked for training in the protection of her children, because she was concerned about his conduct, testified that she had found Jackie Barnath, the custody manager of the children of the JMCA branch in Karingbach, who was Lord's leader, “very frightening and often difficult to access”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from staff members that it was not easy for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them away from the idea of the need to report him.
Mr. Heir said that he had presented his opinion to the New South Wales YMCA Board that the lesson for the organization from “the incident with Jonathan Lord” was not “an issue of information” on the part of staff members, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hire stated that the decision to force staff members to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictment had been made by Liam Whitley, Director General of YMCA for the custody of children.
He said that it was intended to prevent the deterioration of evidence, but it was “extremely” and the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during its 2009-2011 work by Jonathan Lord, informed the Commission by Professor Stephen Smolbon of Griffith University.
He said that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, training, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearing is postponed until 20 December.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
It's not just considered to be a manikin, it's a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bundschén had left her job for a while, after being distracted from her motherhood, she arrived on these days and this week the defiler arrived on a special basis.
For months, her absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Life remains the most highly paid supermodel of the world.
This time, she was involved in the "Kolcchi" defil.
Finyl Fashion Weeks is usually the most interesting show.
Sort of like the one who organized Lino Villaventura.
Marke is over 30 years old, in parallel with the production of the pre-port of the Lux class, the fashion designer works actively in theatre and film, making plays and making costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in textiles and fashion worlds participated in São Paulo during the final week of fashion.
This is one of the most dynamic areas of production, over 2 million Brazilians are employed, and the annual turnover is as high as $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
The previous night, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of the resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided British policy discussions, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the Quartet to Middle East peacekeepers.
In response to a question as to whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to London’s Evening Standard, said, “Yes, but it's unlikely to happen, so ...”
The chief coach of Milana, Massiliano Allegrey, deplored the nothing result of the 10th tour of the Italian championship from Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure of the launch was due to a series of injuries sustained by the leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, and it's Tmw Allegrey's words.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general, I can't say we've lost concentration.
I had to win.
Last season we met the challenge of getting into the champions' League.
Now we're behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries from key footballers.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The port experts who came to Cardiff to fight for "The Year's Prize" knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the arrival of Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, this young man and his drinker, the Shetland pony Toffi, had waded through three tours in order to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple — the same growth — were highly prized for their appearance, behavior, and style at an annual SanniBenk horse sport center in Rory, near Cardiff.
Upon reaching universal vision in front of men and women in beautiful hats, he pushed his cap on top of him and proudly held his cap around two years of Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for his years of innate ability to handle horses.
Toffie was highly valued for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday last March, and since then he's been engaged in Shetland ponies every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffie are beautiful duets."
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a bowl.
That was just his second talk with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
Very strange people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture of it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, which is close to Abb Weil in South Wales, walks along the steps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been carrying horses for more than a decade.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole public was amazed and everyone was shouting favorable calls and rumblings.”
He ran along the sand throughout the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his work perfectly.
Fenton has no mind about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he'll soon be taking part in Loshadi's year — and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibit said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their appearance and presentation at the show ring.
They appreciate the smoothness of the pony and the manufacturer, Fenton and Toffi, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive dress, and he was really good at his role.
The Chinese newspaper, which issued the appeal, “To be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued on the front line an appeal for the release of the accused in the reporter's slander, must be reorganized, reports the press controller.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express issued an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a state share of property.
The New Express now needs to go through a “complete error correction process”, as reported by the regulator.
The order for “error management” came from the Guandun Office in the areas of press and publications, radio, movies and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Young Evening News Group newspaper of the New Express had published a number of false reports about Zoumlation's registered company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The Guide to the New Express has been disoriented,” says the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporting licence”.
He also “encamped Young Evening News Group to make a full correction of the errors of the New Express and recommended that it investigate the responsible newspaper in question and immediately modify the leadership of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction company called Zoumation.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front lines, stating that it supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television with the confession that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoumlia as well as all the news media industry and its public credibility,” he said to the State broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my fault.
Following Mr. Cheng's confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front line, stating that the newspaper had failed to check his reports properly.
A number of high-level suspects recently made statements on television.
Experts said that the practice of obtaining confessions in China continued to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to talk about it.
U.S. Tunnel has been discovered — Mexico for the transport of drugs equipped with its own railway.
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico is found with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves ever discovered.
The tunnel, whose zigzags are nearly six football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with imperceptible warehouses, thus facilitating the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs, as stated by the authorities, were undetected through it.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, were employed as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they are liable to 10 years ' imprisonment to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels have been discovered in Central Mexico since the harvest of marijuana in October, which has made it difficult for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, equipped with rail routes, from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses of San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November this year, reporting to BELTA correspondent at the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection ' s main pension department.
As of 1 November this year, an adjustment will be made to the average wage of employees in the Republic applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding recalculation of employment pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase in pensions.
As a result of the recalculation since November, the average age of work pensions is estimated to increase by 5.3 per cent.
The average pension by age would be Br2 million, 295,000.
The increase in pensions affects 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection on higher pensions since November will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
In parallel with the recalculation of employment pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, promotions and benefits will be recalculated as a result of an increase in the subsistence minimum budget per capita.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 530 per cent higher than in effect from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, an increase of 2.1 per cent in minimum pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pensions will be made effective 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion-0- have been established for pensions based on increases in 2013.
British Police Sends Assanja Extradition Notification
The British police today gave notice of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assangja, who had taken refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian “a formal demand to surrender” with a request to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be further subject to arrest.
Assanja faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June he took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought political asylum from that South American country.
Scottland Yard “served a 40-year-old man with an official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at a police station every day and time of our choice”, as the Spokesperson reported.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the notification to the police.
Assang is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to make possible espionage charges after the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic dispatches on the anti-secretity website of WikiLeaks.
A driver driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs fined 1 000
The motorist was fined 1 000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between legs.
Andrew Howie, 35-year-old from Tiptri, Essex, was observed driving his Mercedes Benz on the A-120 road in Breintri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester Howie, the prosecution of the chief was without due diligence and consideration.
The addition of seven fines to his driving permit resulted in the receipt of a six-month ban on driving.
Howi has also committed itself to paying costs in the amount of $90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime in the amount of $100.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will lead to London’s bubble burst
Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital tax, but looked forward to a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who had introduced a 7 per cent tax on houses worth more than ?2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals in the 2012 budget.
To date, the State housing tax in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already higher than the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Habber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase of the tax on expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against obsolescence, it is very difficult to claim that taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system”.
“But this could lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners would not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate is at a price of 5-10% in the wealthy south-west London belt, which extends from Fulham to Ummbledon, rising by a record 11.8% in the last year.
According to a study by Savlls, prices in central London continued to show a steady increase of 5.6 per cent per annum, but they were overshadowed by an active “entity market” with rising prices in south-west, north-west and east-east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs push their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs wave their tail primarily to the left.
But scientists now say that other members of the dog family can observe and respond to these subtle differences in the appearance of their tail.
Professor Giorgio Wallortygara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people of the left and right side of the brain have different roles in the formation of incentives that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other kinds of things.
He added that just as a human has a right-hand part of the brain, the left-hand side of the body controls the other way around, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multitasking of the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured animal heart rate and analysed their behavior.
Perhaps we will soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Professor Wallortygar said, "We showed dogs a video of dogs -- either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the tail motion and direct the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw that in the rest of the dog had moved its tail to the right (in terms of the shining tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that their tail was predominantly on the left (newly from the point of view of a plumbing dog), their heart rate was increasing and they looked anxious.
Professor Wallortygar said he didn't think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience of what movements they should be concerned about and about.
He observes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tail flogging in one direction is more friendly and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert on dog behavior, John Bradshaw, an invited scientist at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to check whether the left and right dogs were relevant.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left if they looked at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they looked at a contented dog.
In another scientific work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was poured to the left rather than to the right instead of being alarmed, the opposite of Italian research.”
He said that the difference might be because dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals in movies or robots as dogs.
A useful study of how dogs react to true dogs might be helpful, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified and dogs are no exception”, he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Archaic Monkeys are delaying a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Archic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after her calibreist had been diagnosed with laringitis.
This Chieffield team was supposed to perform at Hydro City concert site on Friday.

This statement was made after the group had to postpone the LG Arena concert in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: “After taking a decision to move the show to the Brigham LG Arena tonight and after medical attention, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show to Hydro site at Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alexou Turner was diagnosed with laringit” and unfortunately he was unable to speak.”
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now be held on 20 November, and the Glasgow show on Hydro Square will be held on 21 November.

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will replace the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his ministry on 22 February, as he announced on Thursday the Vatican.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals at present.
However, after reaching the age of 80 as a cardinal, he is no longer able to take part in the election of the pope — the prerogative of the group of 120 “voting cardinators”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Spokesperson, Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all present cardinals known as the Consistor would be held before the building ceremony.
“Par Francis decided to report in advance his decision to convene a consortium in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, of Catholic Voices, said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to drop.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal voters back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The Consetory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected last March, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and particularly in favour of Italy.
“It would be interesting to see if the new pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who are mandated to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad decided on his own.
“Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that “it is possible” that Francis would look to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before — all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes used to be the cardinal of bishops from major parishes, but Francis “is a field of surprises — so we don't know who he's going to call”.
GM removes a number of new pics in the United States to complete seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models from 2014 to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in accordance with the Friday notification from U.S. regulators on vehicle safety.
On some peaks the front seats may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal safety standards for head restraints.
“The head restraint may fail to protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury at the rear of the car”, says the notification posted on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The release of GM pick-ups started in June and represents the most important launch of the vehicle into serial production for a leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pics owners of a defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider a notice to the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pick-ups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as stated by GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pick-ups and 16,503 Sierra pick-ups.
The GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday day until the $37.47 mark.
The cry of despair of Obama’s electorate
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said Obama had allowed the falsification of the Republicans to reverse commendable efforts.
Frustrationism cannot justify problems with the web site of Obama ' s reformed health system, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second - year student at Harvard Medical School.
I read a terrible book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me in my second year of depression and give me a sense of hope.
It's called "Victim for Victory" and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight and lie in bed, this book brings me back at a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and speeches may have captured the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programmes had paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents were keeping all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategies was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama ' s entry into office in 2008, its level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return is indeed a rude awakening, like a dream-throwing.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot paper, things have really changed.
It was something I couldn't imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the abolition of the rule of “Don't ask, don't tell,” the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party-based obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after so many times I took sides in Obama's administration, defending it with my colleagues and peers, I ended up explaining what I could do.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The falsification of Republicans cannot explain permission for foreign leaders to trap or attack innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistle-blowers exposing the Government ' s misconduct.
He cannot explain the killing of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awalaki, without trial and investigation, or the non-compliance with the limits of State funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration”.
More recently, he cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Access to Health Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the election is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and by random events such as the battle in Newton.
However, in all the examples I have mentioned above, it is clear that they were to a large extent a choice of administration.
And that's what's bothering me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidature.
Mitt Romney was an unclear and rude alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to make decisions on his own policies or views.
I assumed that Obama’s second term, free from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
This makes me punctuate on many of the promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes Clinton's downfall in Obama's initial election in Pennsylvania.
In an analysis of the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
Spouse billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnet, which has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement while he was trying to miss out on whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to eliminate carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be held by ministers and said that Mr. Abbot ' s daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters become pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they will receive leave,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner of the Sansain Costa election district of Farfax, with an increase of 53 votes after the conversion of votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure in order to expedite the process.
Tony Abbot Francis and Brigitte's daughters.
Should these elections be decided two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system”, he said.
Why don't we have to have a system so we can come in, put our data on the computer, vote immediately, and get the result back at 18:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of pencils in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is investigating possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sansaine Costa and he would be “very serious” in his new work.
Public office involves public service.
“We do not seek any rewards other than thanks to history for serving this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its currency unit, according to two people who are familiar with the situation, a further indication that global controls of alleged currency manipulations are gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations of the world's largest financial market, with daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS personnel to be suspended during the unfolding investigation, which is called the LIBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we cooperate fully with FCA and our other regulators”, reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, knowledgeable persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and instantaneous messages that had received and sent it to a former United Kingdom regulator, the Financial Performance Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as is known, was granted leave for his current position as head of European mortgages in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, leader of the Citi European Spocket Trades, left on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency traders in Barclays and UBS, was suspended from working by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's Contact Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable persons.
The Bank of UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finnma said he was investigating alleged currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies around the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antimonopo, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have agreed to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or requests for information from regulators spoke to persons familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking through instant messages and e-mails within a few years to find cases of crime.
The news of the audits has been generated by traders in the area of activities, one of the largest sources of revenue in investment banks in recent years, which this year, however, has been hampered by the fact that low currency volatility has reduced the opportunity for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that a broad and highly-like foreign exchange market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always the case.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous amount of daily exchange on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day that the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of the traders of his London Exchange Stock Trade Division this week, after he had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the authorities concerned and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the traders acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the Barack Obama Health Act is constitutional, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
In a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Public Health Act requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance prior to 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional under the tax authority of the Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the Court, while Judges Skalaa, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act that states should improve compliance with the Mediaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football's the cause of the discord?
In the context of the “Open rostrum” policy and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the suggestions were to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it was a game of scandal and discord.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled recent events in Birulje and said that in order to reduce the “price of public tensions”, politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinowski, who on one television threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers also referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which added to the debate ' s sobriety.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Birullev were “a model conflict that could have been predicted”, but “we have too many people and institutions for these questions” and seven baby-sitters have no eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe had long practiced against migrants had failed, according to the socialist, and it was necessary to find a way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes in a new single history book.
“There is still a need to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the people of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatar know that people live in Dagestan and vice versa,” he said.
Hennadiy Zuganov proposed that you be criminalized for "the call to dismember Russia": "If you say on the U.S. radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years' imprisonment."
Vladimir Girinowski was very careful not to fire.
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national problems to public debate: “There is little to say in dust debate.”
Vladimir Vassiliev, the leader of the Single Russia faction, immediately advised journalists to conclude a charter and agree to speak on the subject with care, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have adopted some 30 laws regulating migration, and the general order has been established, as stated by Mr. Vassiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for international peace in their territory.
But Sophia Andrichenko was not pleased with the law: it did not “explain clearly what adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and its limits are.
So the actors will treat these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary personnel to deal with such complex issues, nor do they have the resources, and the guidance they can use does not provide the centre to them ...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the formidable name “Department of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s led a similar agency, which was subsequently abolished, objected.
It's enough to have at the federal level a special person, a “minister without a portfolio”, who could be contacted if anything.
“We walk around, shells explode together, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak out against provocations together, and this work must be supported in a worthy manner”, said the representative of the RPC on relations with the Society of All-Wall-Wold Chaplin.
No State neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including, in his view, should be allowed to be religious.
Here, Oleg Nelov led the discussion to a surprise: "There are more talented people than there are in Chechnya or Dagestan to search for, but they are being driven to the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football: "So football guys beat the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades throw stones at each other.
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another kind of sport called grebes...
"They won't be happy in this sport in the world!"
There will be no one in the Rigabi in the Caucasus! Mr. Girinowski intervened immediately.
You can offer them some more driving!
We need to know about the national characteristics. It's like the Georgian "Sun" offers...
In Yarosławl, there was wild behavior in the stands by representatives of the Moscow Club -- during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned throughout the country...
The Head of the RFS Monitoring and Discipline Committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuba had been fined 500,000 roubles, transferring Philippe PAPENKOV from the home of the football correspondent SE.
Such sanctions against the red-headed club were imposed for the burning of Dagestan's flag by fans at the rostrum during the 14th tour house against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the FPFL.
We have examined all available materials.
A fine of 500,000 roubles is fined for misconduct by Cubans.
Google companies, Samsung, Huwei have filed claims against Northel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Northel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it paid at the Northel Bank auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which had purchased $4.5 billion of Northel patents, filed claims for patent infringements with the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huwi and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with a violation of seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help to compare search keywords on the Internet with their respective ads, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huwei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawi and HTC make telephones operating on the Android operating system from Google, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered $900 million for Northel patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel Rockstar patents case, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Despite a unsuccessful attempt to obtain the patents that are the subject of the claim at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them”, the lawsuit states.
Rockstar requires increased damages from Google because it claims that a breach of patent rights on the part of Google is deliberate under the claim.
In Egypt, the First Freely Elected President takes an oath
Mohammed Morsey is sworn, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsey promised “new Egypt” when he took an oath, became the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who had been overthrowed 16 months ago.
At its inauguration, the Mursi Supreme Constitutional Court also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes at a courthouse on the Nile coast built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic”, said Mursey during a solemn ceremony shown live on State television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old American-based engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that was most of its 84 years of existence banned by an organization that served as a target for the hard-core actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Murcy arrived with a small casket shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for only a short time to pass his convoy on a usually lively road linking the city's centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursey was ridiculed as a non-haristic “share wheel”, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to bring the 2011 revolt against authoritarian Mubarak to an end.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State”, said Murcy, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the elaborate wooden panels of the hall, where he took an oath.
Morsey later went to Cairo University, where he had to deliver his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that had performed a state giant, during which he stood on the stand “symbolly”.
A military official from Feldmarish Husain Tantai was present.
His arrival was met by the slogan “Army and the People One Hand”, which scandalized hundreds of assembled at the university’s main lecture room.
Founded in 1908 as a reference to secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became the foundation of Islamic student groups .
Mursey took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the rebellion broke out, ending the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the powers of the President, whose office he had been deprived of by the military council, which had taken over the case from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court, and not before Parliament, as is accepted, it does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Murcia’s talk on Tahrir Square was filled with the theatre’s populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tumen Association of Engineers took place at the Yalutorov Motor Vehicle Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of steel pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study was conducted in 2011 with the arrival of the new owner to study the market for steel structures in Tumensk State.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electricity pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the profile of the plant and its installation for production.
More than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped this year.
The investment in the factory amounted to over 120 million roubles, as Dennis Gribanov told us.
A new state was launched in October, which allows for an increase in the range.
The factory produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for heating, small forms of construction, and the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
The target is 50,000 tons of production per year, about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased - now 157, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is being retrained and the necessary specialists are being selected from existing ones.
Next year, a new longitudinal sharp aggregate of up to five millimetres is planned, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another condition, at the speed of the pipe production to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprise is going to develop the production of pipes used in housing and utilities.
Business management aims to close up to 70 per cent of Tumen's production needs.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy, Leonid Ostroum, appealed to the business managers to give more attention to the modernization of the engineering industry.
This includes forms of public support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of its lease.
This year, 150 million roubles are allocated, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will consider grant contracts, receives documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget provides for local producers ' participation in international fairs.
A budget of 150 million roubles is budgeted for the following year, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to fairs, three million to energy conservation programmes.
Funds for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment are reduced to 72 million roubles in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumova, this form of support will end in the long run, as its introduction has been motivated by compensation for the mining tax that oil companies have paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In this regard, the Government has given priority to direct support to industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil industry.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oil companies.
The grant for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the southern Tumen region industry, and if it is cancelled, it will be difficult to compete at a cost with the middle lane of Russia, where the labour force is cheaper.
In addition, the continuity of the new owner of TNC-XB, Rosnepht, which does not yet place its orders in Tumen's enterprises is unclear.
An agreement to implement the Uvat Project is due to expire in 2013 and no requests for extension have been received.
At present, enterprises in the southern region that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for a future year.
The question remains whether taxes will be received from oil originating in the Uruguayan region to the region ' s budget, or whether they will be paid at the location of the new owner ' s registration.
Tomić will serve 240 hours for an extremist social media video
The Lenin District Court of Tomska sentenced 240 hours of compulsory works of a city resident who had placed an extremist video on the social network and reported to RIA Novosti on Friday by a representative of the regional court press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was added to the federal list of extremists.
A criminal case was brought against him under an article of the Criminal Code entitled “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of the dignity of the person committed publicly”.
“The Lenin District Court examined the case on a special basis and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours' mandatory work”, said an agency interviewer.
She added that the man had fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of commodity prices following the signing of an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nicolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will decrease considerably after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
This was what he said when he spoke to his readers about his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This would mean that prices should decrease.
“It's about goods coming from EU countries”, Azarov wrote.
As for other products, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
But there should be no price increases, either.
Thus, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared in our country quite widely, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, are not quite true, or, more precisely, are not true,” summarized Azarov.
Investigators verify information about child abuse in Biysk
On 29 October, the media published a report that one of the kindergartens in Bisca had locked a child in the basement for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently looking into all the circumstances, as well as a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the charge of being foolish, Evgenia Vasiliev spoke.
Evgeny Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press on both the thefts in the Minoborna and on her personal relations with the Defence Minister Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
On 1 November, however, the Defence Service case violated silence.
In an interview, Life News Vasiliev stated: “It was, of course, just one task: to extract from me any negative information against the former Minister of Defence.”
There was a blackmail for me to testify, or I'll be put in prison.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of victory.
The interview concluded, however, that Vasilewa may have been the most likely to say that she does not have a taste.
It is likely that there is a statement by the official representative of the UK of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected in the Defence Service case involved counterfeiting.
Among the property arrested are a number of paintings that the hostess, convinced of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
However, an artifact commissioned by investigators following the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap counterfeits,” Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss certain personal matters?
I think it's just wanton," Vassiliev says.
However, to the question whether she admits to one of the 12 criminal incidents that she has committed, Vasiliev stated: “No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasiliev is avoiding the criminal case file, counsel for the applicant stated that he and his client “are not allowed to get acquainted with the case file”.
What led to the discovery of Vasiliev, still under house arrest, who had not yet communicated with the press?
How could a woman not answer the bad taste charge?
Or are the rights of Komsomolka journalists who claimed a few days ago that she had "falled into an even larger trance under house arrest" because of the report of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdukov with his wife and his return to the family?
A well-known military columnist, Victor Baranc, in his article “Serdukov’s Return to His wife”, wrote: “Seducators do not exclude that after such a shock, she may become more conversational in interrogations”.
In the past, Vasiliev had taken over some of the charges of illegal sale of real property by Minoborana.

The Flight Centre appears to have a reverse trend.
The company updated its full-year income forecast and looked forward to the record incomes from recreational workers in Australia and Britain.
This tourism firm now expects that its main full annual income prior to taxation will range from $325 million to $340 million, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current targets are met, this will represent a 12-17 per cent increase compared with the record return of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that FlightCente had received 8 per cent of its first half and started the second half of the year with good results, especially on Sunday visits to Australia and Britain.
“We have been operating with profit in our 10 countries since the beginning of the year, and for some of them, a record high return is expected for the full year before interest and tax contributions are deducted,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually bring us the largest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business was restored in the second half of the year, which compensated for a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the British business of LightCentre, leisure was good while corporate customers were less likely to spend.
Her business in the United States had compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, the FlightCentre stock grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, the barnaulian police identified two playing halls.
He was the first to work in the Industrial Region on the Street of Wothney.
At the time of inspection, there was a game in the institution.
There were 24 assault rifles at the club.
Another game club was found in Lenin District on Anton Petrov Street.
Twenty games machines were used here.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs reports that administrative materials have been prepared under the article “Illicit organization and gambling”.
The technician's been removed.
The evidence will soon be transmitted to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin Districts of the City.
In Ekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has mistreated two sisters.
Their bodies were burned after the murder.
The “New Region” was reported in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlov district on the eve of the day in the Krov district of the Ural capital following a fire in a three-room apartment house located on Uralski Street, where the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The identity of the victims was soon established.
It turns out that this is a sister, one of whom is a woman in Ekaterinburg for 44 years, and the other one is a 33-year-old resident in Orenburg province.
The burning apartment they rented a few days ago.
His investigation took control of Mikhail Bordeen, chief police officer.
The internal affairs authorities process different versions of the murder, verify the alibis of previously convicted citizens and those who are prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose women have rented their apartment and where they have lived before, what they have been doing, what they have been in contact with.
The schools called for greater attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also present “non-programme texts” to encourage more reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, pupils will be required to pass a separate graduation examination in language, with persistent recommendations for English literature selection as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to produce new training programmes on English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
A separate regulator in the area of examinations OFQUAL will present a revised structure for secondary school graduation examinations, with a new evaluation system and a smaller volume of exchange rate work.
In the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our system of examinations in order to restore public confidence”, insisting that school graduation examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week per quarter) than most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore spends about 138 hours in school.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to math schedules, the coalition sources said that large-scale high school math final examinations combined with a higher rate in the ratings table are likely to be an incentive for schools to provide additional training on this subject.
In terms of education, greater attention will be paid to “real-life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
Hayha tickets will cost visitors 2,200 roubles
As of tomorrow, tourists will start to carry ships from Pedestrians in Heiha.
For those wishing to go to China, this means extra costs.
Puma tickets are traditionally more expensive than heating.
The costs of the regular ticket are 2,200 roubles, as reported by Amurassmo's reference service.
Travel through the comfort hall would cost 2,800 roubles.
In fact, during this season, tickets did not travel — at the same price, the pumas carried tourists and the past spring, and a year ago, in the fall.
Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev believes that GDP growth is insufficient for the Russian Federation, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of credit for business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, reports Reuters.
We've been planning this year for GDP growth in the area of 3%, maybe a little bit more.
It's actually just less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of recession in a number of European countries, it seems like it's not very bad, but for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as it is in a number of countries, and indeed, for development to take place, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important for Russian companies, Russian business to receive normal credit at a normal price, the first thing to do,” stressed the head of Government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bovelle provides free health care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bovelle and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients
In this West African country, doctors are less than 1 per 5,000
Voice here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bovelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes so he can become a hero of the year CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bovelle saw his father return to life and fall unconscious again, running through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bovelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital.
At first, he had a broken arm, but his infection spread to the brain and caused him to come up with a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we would've taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, he accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they might have received.
“It's not easy, ” said Bovelle.
- You can leave home at 5:00 in the morning, run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first one.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed significantly since Bovelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians were able to contact a doctor, many of them would not have been in their pockets.
Two out of five people in that country lived below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health costs were private.
“Poverty is their only problem,” said Bovelle.
“And because of their poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing his father's suffering and so many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bovelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes visits to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others board their vans, attach medical supplies to the roofs and travel across the border to visit the villages in need.
They're not always connected to luck.
They've had to push cars through rivers and dirt on a number of occasions.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as true heroes — a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms available to the local people.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bavelle, with his broad smile and unbounded energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The team is starting to receive hundreds of patients the next morning.
“We accept 500 people on each trip,” said Bovelle.
They come from all over the district at a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-to-day clinics provides a variety of health services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may obtain brines, gift glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At evenings, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in the school, municipal or home building; after the procedure, the patients stand up and go to the post-operation area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operating and sanitary processing of equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but team commitment usually helps support village musicians.
“They're hitting drums all night to keep us awake and keep working, ” said Bovelle.
On Sundays, members of the brigade are going back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations during the past year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had received would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family”, the man said.
In addition to these clinical holidays and hospital work, surgeon Bovelle also works at private health clinics around Yaoundé.
This second work, he said, provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the remaining funds were covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Malley, medical student at Drexels II University in Philadelphia, volunteer at Bwell's team.
He's always at the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization so that he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, it's an opportunity for practices that they would never have had at home.
“We have been able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep tools for Dr. Bwell,” said O'Malley.
As a secondary student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own fare to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a severe test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise, is a source of great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job, ” said Bovelle.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it so people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretap
Bundestag Deputate Hans Christian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the discussion, the question was raised as to whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FWG Attorney-General ' s Office in a case concerning the possible wiretap of the German chancellor ' s phone by the U.S. special forces.
Snowden offered to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," said Hans-Christian Strabele, "that he knows so much.
Although the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden was ready to travel to Germany.
First, however, we need to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are starting to respond to a scandal around United States spies' programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir MacKay, told journalists at a press conference with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davutoglu, informs BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, and we have agreed that the two governments will provide widespread cooperation and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” said Vladimir MacKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, resulting in a protocol signed.
The Parties have developed a road map for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy office, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment fields, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy and the search for new forms and areas of interaction.
“The protocol of the past meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey see each other as a reliable partner”, he said.
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that in the ongoing negotiations the head of the foreign policy departments of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
In the view of the Minister, the trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, since there was no available potential in that area, he believed.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
As well, all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” noted Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama went to the spot yesterday regarding his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people had been notified of the end of service rendered by their providers, the Republicans had criticized the President for having misled American society in recent days.
Yesterday Obama somewhat complied with his initial public promise.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
With regard to what he called a “newsy” on the termination of services, Obama called on American recipients to seek other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance schemes at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
“You will have better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because they did not meet the new standards required under the Access to Health Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better,” said Sibelius in a speech to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Act on Access to Medical Care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site has been “very poor” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else, ” she said.
“I really want to get your trust back.”
An angry Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was caught by an included microphone sitting behind her in the chamber yesterday after a heated debate with Billie Long, a member of the House of Representatives, a republic of Missouri State, as to whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the “architor” of the affordable health care law voluntarily refused government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rasbolt has been dispossessed from the status of the media for non-licensing trousers.
On 31 October, Mosgorud decided to declare invalid the registration license of the Rasbolt agency, “Lenta”.
Roskkomnadzor, for systematic and gross violations of the Law on the Media, insisted on depriving the agency of its status.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent had been established: the court had considered it possible to close the media, in effect refusing to issue a counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbolt"?
The “Rusbolt Information Agency” was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened a second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also have offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rasbolt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognized private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rasbolt has always been a very specific niche, with the agency's core of exclusive publications being (and still being) a note referring to law enforcement sources.
Discussions over the proximity of the publication to the force continued throughout the Agency.
In addition to having a wide base of sources in various departments, the project was headed by Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherquesov.
However, the role of Chaplina in the “Rosbolt” guide is unclear: it is often referred to as “the project manager”.
The director-General of the agency is Larissa Afonin, chief editor, Nicolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, there have been no federal ratings for "Rosbolt" - either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the Russian media's website access rating on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, there are about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are notes of Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of a healer of the King and Laughing Group, the thundering in the capital of Biruele.
The conflict between "Rosbolt" and Roskkomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the Media Act came into force to prohibit journalists from having a non-price armour.
The authorities found prohibited lexicon in two videos published on the website (Jigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot desecrated oil rigs).
The other parties are described differently.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the video found, accused “Rosebolt” of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and asked the court to obtain a licence from the agency.
In Rósbolte, it was stated that the agency's claims were not valid: first, the ads were not editorial; secondly, the mother words were disguised in them; and thirdly, immediately after the prevention of the video, they were removed from the site.
The agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor before a world court, and when Mosgorud accepted a claim from Roscomnadzor on 22 October 2013, the complaints were still pending.
However, the 25 members of the peace judge had already ruled in favor of “Rosbolt”: the editor-in-chief, Nicola Ulyanov, found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 roubles - 10,000 per video.
Obviously, this predicated the outcome of the Mosgorcow hearing - if you gave up the idea that the outcome could have been pre-empted earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to declare the registration certificate “Rosbolt” invalid, effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
We can't say that "Rosbolt" remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the members of the State Duma (an application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, on 10 October, signed 26 deputies; the paper itself was submitted at the initiative of the CRC).
The President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gosev, and President of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the publication had not been properly closed.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roscomnadzor even gave him some assurance that the case would not reach the end of the license.
The “Rosbolt” trial showed that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia are safer today - a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capabilities, and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus, has completed the day before the deadline.
Before 1 November, Syria was required to destroy production and other supporting facilities for the preparation of chemical warfare agents for use, and was to transfer BBBS.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, toxic substances were currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack in the vicinity of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time, so as not to allow the Syrian authorities to make more chemical weapons, and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These capacity will now be closely monitored to prevent repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian applications will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They are willing to advise inspectors on new verification facilities if they suspect that Damascus is not fully revealed.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that it is the hands of Syrian rebels.
The world community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached under Russian mediation, to destroy or render unserviceable all capabilities for the production and filling of shells, gases and liquids.
Now that this phase has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the already available chemotherapy of the Syrian army.
It is estimated that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve and paralytic toxic substances, each explosive mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
In order to eliminate it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities need to agree on a timeline for action to begin, for two weeks.
The Director of Field Operations of OPCW, Jerry Smith, stated to the BBC that his inspectors had “observed personally the destruction of equipment”.
"They are now unable to continue to produce or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement stated that the inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and had found that the ammunition and poisoning plants had either been destroyed or had been inappropriate.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to be inspected there, as described in the document, but equipment from there has been transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical production infrastructure was “especially difficult” because it had to work in a context of ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, it was time for inspectors to celebrate it — they were too busy.
John Kerry says, in his unprecedented recognition, that the United States spy “has gone quite far away”
John Kerry has shown that the protection of United States surveillance programmes has been mitigated by an unprecedented recognition that, in some cases, United States spies “have gone far enough”.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “on a pilot pilot” at the time of Edward Snouden's exposure to the spy work of NSA.
These leaks of information have placed the United States Government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are going on on in the autopilot, because such an opportunity existed, both during World War II and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, 11 September.”
He then became the first high - ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the United States espionage had gone too far, but he stressed that no one had been violated.
He said: In some cases it has gone far.
The President was determined to shed light on the issue and to explain himself to people, and he was now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one had feelings of abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted well and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to explode.
There is a radical extremism in the world, a reckless and determined determination to kill people, explode people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented the crash of planes, the explosion of buildings and the killing of people because we have been able to learn of these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US spies abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, said the President of the Senate's Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It is indeed important for the interests of national security in the United States that the Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the First-Less Democratic President of the Senate’s International Affairs Subcommittee on European Affairs in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, even though the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other exposures included documents published by Snowden showing that NSA monitored Germany's chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Against this background, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would be composed of members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other lawmakers involved should be made available in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
While he stated that the purpose of the visit was to improve relations, he said that some degree of “best motivation” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they had been using for many years.
“While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities”, said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must go to the Middle East and Poland on this weekend to address the challenges of hostility to the United States strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
The influence of prison inmates will increase in the new composition of the public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) is in a position to approve new compositions of the public monitoring commissions (KON) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the militia lobbyors will increase their influence.
The NCB is a community structure that controls conditions in places of detention.
The case of Sergei Magnith and Leonid Razzaev, the disturbances in the prison in the country - it is through the NCC that most of the resonant incidents in prison are made public.
The NCC is being monitored by fighting between human rights defenders and militia lobbyers.
In the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the NCC, I suggested that the experience of human rights should be used as a criterion for selection.
"He didn't accept it, and he formed lists without developing the criteria," Valery Borshov says.
The current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - All-Russia prison human rights defenders structure.
As a member of the State of Apple, he has developed a law regulating the activities of the NCC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the membership of the NCC in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than 1,000 applicants for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria, competitions were not organized owing to the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize the pre-arrangement for vacant seats.
Moscow's NCC is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new membership instead of 20 participants.
According to Boršev, the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 members of the armed forces and, in the version under the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be admitted to the capital commission.
On the other hand, Vyacheslav Kalinin may be re-represented as a member of the Combat Brotherhood.
He had been a member of the NCC for three years, but had never visited the prisoners.
Borchev believes that by appointing his PNC Chairman, the militia will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unendurable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the movement of the security forces was coordinated by the member of the CNC Anton Zvetkov, who headed “Russian officers”, an organization that defended the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for traffic," said RBC daily Anton Flowers.
He denies that he lobbys for the promotion of any list and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition.
According to Zvetkov, he didn't even care what list they were voting for right now.
It considers the publication of Bordeaux information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Belgian NC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of past year's Copis' unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the local commissioner had ignored the prison problems.
But the RURV-na-Don's NCC can go from human rights defenders to Silvia.
The new lists of missing human rights defenders, the local commissioner, turned out to be one of his opponents, although in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had expelled him for ethical conduct.
The lists of Moscow and Russia's Boards of Borschew are considered as "a place for Copisk".
The revelations of the Hope of Toloconnikov did not affect Mordiviya's NCC, which is considered “strong”, but only one human rights defender wanted to enter the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
The Board member, Nicolai Swanidze, told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the council.

Australian woman appeals against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for false allegations that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket provincial court of filing a false suit after a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver had attacked her on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men had held her.
However, video cameras later found out that she had safely returned to her hotel after a breakup in her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford within two days before she confessed that she had fabricated the story.
Before trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bhamford was sentenced to 15-day prison sentences at the general regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not at the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanx, who sought help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for his daughter.
Tanx told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“It was obviously an alarming time, but we hope that it will safely return home as soon as possible,” said Tangs.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her leave in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that an appeal might result in a court raising her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of Australian Turkish Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand could also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, which would result in an acquittal.

Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosays.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern - day stories and headlines has caused heated controversy among critics in many different areas.
It may be argued that the combined articles on the Senegalese prose and umblica, its review of books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to critics Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about what the participants understand by the word “literacy”, as they see the present and future not only of our verbality but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and overview articles are generally provided in the sections “Abrasians ...”
