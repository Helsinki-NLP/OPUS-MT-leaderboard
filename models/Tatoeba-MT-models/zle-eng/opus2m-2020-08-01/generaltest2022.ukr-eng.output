Good afternoon, I'm sorry I didn't have the Internet and I couldn't send it faster.
Would you please tell me the exact address of tomorrow's cleaning, what code to the keys and what hour tomorrow visitors leave and new guests settle down?
Unfortunately, I have to give up your offer, because I've really found a job by now.
I'm sorry, but I can't say no.
I sometimes feel that because of my Czech - language translator, my thoughts are different from those of my English version.
We promised you'd be surprised if you went to school.
Good morning, I'll take the course.
But please tell me, is there any time earlier?
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be transportation problems.
If there's no option, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people came back to the meeting, the Russians didn't have time to go.
The Westerners told the agency that they had been able to hold a meeting before military raids and equipment arrived at the site.
"We've had a meeting. "We've got a job going on here now," said one of the Westerners.
In the past, the city had traditionally met in protests in Liberty Square -- near the DAD building and around the field.
This area, like the building, is now controlled by the armed Russian forces, which are using weapons against rallyers and kidnapping people.

According to Ucarinform, residents of Donecchi regularly carry out peaceful protests against a Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against men, are wounded and detained.

I also found work to clean up two cyvarteries, which are handing over to tourists.
The apartments in the center of Prague are there.
You'll be comfortable Monday night with me at the bank or another day.
Good afternoon, it'd be nice if you could today as you wrote at 5:00 p.m.

God give it to me to make a good trip.
When you get here, call me on the phone, the doorbell doesn't work.
It's cheaper... we're forced to move because we don't cost the European prices...
I need to look around and see where it hurts.
He wants to push on all my painful points right now, he knows which.
But it's not me anymore that has absolutely no influence.
I didn't want to talk to Misha yesterday about him and his drama.
It's impossible to close the banks, it's rainless) when there's no rain yet.
So I just feel uncomfortable in my own body.

Maybe we'll change Valya's change, Valya in the morning, and I'll be in the afternoon.
Mom's gonna live here in a dorm just like she's paid for the dorms.
It's important that I have a place to live.
Sasha wasn't in school today, and I wrote to my teacher for mail.
Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to take our meeting next weekend, sorry.
I'm good at cooking, but I like drinking.
In Ukraine, the traditional is boar, cookers, and others.
I don't have my favorite foods, and I like to try all kinds of different dishes in different countries.
What's your taste for food?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, there's no place.
I'm sorry, but we're a little late.
Lucia, can I have a helper in the kitchen?
It's very good that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very written and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me whether or not Nazar will be working for the beer shop and when he has to come to make an appointment.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopolis — the heart of war, stop fighting — we will have weak positions
President Vladimir of Hellenski believes that the fighting over the east of Ukraine and, in particular, over Mariopol will determine the course of the war – and if the FAS is defeated there, the Russians may abandon negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
Directly, Mariumpolis is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have pulled a lot of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupola, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the EPA, and if they're stronger, then the table of victory will be closer to us and we'll have the advantage of talking to the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we are now deposing.
They can go along with it.
Then our victory situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we're making a statement.
We believe in our outcome, our victory..."
The Greek also said that it's difficult to negotiate after the Ukrainian torture, but "we must not lose opportunities for diplomatic solutions if we have them."
The real question is, "People will perceive peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any kind of peace under any circumstances.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight – but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, no people."
Hello, do you have any more seats for the Czech course for adults from 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday?

Because of the changing esthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
It's just an analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, a state study.
English poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for a post-modernist context to be analysed as one where metaphor is an axiological criterion

The main intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military officers who have participated in war crimes in the Bush district of Kiev.
According to Ucarinform, the Chief Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defence reports this on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 military personnel from a separate mobile brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha, which is described in the report.
The MoU states that all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be held accountable for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine.
You can view the list by reference.
According to Ucarinform, Irving, Bucha, Gostomel, and the whole Kiev region were released from the Russian Zealots.
The released cities and villages have recorded massacres by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city’s head, Buchi Anatoly Fedouk, reported that 280 people had been buried in their brother’s graves.
The Attorney - General of Irina Venedictova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from Russian exiles in the Kiev region.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian troops shoot and destroy key infrastructures, carry out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, jet fire systems, ballistic missiles, aircraft bombs.
Good morning, I'm sorry, but I can't work because I'm coming to Canada shortly.
Immediately after the dash, there are formal names, slashes are slung expressions, parentheses are the abbreviations used on the time schedule.
I don't want to bother you, rest.
I watched the weather forecast, it'll be cold.
I don't need brandy.
It's just a nice dress at normal prices and to be sized.
We were at the train station at the store.
There are jobs that are offered, and it's possible without knowing the language?
It's important, if there's a tradition like this, I need to know if I'm going to prepare)
I've been thinking in a week, but we're going to be in trouble.
Tomorrow may be a bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to everyone for their experience, even if he is painful.
I think I've learned from every situation so I don't want to make mistakes.
The directives are in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of the Rules.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many are likewise celebrating this week.
That depends on religion.
Whether a man is a greco Catholic or a Catholic.

We promised you'd be surprised if you went to school.
It's great, I have money for two months to rent, the Olomouc district doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of atrocities against civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of people killed and shot have confused the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how could this happen in the 21st century?
I'm not surprised at all, but it's exactly what I've been looking forward to with sadness.
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girl-collegs with the children, and only then did they return to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I've been able to help my family consistently, and I have no doubt for a moment that if I occupied the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and I'm absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-CDDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist; it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Gitomir.
A few years ago, a Jewish SS was given a copy of an angry case involving a great great - grandfather — over a hundred pages on the right, and a death sentence was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was illiterate, denied.
The ethnic Polish, the Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-two" highway, never went to the cogs.
The fact that there were several cows on the hustle was enough to condemn the peacock and the feeding of young children to death.
The relatives did not even know where to bury them.
Grandma said that she had taken almost a hundred people from the village and had killed everyone except two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's a name for Shari's knockout in the penal case.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I won't be surprised if his relative was a KGBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree is, as is known, falling...
The angry trio that condemned the execution of the peasants were the ethnic Russians.
As he examined the case of the great - grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There's great information resources in Russia, like the Exclusive Barack, which are very similar to what happened in those years.
So in modern Russia, the descendants of CNARists found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found children's pornography files on their computer, and they put them in jail, and then they died.
KGBists are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about crimes of the past century.
Why, then, do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
There is a concentration of the most infamous traits of human nature.
A thousand-year-old Ordinian tradition was inspired by slavery and imperial chauvinism in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then on top of what happened, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at the half-French movie "The Checist" in 1992, that's what happened.
So you saw my pictures in the dome.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids are, because Gala can't find them.
Do you love Igor asking if you're comfortable leaving tomorrow? (he's leaving and he can go because he hasn't seen the station yet.)
It's very uncomfortable for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

And I have a problem with it if I don't love a man.
Yes, we took our aunts home and took them right away.
She was very grateful and cried.

The tears were in her eyes.
She said if it could be some old blanket and pillow.
But I don't have to do that, but if I do, I'm very grateful to you, too.
I was really sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had many questions about God, why situations in my life caused me to lose confidence in everything.
I need to buy bread and other food.
I just decided to go and you made congregations.
That's right, but we don't know where we are yet. We're looking for an hour and we're back on foot. Two blankets aren't suitable, so two and we need a big size.

According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 bucks, including a study kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is suggested in the APC boxer version for 1.2 billion euros.
While combat tanks have to climb relatively close to the enemy’s targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government community, with reference to KMW proposal, the supply of self-invasion gabbies will follow a circular pattern.
The Bundesver in the shortest possible terms will give Kiev 100 of its gabs, and the gaps that formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new ones may be delivered 30 months after the contract was signed, or sooner than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.

I teach doves in a pot and fill them with this sauce.
It's about 1.5 hours in the oven.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring it all in.
Monday 4.
4. In 2022, war refugees in Ukraine can request humanitarian assistance at a new location in the Office of Work in the Prague Market.
The branch in Room No. 29 is specifically designed to file and process requests for help, so there is a translator on the ground.
Lydia's in school, but we're going to a teacher on Tuesday.
I'm sitting, I'm holding my earphones, I'm listening to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how do you do?
I know it's hard for you.
But I treat it like we're together, that we're couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
That's why I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I don't know what's gonna happen to the house.
I need to go to a food license test.
Please tell us to prepare an apartment tomorrow for five guests.
Fifth place, I mean, in a room with a TV?
Laying and putting in the couch?
Can we stop at your place while Mrs. Margaret finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that was used, but he's a worker, but he doesn't need to..
Write the address in Czech, look at the map where it is from.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan with furniture I want to finally look at that apartment this week and then figure out what furniture I need.
Sorry I've been answering for so long, working day, hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have this opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how good it is.
For a kid, there's already a bed and a bathroom, talking to me for the first time.
Don't forget you promised to help me, how you'd be able, but don't give me the last time.
I want to make a haircut called a cap.
She's sick, she's sick, she's sick, she doesn't want us to see her, she doesn't have to get infected.
I'm the only one I'll be a little later-- about 8:00, can I?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried it's okay!
Because we haven't even talked about it with these excarasies!
I understand how important it is to you!
And I'm not talking about myself. (This is just a summit for me)
How are you feeling today?
Hey, sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Cola and I had begun to do a bad job of translating the test yesterday.
I'm going to ask if Gregory Denissenka or Jonashek) to help me with some mathematical ideas.
Can I help them?
If that's possible, I want to pick up math for the weekend.
The geometry is complicated at all, but we have to work with Cola to make sure that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We hope so too.
She's so happy about any gift she's ever given.
Jab wants to connect the Internet to his Czech number
I met Victoria, Ukraine, at a 402 - bus stop last night.
This girl is a child, but she's alone... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed that we would be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this little girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine to feel my love for each other.
The branch in Room No. 29 is specifically designed to file and process requests for assistance
Turns out I ordered a back card.
Don't do it, I'm just a human being.
So she wouldn't be afraid no one's coming.
I didn't walk.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago at the Holocaust Memorial Center, Babin Jar, in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yare.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial unity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must protect is also part of our responsibility with regard to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle has to go on."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and caused them to die of disease.
Russian troops have carried out large-scale shootings of Ukrainians, even in a visual way, like shootings in Babin Yare.
For over a month, the Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been possible so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than speaking out against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way out without risks and victims to conquer evil and to stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night.
We agree, make arrangements for a tour, and write down when to be gathered.
All were sick only Lydia did not get sick with an omicron new form of clothing.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using it instead of kar
Count the late documents.
A ticket cost me the 2000 Gwen guide.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO membership and only 18% of those surveyed were pros.
After the Hyde Revolution, the escapes of Victor Janukovic, the Crim's notes, and the beginning of the war of Donbasey, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, and the supporters, on the other hand, grew.
Since the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens — over 75 percent.
Despite support for Ukraine's entry into NATO and for NATO's war aid, there are now many criticisms about the Alliance and country members – for the late delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to “encourage” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up the desire to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of "Claim Questions" with the editor of "European Truth" we're talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the time of the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticized and why the Alliance is being criticized for nothing, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in victory with Russia can be the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think's going to happen here?
I've got a partner in my volt that my application is pending.
I gave it to her through this mobile app.
We don't have visas, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it because it was formed in Poland, it was not given visas, it was given dogs.
Let's write to you!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I arranged with the boy from Ukraine who met yesterday to meet him at school to show him everything.
So hopefully he's got it all right.
Because I don't like it, I don't have enough for long.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine
I'm going to leave the kids alone waiting there for three or four years and going home because I can't leave anymore.
I'll take you with me for 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do so well, and I left him.
After a while he returned and apologized.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he telephoned that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
Then I started having problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me back then.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
Thus, God himself has determined our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very happy to have a place to live and a place to be with a baby.
Ever remember me?
(Laughter) Because I was helping to look at children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write that sentence.
I understand for myself that the translator does not always correctly translate the text
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, or should she give the paper?
It must have been the guests who forgot, I put them in the closet.
It's probably time you went to bed to work tomorrow.
Whether someone can help, needs things for a woman of XS or S height 165. And also for her daughters (8,10,12) Thank you.
I bought two packs in ice and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You gave me the mood.
All right, give me something else, and I'm still awake, and I'm still asleep and I'm dreaming that I'm going to bomb...
God is never late, all of his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand very well the price of unskilled work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home is not going to get here either.
But just sit down and do nothing, 'cause then all the bad thoughts in your head go wrong, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are being processed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4:00 in the morning.
So we took them to our home.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and accompany them to the Airport.
When you have him, write and you'll find out what's next...
I can't find a place anymore.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian children's invitations to gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, text me when it's convenient.
I'd like to have kids in kindergarten and in school, of course.
We've been planning this, and it's better that we sometimes change things?
I'm sorry, I don't really have any missed calls from Wednesday.
I'm offering work, cleaning baths and toilets, washing three windows, cleaning dust.
It's about three to four hours.
I hope I'll tell you just now we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
Grishko started coughing, and I want to ask you what I can buy from the Pharmacy.
I want to ask you some advice.
We have Anna as the root name of Anja.
She passed her uncle out of the house.
Made an English version, added new partners
Write him if he needs anything.
Just don't forget about me, please.
Monday and Wednesday are different?
Thank you very much, you're doing a lot for our family!
Help is needed to stay in the pool
But that's my opinion.
She's out of my uncle's house and she's handing over the skates and the skating board, and she's on them at home, so it's got her.
I'm up at 9:00, too, and I'm preparing breakfast right now.
I'm very ashamed you're talking to me about your weekend.
We want to report the change in apartments, and we want to give the documents to continue with the map.
We're now providing medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you I'd have a snack for tomorrow.
One mother said it's hot for kids to have jam donuts.
He's coming to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments one month ahead of you, even though for close understanding on what days?
I don't remember this schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kiev, saying, "We haven't done this before."
Right, Konashenkov's real language, "We see attempts by the Ukrainian troops to do diversions and to target Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been held.”
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the early days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that struck down the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a apartment building in the capital.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multistory vehicle on the Providery of Valery Lobanowski.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television station near Babin Yare, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian PPO systems hit the South Railway Station with Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building.
On March 14, pieces of bombed - out missile destroyed a building and a Trolleybus on Curenitz in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a dwelling array on Vinogradar, killing one person, and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles razed the modern TRC Retrovillee on Vinogrard, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitaliy Kličko, announced again on April 13 that the residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city were too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kiev, and there were many mines and unexploded ammunitions in the capital area.
On April 12, the Ukrainian Department of Defense Intelligence warned that the Russians were planning to promote a series of terrorist attacks in the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil bomb exploded near Belgord in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgrade claimed that a Ukrainian projectile had fallen near the city.
Evidently, the elites in Washington, D.C., and Berlin are throwing them into cold sweat from the very thought that the national fighters will strike down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Selensky does not speak to them as much as to their voters and their societies in general.
By speaking in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds on the square of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors could have been reached.
The Greek does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, but he will convince the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these talks, this elegant alloy of strength, touchingness, and times of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Byden is categorically opposed to closing the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against Ukraine’s accelerated introduction, the process is already under way.
I understand, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The costs you collect are better given to people who need more.
I can come here and I'll decide if I can help you.
But the air's clear, that's plus.
It says I've got a two-on-one tariff, I asked you to make the Internet as soon as you can.
I don't understand the tariff conditions.
Do we have any other room today, or, as usual, just the stairs from above?
So I'm on my way and you're on the train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're all for me.
A financial consultant is involved in this loan.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked about the Internet, could I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot each other
Super then my husband's gonna drive me because he's got a car today from the construction firm where he works.
We are so happy and grateful that our Nick and your grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
one has to be cut into four parts.
one of these particles can be used for two to three days, but every hour it takes a break.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm so glad you're all right.
At 4:20 p.m., it's likely that the concert will begin at 6:00, and then I'm free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make some tea and grab some candy.
I went to the school page and now I'm gonna try and order Ania dinner for tomorrow.
But I love going out on weekends.
So we can go over there tomorrow, find out what's going on?
My name is Sasha, and I came from Lugansk to Prague.
I'm a certified masseist and nurse with 27 years in neuroscience.
I'm offering cure massages, rehabilitation training halls for children and adults.
I speak Russian, Russian, and Czech intensively.
Contact: -- -- and I'd like a letter so that Czechs can write to you through a translator, SMS doesn't go, they don't have Ukrainian keyboards, and if they call, you won't agree.
You really don't want this pry?
He is very much helping people to see what they are worth and what they have to do.
If you don't need a pros and cons, I won't put it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write me tonight... for some reason.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.
More specifically, I'm asking for attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan to buy, take vacations.
You have dreams.
You're going to buy this dress that you saw at the mall yesterday.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your track can't take it.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You'll call your job, find out if you're going to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
As long as it becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
They'll... agree... something will happen.
Mosog refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone to go anywhere.
I have $50 in my pocket, everything we've spent at home.
Many of our leaders have failed to pay our wages on our jobs.
Where am I going?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything wait out of your house... you drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know how to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till evening, you take the children all over Prague.
I don't know, kids ask for sweets, and you can't.
And of every ounce, we don't have one.
We've got a choice to stay there and put the kids at risk or try to escape here.
She was very happy with those hearts and the things the kids gave her when she came to school.
I should have called when you came.
I'll write you in dinner.
Yes, I believe in God and believe in him
I'm no longer strong enough to do it all.
I already thought you fell in love with some Ukrainian girl and didn't have time to talk.
I've broken it down, I've already ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what kind of species?
Please send a visa or cross-reference page.
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libush, did you pay for the yeast?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing us so much good...
We owe you a lot of debt... thank you!
Yeah, I know it's very good.
I'm going to drop you a picture of a lady card I'm learning English.
Well, you'll write tomorrow, see if you're going to see each other, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning, we've got enough money, it's nice to know a person from Ukraine.
If you want to, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow?
What You Have in common since the first week
Karina brought us medications the other day, and we drink them.
I can work with lying sick and disabled children.
But I'm sure I'm only talking Russian and Russian.
I don't have that.
I could sell you some soap for the milling.
Because there's only gel antibacterial.
I can't tell if I'm not going too far into town.
What services/activities do you think are needed/not available for the elderly?
I don't know, because I haven't had text from the bank yet and I haven't taken a bank card and the kids removed a bank attachment from it. They really upset me.
Then write me please, how you go.
Today, we have joy -- our city, Bush, was freed from the occupations, and our armies were set in motion.
It's a clean-up from the enemy, looking for Russians on basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the demining work will begin.
And John would've seen if there was something to be repaired or something to do.
Diane, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our Panas wants to stay home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We're going to have a pasta and do some lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their rooms and shops.
They're tractors that actually go to the field under the gunfire, because it's time to sow.
They are bus drivers who now agree to drive rubber trains to temporarily occupied territories to take relief supplies there and take people from there.
They are heroic leaders who go safely to the war zone, calm and help the refugees in their cars, and at peace stations help the volunteers load a humanist in their cars.
They were gas stations who stood on the Gitomir highway during the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities who carry garbage out by firing shots, repairing water lines, and power lines to provide needed supplies.
They're doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and they're volunteering at the free time to collect pharmacies on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of juice when we have little leaves.
Say, please, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's eight years old, is this the right age?
I'm looking for a home for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to come to Czechia and hand over my visa passports to Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw at the visa center and they don't work on-line queues.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's a long way off, it takes a lot of time on a train, it's gonna be hard for a kid.
So I decided to find a place to live in or near Prague.
No, it's okay.
Yesterday's instruments to bring in
But I can't change the password when I follow the link because I get this wrong:
It's in the microwave, something's burning.
In Ukraine, the largest banks always have 24 hours a day in contact with customers, and all questions are resolved quickly:)
Nothing, I'll get used to new realities.
I don't like it, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post, the most important thing is that it's true.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to respond to some Czech guys at 1:00 a.m. and help us move.
I want to go to you and hug you and kiss you.
At 7:30, I read the history of the World Theatre to Actors, Directors and Theatres.
Tonight I appreciate things. After dinner.
The mushroom is still asleep, crying very much at night, licking its tooth.
I'm on the phone with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people have died.
Czech Republic began to issue visas after March 22, after mine.
By that time, they had put the images like this and then compared the images to the cart.
Ukraine ' s foreign electoral district (HUD) is an electoral district that unites the electoral areas outside Ukraine and consists of voting facilities in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and facilities at military bases abroad, [Woman 1] in which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Coso and Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea are located.[1] The role of the district election commission for the Foreign Electoral Region is performed by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral Region, only State-owned elections are held: presidential and national elections and all Ukrainian referenda.
Local elections are not held in the U.S.A.
They're at the station near the mother's and child's room.
Says he doesn't know where to go anymore.
Are you angry with me?
I'm gonna go take a picture from the bathtub.
I don't need any more money from a friend.
I wanted to say I've already reached the Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device, I went to operator O2, and they made me an electronic SIM map that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, I'm working Sunday and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, bush blankets, plates. Children don't have pajamas and don't have anything to do with them.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10-- write another address where text is missing.
I don't want to torture you or me, I'll beat myself up with this.
That would be good, but I know there were no free places, and in principle they now have all the lessons on schedule, and they teach quite well.
We have, but it doesn't work.
Let's have it after Easter.
Yesterday, your mom said you had a pain? (Laughter)
She can't tell them everything she wants, and not everything knows what they're saying.
I went to school today too.
Today I saw Christina’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very delicious apples, what kind of apples are they?
President Andrey Hermack's Chief of Staff reported that Russia was starting a "fee operation" on the weapons that the Allies are handing over to us.
Hermak's direct language is, "They understand that they're losing war, seeing their backwardness, and trying to "kill" arms transfers by whatever means.
For example, one of the last fairies is the destruction of Slovak-transmitted ZRCs C-300.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know the Russian scenarios, and I'll call one of them.
They can launch fairies that Ukrainian soldiers seem to have guns from allies, and they masseize into the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you right away of these fairies.
Because the weapons in the hands of the U.S. soldiers are only sending the enemy to this world.
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask how much bulls would cost a garden in the moon and would it work in the summer?
Everyone is given according to his power.
There are far more sad stories, believe me.
So I had to survive to change.
In the Torah it is written, and God created a wicked beginning in man so that during the course of his life he might change spiritually, become better
This is your home, you can invite whoever you want.
How can we find this lady on the social media tomorrow before we go to the hospital to visit the town hall?
He listened to Mom and didn't come with us.
I know it was hard for you.
And I'll make sure you're happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you mean it seriously.
I've been watching the ad for a long time. Now it's hard for us to have that destiny.
I'm sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you get a call today about changing the mobile operator's tariff?
I'm sorry, but I can't expect anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I've already agreed to work there.
Thank you for your response and I wish you a nice help.
Your father may have told us that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I don’t practice any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions whose foundation is love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and began reading Toru.
I believe there are no mediators between man and God.
You might think about putting the refrigerator outside the door into the boys' room.
I thank you so much for helping me.
We're looking for sedatives for the usual cleaning of housing here in the village.
The proposal is 150 kroner an hour, another collaboration with them, and the date is agreed with the lady.
I'm afraid of chemical care, and I might be examined by a doctor?
I'm just worried about how we communicate with you.
But we can just look at each other.
I was going alone, to my mother's house, and there was a sister and a friend going to go, and Anastasia asked them out.
Where do you have a good hairdresser?
Good afternoon Victor approved this house only doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the papers to get a fee from the airstrip and said that with a bank of furniture yet there's no furniture available.
But I'm very grateful for your hospitality.
We've got good doctors here, too. Bye.
We've been cooking at home, and we can't find the keys from the attic.
I'll take the underwear for the fifth guest, and the pillow and the blanket are in the apartment?
So how do we connect to the owners, there's no contact, I need a long-term apartment, we work, we can pay, help if we can.
At the end of each description you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator from English to English and vice versa.
Anyway, we're four on one bed in a room where you can't even use it, thank you very much.
Well, did you click the links I sent you above?
On each of these, you have a free supply of housing, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find a contact just an e-mail, but I don't know what kind of house is closer to the Czech Krumlov, we have work in the Czech Krumlov and now we live in Prague.
I can't help you, Branny doesn't have a chance.
Thank you for your help, we've found a place to live, but we need a bed and a couch, maybe tell us where we can buy a budget that's not expensive because we're weak, thank you very much.
Can't you tell me that you don't eat well and that your stomach hurts a lot too?
I saw your publication on the Music Project.
I'm a Khormeester at the National University of Drahamanov.
I'll be happy to cooperate.
Meanwhile, Russia has placed its missile complexes on the border with Finland.
They want to try not only Ukrainian penis but Finnish too.
I'll be the happiest when I'm with you.
When I wake up next to you.
I kiss you and say, "Good morning, my love, you look very beautiful."
Where can I buy a moving ear cap?
There's a lot of work to do today.
We're not keeping you too late?
Why don't you give me a prescription?
It's enough for you to talk about, and I want to understand you.
I'll take a look and I'll tell her.
But it's good that everything's good for you, or else it can't be!
She's lying on her bed, Saszko does her cooking balloons, maybe she'll feel better.
It's a very heavy dough, and it's a glaze on top.
It says there's a request for humanitarian assistance.
The application must be filled out in the C.E. Department of Management.
And show me this bar code.
So I made an online request, but I have to go to the Office of Labor.
I'm planning on Monday.
I bought a number in the water pool.
On this day, my Slavic is very missing.
Are you coming back tomorrow?

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine and Moscow has rejected these reports as “propagation”.
“Reports of killed, raped and seriously injured by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation”, said New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jasinda Ardern, to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they did”, she added, noting that her Government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kissida, called incidents “a violation of international law”.
Statements were made after reports were made that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into fraternal graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bouchi by Russian troops who had left the area after their occupation for weeks.
Photographs of alleged execution of civilians with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for more sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
President Emmanuel Makron of France announced on April 4th that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bush.
“What happened in Bush requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures”, said Makron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain stated that Russian troops could enter so far as they had committed “genocide” in Bush.
“We will make sure that those who commit these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sánchez said in Madrid.
On public television late April 3, Russian MoLA spokesman Maria Zakharova rejected the charges as a "propagation."
She said, without proof, that the United States and NATO had “reserved” images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after these materials were made makes no doubt about who “said” this story," said Zacharov.
In the past, the Ministry of Defence of Russia also claimed, without proof, that Buchi's image was “a further building of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "the provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bush.
The Russian Investigative Committee issued a statement on 4 April in which it announced “investigation” on charges of Ukraine's “notification of false information” of the actions of Russian troops in Buchi.
On April 3, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir of Green, accused Russian troops of “genocide” in the city and told the Kremlin leaders that they were supposed to come to Butchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders being carried out," said Greenski in a video release, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures, for shooting in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers should be held accountable for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 20 miles [35 km] northwest of Kiev.
A Ukrainian Radio Freedom correspondent saw civilians on the streets on April 2.
In just one place, a correspondent found up to 10 bodies on the street.
And AP journalists saw at least 21 people in different places in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- everyone in civilian -- were scattered on earth near a place that the locals said was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a distance.
In general, Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the Kiev area, which had been controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything by list.
They said, "Kyeva's gone." How the underworld took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There's another item on this list that's at present much less information about: the removal of the local population to the enemy's territory.
About the middle of March, Russian occupiers are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied areas into their territory and territory of Belarus, which self-declared President Lukashenko has actually turned over to the Russian military force.
Ukrainian Truth has found imported Ukrainians and their relatives to find out how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The characters of this text have been subjected to voluntary evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and no way out.
Fortunately, they're alive and in touch with their families.
However, in view of the Ukrainian authorities ’ claims, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took the children out of there without their parents, including Miroslav, aged 12, the daughter of the dead Ukrainian champion of Joseph Zachpenski's voyage.
The family of Alexander and Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vala moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was the one who got his job at Antonov Airport, about a mile [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although a civilian.
As true sculptors, Denise and Marina collected their disturbing suitcases ahead of time, but in the morning of February 24th, they didn't have time to evacuate.
They didn't have their car, and they didn't have their bus.
At about 12: 00 a.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with a Latin letter V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down into the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, before the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hiding in their basements.
They didn't all decide.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came to the driveway, talking and not Russian, not Ukrainian.
They say, "Who is?" I say so. "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All the men were questioned as to whether they had served in the army.
The women said, "We have come to defend you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen MOON, not even a military force, young boys aged 25-35.
They said, "We were helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasko Billi (in command of the UnA-UNSO nationalist movement "Wicking," which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Centre War - UP), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that the water was a big problem.
They hacked the store, took the goods from there under the drive of "the Russians" and brought us six.
There's a video on the Internet where kids thank Kadir for food.
So they brought a sausage after they looted the store and said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovic."
No one really wanted to talk, but they did make a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to give back our phones" -- they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said, well, they came because they didn't want wars, Ukrainians support and they're good at all, "Putin's a bastard, Cadov's too, but we can't do anything because there's our families."
And most of the time, they didn't fight, they went shopping, they were marauding.
The chickens were put on their own, one was tied to one leg of the Geological Strip, and the other was their white scotch, and they called it "silver."
They arrived in Ukraine unprepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence works... when they were beaten on Buchi, so they didn't even take the dead, they said, "What, you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had built - up troops – vaccists among themselves did not know each other; on the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or that they were strangers.
We had them until March 13th, followed by the Russian MOON, followed by the Omsant.
They put 30 or 40 units of technique between the houses-- ours fell into it all the time from the Brightars.
But these came and told us that there's no VMS, but there's "Azov," and they said, "Azova" is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
"Keas has already surrendered" has been going on since early March.
One day a Russian officer — or an officer or a representative of the FSB — came to our house and said there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- there was about Buch, Gostomel, thinking maybe we had a green corridor.
From the beginning, we passed our lists on to the Chechens, and they promised to contact Ukrainian command.
But they tell us, "You're being taken to Belarus and then maybe to the Rostens."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
They said, "So pity your children's mentality!"
As it worked, they took us into the basement and started shooting us from under the house – or the Grams, or the mortars.
And then it came back... and neighborly houses were just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct impression on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part didn't leave, saying it was for traitors in the homeland, saying, "You're going to get shot there, the organs are going to be sold."
We were taken across Chernobyl, along both sides of the road were burning, broken down, even though the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the technique right up to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
We've gone through improvised control at the Belarusian Comar point, and many people have been without documents, because they've burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, where we had tea.
And here we hear the shots, the rocket shoots, and you can see that this is lskandar working on Kiev.
Although these people from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, they're planes flying, they're turning around."
But we're aviation, we've got education, we know what it is.
Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Wenger Vasil Stéphaewicz, came and said, "Here, I'm Hohol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until your thieves are killed.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say as he will."
They asked for interviews with Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The Sanatorium Administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN -- at least they were called -- spread disinformation that men were not allowed to go to Poland.
Many believed it and feared leaving Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents, and our daughter had no passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday, war broke out.
The Ukrainian Consulate didn't help us, and at the Minsk station, they said nobody would take a bus without passports.
Let me tell you that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
So we were settled in Minsk, and the escorts were carried out.
The sanatorium wasn't held by force.
Our second group of migration representatives said you could live here for a week or a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozir (about 30 miles [50 km] from Ukraine’s U.S. border), we saw ballistic missiles launch in Ukraine — a rocket that first flew out, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
The people who boarded the bus in Mozira said that the Russians were constantly shooting at the troops.
But I can tell you that the Belarusians don't want to fight.
The generals are getting fired from the army.
One woman told us she'd break something to her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, is not believed at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They are not perceived to be used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going to go through the registration, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, English flags are probably as much now as Estonian."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomela with her brother's family -- his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24th, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the basics and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself couldn't come home and she couldn't do it -- no house.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
Can't you get anywhere in the middle on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And we've always been waiting for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, the moths are beautiful.
And in this little apartment, you don't get Wyphai, mostly all of your questions I answer and now I don't know how to be? And kids on Monday have online activities, and the Internet isn't available.
So I'm going to live with two women from Ukraine and their kids, is this a family ready to accept us?
The Koran says: “Even a leaf from a tree falls from its knowledge.”
We have kids learning online, I'm a salesman and a cook, but I can also work in the fields and a cleaning woman, i.e., a multi-kill Marioner, she can work at home, and Marion's friend has no speciality, that is, he's a different person.
Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, the city’s head, Buchi Anatoly Fedouk, delivered a joyful message – the Ukrainian military on March 31, freed the city from Russian hostages.
The next day the occupiers were thrown out of the entire district of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that time was overshadowed by the horror and hatred that at the same time it became known that at the same time, at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians in Buchi alone.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up, some were shot in the back, some were shot in the back, some were minors.
The chief of Motijin, Olgu Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and his son, Alexander, were found murdered and abducted on March 23.
Olga's and Alexander's bodies were in the brother's grave, Igor's in the sewerage.
On the side of the 20 - mile [20 km] road from Kiev, the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there's no one at home.
I ordered a package from Germany with DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one contacted me and the parcel was delivered, and the DHL said the recipient couldn't be found.
So the mail was sent and the address of this department was given.
How can I take it?
I also, when I was little every day, several times I could be on a river, a river just outside the house is quite close, but now I'm very rarely going, I don't have time, and sometimes I only want to go with my sister.)

Good afternoon, I'm talking to you -- you have to learn Czech, and I can't break free from the news.
I've been talking to you a lot about thinking, and I think you're hearing my thoughts.
President Vladimir of Selenski stated that certain weapons provided by Western partners had arrived too late.
He said that in an interview with the Associated Press, a portion of which was published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment they're sending is too late for some types of equipment.
So when we talk about Mariuples, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," said Greenski.
And the question is, that's enough weapons to get Ukraine to make a difference in the war, and the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have been, or it would have looked different.
"It would open differently, we would have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be any war," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armoured equipment and anti-ship weapons.
I dream about ending the war and going home.
Would you please write me about anything you need?
I wanted to ask you maybe you know how we got a blender in the kitchen.
Destructive actions in the form of fairies and disinformation are designed to provoke panic and disorganization, which are sensitive to public safety.
I'm from Ukraine right now in Plzeni.
Before the war in Ukraine, I've worked for 20 years as a women's designer, as well as child clothes from a variety of materials, and I can also sew on specialized equipment and make WTO.

I hear a lot -- 10 percent of Ukraine's territory is war.
Why do people run away?
Why don't they live in an area where there's no war?
Are you crazy?
Did you live in a fighting state?
When prices went up by 100 to 200%.
When the dysfunctional business doesn't work.
When there's nowhere to make a living.
When do the kids hear the air?
Did you live like that?
You have no idea.
And God forbid them.
If you find out, it'll be terrible.
That's why we're running away.
Some of us are confused, some of us with telephones... that have been left of our other life... yes, some have not adapted in a month.
And you could adapt from 0 per month.
So the state gives us 5,000 kroner.
Would you be able to live on that money?
Many funds provide food.
Have you tried subway rides with the kids to the foundations?
When you look for food in one, another wears clothes, and then you go to the third one, it's not enough time.
And tomorrow we're going back... because the food we've only been given is enough for a day.
You want to support yourself... and the kids where?
How do I live without knowing the language?

I went to the store with my mother and sister.
They came, they prepared food, they talked.
I went out to the yard to breathe fresh air, and I cleaned up a little bit in the yard because I could stay in the house all the time.
If I knew, I'd come with you.
On the map, I looked at them only three miles [3 km] away.
I'd be able to get my feet and drive away from Brno.)) (Laughter)

It's already gone to the crook, but it's not that simple... it's very much crying.
Today, a new girl from Ukraine comes into the garden.
I didn't even touch the door, and she's calling.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I worked in a garden, I could come to work for as many hours as I got.
If so, then I will be able, for example, to work several days a week.
For just how many hours and what days I'll be watching to get out of me to fashion me and cleaning my apartments to walk, there's more cleaning paid so I don't want to give up and give up that job.
I'm water technology, so I feel right about it.
Said inexpensive and delicious cakes.
But, in general, it's okay.
By the way, can I do tests these days?
I might go to dinner on a live air if they let me go home tonight!)
As long as we are 3 (a three - year - old and 17 - year - olds), perhaps a man will later move to our home because he remains in the dormitories.
How many courses do we have, and what level of language can we count on when we get through them?
I'm free on Monday.
And it would be very good for me.
I'll make all the materials.
I have a superbook where the Czech language is step by step.
One moment I'd really like to ask if I could have been 1:00 to 14:00, because I'm working until 12:30.

Thank you very much for your concern.
We Can Meet Often
My husband can bring him home to you tomorrow or Saturday, if that suits you.
I know God is with him.
Okay, then we can go to the area next to the river.
For all of your time if you don't have your family right now means that you haven't come what it means when you have it 10 times bigger and closer than it would have been.

He was a very wealthy man, but he liked me because I had my point of view of life I dated him and then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he telephoned and informed him that he had had heart surgery.
When I asked him to talk to me and support me, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man, and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made a suggestion to me.
"I had a car in my yard that looked like a crocodile, and I had hail.

"I tell her that TV and radio repair has been prolonged by import details, while friends and acquaintances have been warned not to give up when they call."
"All month we hide from our mother-in-law about war.
So far it's been done.
However, on the foot and back feet of the Pygmies, the fur may have been the result of stress, a change in the food supply, and a shortage of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, and here's the stress on me, unfortunately.
Unlike her mother-in-law, she's not deaf, and she hears both sirens and explosions."
Because Olga doesn't hear well and spend most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her incognito.
And April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov took up arms for the first time in his life.
"33 days I lived with her in the apartment, as a partisan.
Wars were hidden from her, and what I was around was formally coming for hours as usual.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver -- she listened for four hours, then sang two hours."
A radio receiver was always outside the bed.
Most of the time the mother - in - law spends in her room.
It sounds bad; it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
For one thing, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
And then I called everyone who's talking to her, and that's six to seven people.
I asked her to talk to me about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th - I'm cleaning 2 apartments:)
Good evening, I didn't think about it.
Hey, if we need our help tomorrow, we can come.

I understand and don't complain, but in my situation I'll be looking here.
I'm telling you, the embassy is just here,
The British who defended Mariupoli in the VMS ranks says they're ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British military officer of the Ukrainian Marines Army, who participates in the defense of Mariupoli, told his friends and family that they would take up arms and surrender to Russian occupations.
Source: Eislain's twitter page, British who's been serving in the LMS since 2018, Air Force, referring to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News, with reference to Aislasin's friend's words, who talked to him.
It's like, "We got a message from him, 48 days later, we tried everything we could to protect Mariopol, but we don't have a choice but to commit ourselves to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammo left.
Thank you, everyone, I hope that the war will end soon."
Eislin was serving in the 36th separate Marine Marines Unit of the AAA, which is involved in Mariupoli's defence operation.
Air Force reporters contacted Ann Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son had informed her on the phone that they were planning to be captured.
A military friend, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last telephone conversation, Icelin had spoken about their capitulation unit plans.
He said that the brigade had run out of ammo and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted a friend of his who said that Aislasina's unit was intent on surrendering to the Russian divisions in order not to go without weapons and bullets to the hands of the so-called "Cadiles".
The social media also distributed audio recordings of a telephone conversation that Aislin spoke to her familiar American friend who was planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British told him earlier that in Instagram he had been threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark en Trent in Nottingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the U.S.S.A. and took an oath.
Aeslaina's friends and friends were called Johnny, and on social media, he's more famous than anyone else's Cossack Gundi.

I am not afraid of my work, as I lived in a village too, so I can and enjoy working physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition. We're going this way to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved a draft law of 7176, entitled “What to do with monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere”.
It is surprising that, in fact, Ukraine's only potential threat to national security in the economic sphere has proved to be... the place where members of the supervisory council meet.
Initiators believe that decision-making by the supervisory board in conditional Kiev can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know of a lot of new threats to the companies, but as long as we don't know any company that needs to physically meet the surveillance board at the location.
The potential threat of such a law has come to light is an excellent basis for putting into practice all the gains made in the difficult reform of enterprises following the Hygiene Revolution, including independent oversight boards, and for establishing manual management.
That's what it was until 2015.
Why are the supervisory boards in charge, and who should join them?
What's more, if under patriotic slogans one harmful piece of legislation flies, then tomorrow, others can fly off — for example, the ProZorro public procurement system or the NSA independence.
A lot can be written down to war.
By the way, this initiative came before the war and the law of 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of law in 5397.
In general, the desire to sever oversight boards in one way or another has long been felt among some people’s electors.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to demonstrate the possible effects of the legislation, let us examine the arguments that explain the need for its adoption.
And then let's give you some suggestions on how to deal with the management of entrepreneurship during the war.
Denise Cudin's first deputy economic minister explained the need for such a innovation at the risk of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for remote surveillance services.
In other words, the risk is that the board of directors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may mean that the company's work is paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will he be able to prevent members from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation in which independent members of the supervisory board (most of the composition) put their personal security ahead of the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, they could be released by law.
And then, most likely, it will result in the loss of the quorum needed by the supervisory council to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory council quickly, since the law provides for a competitive selection, which averages three to four months.
Thus, the 7176 decision proposed by the law would not necessarily prevent the oversight board from losing its ability to make decisions, but rather would result in it!
The national deputy, author of the law, Dmitro Natale, gives other reasons for his support.
In particular, he says, "Many enterprises, such as the Defense and Industrial complex (OPC), now need to be resuscitated," and "it's hard to imagine that a person can talk about addresses and other sensational information from Vienna."
To begin with, Ukraine has little or no PKK enterprises with oversight boards.
The board of oversight is except in Ukroborprom, which essentially manages almost all of the PKK's businesses.
But even in Ukroborprom, according to legislation, the supervisory council has very limited powers, and all its members do not perform duties without payment.
The full power of Ukroboromir belongs to the Director-General, who by the way will decide on the need to relocate a particular CDC enterprise that is part of the competitor.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand up to criticism because there is no legislative change at all in the legislation governing the activities of PKK enterprises.
Mr. Dmitre on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments generally have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the company and the bankers, but let's try to figure out some of them: "Regardless alien experts in the first word "war" leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of the executive board in Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself actually suffers from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these members of the supervisory council never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally came here.
So it's fair to say that they're leaving Ukraine, to say that it's unfair.
Second, as a result of the coroner's pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long used online meetings.
This instrument is a long - standing tool in world practice, with a wide variety of fields — business, education, medicine, and so forth.
And don't forget, membership of the board is not a full-time job.
These people tend to have other jobs, and they're actually getting e-mails to help them do that.
Third, all these claims are read as claims solely for foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitre not make identical claims to members of the Ukrainian supervisory board?
Because they're not at the place where they find their companies.
In fact, this is not the first populistic attempt by deputies to remove aliens from supervisory boards, and war is just a new opportunity.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults.
In Brovarski, Vishrodsky, and Buchan district of Kiev, who were released from the occupations, an increased curfew will be imposed for two days.
Pavluka's direct language is: "In the populated areas of Brovarsky, Vishrodsky and Buchansky districts under Russian occupation and released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the curfew has been increased!
These cities and villages will have restrictions from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the area, at this time it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of localities and other public places, travel and walk.
Residents can only walk out of the street when alarmed to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression — to clear and decompose territories.
Omelenuk called on people who had left these areas to stay away from returning home.
In the rest of Kiev, the curfew will last every day from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

After full-scale aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries have taken seriously the predictions of a possible increase in the Balkans.

The Lukashenko regime has detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, who have been involved in the destruction of two jet lockers of a signaling machine under Osišević, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Source: Radio Swanda, Vyasna Law Protection Centre, MIF Chief Gennad Kazakević Criminal Police, quoted by Belta State Information Agency.
At MIF Belarus, it was reported that on March 30th, the three people of Bobruiska were arrested for their strong support of SGI agents, and one was injured.
According to the Science report, men were actively opposed and tried to escape during the delay.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and detained in a medical facility.
Others were given medical treatment locally.
The Head of the Criminal Police at MAF, Belarus, Hennadi Kazakewicz, stated that "terrorist activities on the RB railways will be severely stopped" by the armed forces.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30th, the police arrested another member of the Belarusian Railway, another member of the Baranowitz Section of the BJD and the management of the BWC thematic resources at the WKontaktié and the One-Salemons.
Where it is currently and in what state it is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
By the end of March, at least 40 railway men were detained in Belarus for their diversion.
We're reminded that the BYpol regime announced by Lukashenko's extremist regime continues to call on the Belarusians to carry out diversions on railway and Belarus's infrastructure as part of the Peramgo Plan.
The Belarusian "Jewish guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that through Belarus, the Russian Federation is being transferred to war, with power and technology living in Ukraine.

U.S. bans investments in the Russian Federation and sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, along with G7 and EU, has imposed new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and has banned all new investments in Russia.
That's what we're talking about on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution in government, and Alpha Bank is Russia's largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will impose a total ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Bayden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on a decision of over 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
Private sector output includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms," referred to in the White House statement.
The third step in the new U.S. sanctions was to restrict large Russian public enterprises in the critical sphere.
It'll ban U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of Minfine will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete freezing of assets of adult children of Putin, wives and daughters of the foreign minister of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, and Prime Minister Michael Misustin.
Sanctions shut them down from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

You can call school, Kira doesn't pick up the phone, don't answer, don't know if she's gone to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop investment and stop supply.
But we didn't understand.
There were no military accommodations in our home.
Our home is near the military station and the oil station.
He was just helping me because I wouldn't do it myself.
Tastely preparing, not asking too much, and giving good advice
I'm giving my own advice.
I'm a little hard, but I know I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you on Thursday and tell you everything.
It's all right.
Goul, how often do you clean up?
I clean every week.
I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I wanted to be a teacher.
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner.
I'd like to ask you that if you hear information about housing, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with some decent girl.
If you can know him, let him know.
I'm not going to let it go.
Thank you very much.
I didn't write you another Nathal 54-year-old man. Please write an exact address and how many courses are worth.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, and they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name, I've had it since I was born:)
Hello, Mr. Reyard, I'm sorry I didn't see it, and I'm going to do it and I'm going to send it to you right away.
We're going to the medical department right now.
I mean, I don't need to work this hour another day.
On what day is it better for her to arrive early? (Maybe a day of a little more work?)
I'll hear tomorrow, the Internet works badly.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... some of the things we found out, but there was nothing in technology...
Both startups, except the alphabet, know nothing.
Nothing happens.
May I have a Monday 25.04?
Children can be taken along, toys are enough:)
I've known my dad.
I guess I'm very naive or very in love, but I'll figure out something with that money.
We'll do it one day.
But how will it be paid, please, no loans.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You got to take the clothes you gave me?
It's not my day. It's been my day to break the blinds in the living room. One morning.
Something came from you, I can't see
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you about the invoice later on.
Do you have only your dad speaking and understanding Russian?
What day does a colleague want to clean up a house, and how many windows does he have?
I'm ashamed I'm distracting you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you, there's a message from Mariopolis for son alive and in power.
I advise you to read Joe Dispensation, he's doing scientific research on external influences and the formation of new connections neurons.
The 1+1 television journalist Natalia Nagara released in the morning of April 12th, a video that was broadcast to the 36th Marine Corps of Mariupoli.
There the military say that they have no weapons left to participate in the fighting, nor in the mountain of the wounded.
They said it's going to go for an hour.
Before that, on April 11, 36th, a separate Marine Corps, which participates in the defense of Mariupoli, published a statement to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement was that April 11th could be the last fight for Mariupoli's supporters, and Ukrainian military command wasn't connected to the fighters for two weeks.
The social media were told that the application had been published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valery Zalujna, assured us that there is a link between command and defence forces in Mariupola, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian combatants in the Aztal plant in Mariopol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian Ocupunctures dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariuples.
Andrey Blithesky's leader reported that the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Aztal plant, which holds the regiment's forces.
Thank you, I'll adapt to you.
The situation is the same for the time being.
Two hours ’ drive ) walk, shop mom, and back!
It's not important.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech drone squadron has since begun flying over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional Coptics will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy, directly, an enemy invader.
Two Carpathians and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine by the day before yesterday, thanks to Mr. Vladimir Labutenka, deputy of the Mukakev City Council.
Today, their inter-hungry friends, led by a village council leader and coordinator, https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasil Schur, have delivered drones for assignment: they have received special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is taking place.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of the copters -- where they are located, we'll keep them secret.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army do not plan to stop, say that the next few days, many more interesting gifts will be sent to Ukraine to help destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, I love sweet, but I can do it without him.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon. I'm going to work.
If it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try myself, but if I get stuck, I'll write to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old age lady in the village of Yves, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no housing
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll feel better.
I had a phone repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing out on the street today.
I drink drugs and tea, and I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, throw me the music you like.
I'm curious about how much music you have.
Mother and Dad Must Obey
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It was colder and raining today, it must be warm tomorrow.
But not sorry for the destroyed houses, the harm to the people who are being abused by the occult.
In Kherson, the Ocupunctures came from the Memorial of "Glory of Ukraine" in Kherson on the street of Perecopaska.
Details: The unknown people are said to have removed the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photographs of the Celestial Hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukraine War.
The Ocupunctures have torn down the portraits of the heavenly hundreds heroes and the dead participants in the Russian-Ukraine war.
The flag was lifted.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the carol, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given.
There's someone to talk to, if there's anything.
Because I live like a dorm. Until twelve here will be people and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was already in the crèches today.
Even today I've been sleeping there.
As a result, we have made great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring some cooks another time!
I don't have the strength to do them anymore.
Since I push away from the days and times in which there is work to clean up apartments after guests, I can say about April of the month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
By May of the month, I'll be able to say about it at the end of April or early May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't had a long time to prepare dinner and had a little sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet again after you arrive)
He's a modest, he's been learning a lot lately.
Hey, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
Today I have had a lesson from a lady who is the director of a department of economics in the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The skin of the manger was good.
On Monday, I have to offer confirmation of work and cash payment for the crèche.
I'm throwing away from Friday.
I do nothing but much to them and sleep ? (And I drink much water )
If tomorrow comes to the doctor, I'll go with you if you can.
I have another test.
You don't have to go again.
It's really bad working with the run-off can, it's not working well, it's a good job, it's a good job to fix it.
That's enough.
Can you send me the correct e-mail?
I'd like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you signed up for.
And do kids feed there, or do they have to bring them with them?
Now, for a moment, there's one question to ask you.
If There Is Still a Need for Help, Write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, aren't you?
We didn't really want you to raise money from the beginning, so people wouldn't think we were making it up!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough of two things:
I'll go to rest, get some strength and energy, thank you for your present present present.
This is going to be good because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Carazine calls on workers and students to check carefully any information, not to trust anonymous sources in mengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Use only official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I've got a couple of papers for the portfolio.
They're supposed to do the Internet after the holidays.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do I get to count the day I wasn't at work is a pass?
Building headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against neighboring state”.
Word is: "It is not excluded by the armed forces of the Russian Federation of Reprovoking Action in the Transnistrian Region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobojan direction.
Perhaps the next few days, they will try to restore the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons, and equipment to participate in combat operations throughout Ukraine.
Training is under way for weapons and military equipment at the permanent location of the 60th stand-alone Motorist Brigade (Monastistria) of the 5th Common Military Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied area of Donetsk.
Also, in order to repair the loss of the individual unit of the Battalion tactical unit of the 36th individual Mothorc brigade (Borza, Zabaykali Krai), 29 general military armies of the Eastern Military District are recruiting military personnel from the specified brigade.
A particular problem is that the enemy feels when he sets up drivers and driving mechanics.
The removal of the selected individual stock from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Likely, the opponent, in order to disrupt the delivery of cargo to combat sites, will continue to strike over transportation infrastructures in Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disrupting them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belorian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobogian direction, separate units of the 6th General Military Army and the Northern Navy coast forces continue to partially block the city of Kharkov, and they carry artillery shelling of individual areas of the city.
In the Izüm direction, an air survey is under way to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
To that end, the opponent uses Orlan-10 BPL.
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack the population of Longnak and Dimitrovka, which had failed to succeed and had taken up a previously occupied position.
On Donetsk’s track, the opponent continues to focus his efforts on the control of the Papas, Rubie, Lower, and Novobachmuk, as well as on the establishment of full control over the city of Mariopol.
The enemy tried to storm in the Golden Region, and he didn't succeed.
In the city of Mariopol, through artillery and aviation, the Ocupants continue to storm in the areas of Aztal plant and seaport.
The enemy used separate units to carry out artillery shelling of Ukrainian troops in areas inhabited by Visopopilla, Labour and Mariana.
In Donetskoy and Lugansk district, Ukraine's supporters have beaten four enemy attacks in the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armoured units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't you understand your thoughts?
We're sure we're gonna try to make it, but I doubt it.
And if you want to sleep, I'll hold you back.
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you don't want to see me tonight, so tell me I'll understand.
We didn't watch TV at home, and much more than 1+1.
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to Czech.
I'm running out of a month's tariff bag today:)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for sewn, canvas, thread for stitching
I understand I can prepare material in this area.
I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's giving us so many pies.
I'll see my father later, I'm sure.
I read an ad on Facebook, maybe Google wrote something in his own way, I think the phone number's enough.
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but are there things you can bring to us that little in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director is OK, I can start work the next week, because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the office to deliver the documents (if you can, because there's a lot of queues) and Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, and I'm very interested in chemistry at school, and I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, and I'm thinking of working on Tevi.
Friends of old and not very much, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too are faced with difficult times.
During the past month, I've been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has been turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is given your name.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Chercasov, my very old friend from "Memorial."
I'll tell you a little later – as usual, Sasha answered in a concise way. – Now we're going through ruins after the search.
Others — cultural actors, artists, critics, writers — are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you -- those who worked in the Mermorial, the New newspaper, the Echo Moscow, the Medes, the Naveny organization, and a bunch of other places -- how many of you have done anything to resist this regime?
Except participating in meetings while they were still taking place.
Read also a column of Russian journalist "To be late to hide, to be quiet."
And if so, you're sure your sense of shame and guilt isn't just abstraction?
Maybe they're caused by your long-term indifference to what's going on around you, your apathy and your passive compassion, which now must have been a heavy burden on your soul and heart.
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s there was a short period of time when you had some freedom and democracy – a messy one even bloody but real one.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why do every time you finally have a revolution, you end up being so afraid of sadness that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer next to him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of captureing and publishing the KGB archives, as did the Germans of Stasi, you took a soul on the monument of Drzhinski – and allowed the KGB to lay low, update, transform and seize power over the country.
When you were presented with a choice between the theft of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998 your economy fell, marking the end of mass gatherings for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
Then Putin came along, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to take out terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started to compare Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember well those years.
I was then working in Chechnya to help victims of the Putin anti-terrorism operation, and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar Jurty, Itum Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the tortures of civilians, the deaths of children, the soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You told me, "Damn, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I said, "You guys, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices, and Putin's willingness to condone the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the middle-class pockets.
Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and found a better job.
Prices went up, didn't they?
The Moscow festival shone brightly and glistened from its neck.
When a number of oppositioners were killed — Yuri Szczekochina, Anna Politowski, Alexander Litwinka and others — many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was going on.
However, the matter was not going on.
When, after two terms Putin passed on President Medvedev's office, and you yourself took the prime minister, I see you barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's reign, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or talked.
How many of you have met in the years that followed on the mountain slopes of Gudavoury, in the foothills of Kazbezi or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, it's unlikely that we in the West did a lot if we did something at all.
A little resentment, some sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when the great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you Russian friends woke up.
When Putin again traded seats with Medvedev and sat down with the president's chair as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you came out massively to protest.
The name Navali became nicknamed, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck back.
At first alternative actions were organized, and then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some have received enormous terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often, and I can still hear it.
"The government is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Dissented by the pro - Russian president, who had deceived their European expectations, they once captured Meidane — and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves by using their sticks, handguns, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went into an attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive became Yanukovich, and the Ukrainians restored democracy, the right to choose their own leaders, and expel them if they do wrong.
The Mayan didn't like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
So he took advantage of the general confusion and captured Crimea.
Some of you opposed, but the benefits were few.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his chess suddenly returned 180 degrees Fahrenheit [180 ° C] and began to idolize it.
I find it difficult to find a reason, since immediately after that, we stopped associating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding new ones in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new ones since the restoration that Moscow started in 2012 -- with their beebeaks, popular waifs and hipster coffees.
Yes, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, wasn't there?
IDILE or something... even a Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, then criticized it in interview because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there and saw myself on the streets of Homs, State snipers shooting cold blood at my children's peers.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who, in 2015, began to bomb thousands of civilians, learning of the experience of the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeler:
"In the first place, they came for socialists, but I said I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I said I'm not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I said I'm not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some people are really talking right now -- like Dmitro Glukovsky, Mikhail Shiškin, Mikhail Ziegar, Maxim Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Osolinikov, risking entry into a new GULAG or making up a company called Nvalnikov.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians -- or that seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who were brave but who were mostly alone in protesting, they still had a very small term, but soon they'll get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed disagreement on social networks (whether only a black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
When 10 years or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were given simply for anecdots, they were left in a less distant past -- and now they are, with great probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you?
The Ukrainian example – even more than 2014 – is frightening to the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that mind, motivation, and bravery can stop it, no matter how oppressive it is on the paper of its advantage.
In view of all of this, few people in Russia realize that this is true, as is the fact that war is ongoing at all.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You're reading long news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine you're in contact with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence ended.
Your election is just a hahma, your laws, if you don't take into account repressives, are worth no more than the paper on which they're written, your last free media is gone, your economy is going to go down faster than I am writing, you don't have credit cards anymore to buy a plane overseas, even if there's any flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go or you'll get crushed.
I doubt you're seeing another option.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe under the circumstances that you're made up of, you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not going to explode from you: because of the economic collapse coming up on Russia, it's most likely to light up in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages don't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out.
Putin knows this and fears these people a lot more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, i.e. you my friends.
But if every city goes into meetings on its own, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination are required. A crowd will need to be converted into mass.
You have this great magic tool -- the Internet, which can limit, but it still works, and it can be set up in almost any circumstance.
The Napoléon organization has been broken down, but other more informal ones can be created, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If there's more than 300,000, it's going to be shocked.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, what did he make them in Ukraine, everything that made them go through?
Of course, danger will be great.
Many of you will have a clear fear: but those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
In Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their host who dare not only demand freedom but really try to gain freedom.
But even if you do nothing, countless lives will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke into a chat room of a computer game – and be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a raw cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years – and it will continue to grow as we grow larger and larger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Act in a cold - blooded manner, think in a strategic way, and make it a reality.
We were at class on Friday, they told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home by evening.
That you view me as a press secretary
age, how often do you go to dinner at an expensive restaurant?
Once on a stream, I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her.)
So we liked it very well and we wanted something better, so that's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people, and I got tired of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice, weakness and head revolve
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done it, but we've told you who's registered in April cash only at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, we're going with the kids to the doctor.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your job, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for her with new news and I'm sure I'll report it.
As I worked in the Public Prosecutor's Office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
I'm sorry for my time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I take marriage issues seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think people have to love, respect, trust each other to make a family.
I haven't met that at the moment.
Good afternoon, where can you buy shapes in Jehoihar to bake a pike or a silica?
Well, thank you for your advice, I'll now put a witness on Valya's file.
She's got a child in a lying state, she's got a leg broken in a plaster, a wheelchair in a lying position, food is all digested in a blender.
Mr. Reyhard, I'm sorry to bother you at no time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into a game room today in Natalie's room to say hello to her.
She had a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she was coming to watch things and put them in that clothing room and Mr. Valery opened our children's room to her until 7:00.
Can this really be the case?
Working hours of the room until 4:00.
And ultimately, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load. I don't have a very weak Internet page.
Hey, we're all good. Coke's working, we're filling out last night, and I've been working with the seniors before the gym class exam.
It's hard to figure out how to dress in geometry.
On Saturday Vladimir helped us.
Vica studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Thank You very much for Our Housing
Yeah, but I thought you weren't full.
We're going to try to get as much money as possible by the end of the week to calculate.
The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing by President Alexis Aretovic, Adviser to the Chief of Office (10.04.2022)
The president's adviser to Chief Office told of the heroic act of a senior border officer in Mariupoli -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with the radio station, so she didn't get to the enemy.
I've got a very important question about whether I'm going to be able to count my grandson for her five years. (Armoured Astma)
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
A doctor’s counseling is urgently needed because of her condition....
We live in the Czechs, Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor who's here in Dolní Chubry or somewhere next door maybe Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibit was a delight.
The butterflies were sitting on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
I'm so grateful, I don't have words, thank you very much.
Mom's standing there from 4 a.m.
Perhaps the housewife will leave her phone to communicate.
So far, I think the best option is this building in Prague eight.
The director didn't tell me about the possibility of a sponsor's payment for a baby's dinner.
They gave me that information for payment.
