Tom's smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Show him a mistake and he'll thank you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything there.
Make your point clear.
They don't know us.

After lunch, she always has time.
The ground covers a smaller part of the earth’s surface.

Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.

I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.

What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.

I'm DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was there enough money?

It's too expensive.
A lost child.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
They stole my wallet.
He knows a lot of people.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Tell me.
The surface of the balloon is noneuclidic, so it does not follow the rules of euclid geometry.

Be honest and direct.
Hope is always there.

Your doctor says you're gonna be okay.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My tie's orange.
Is Tom still crying?
So I'd love to be taller.
I have to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
It's not my ideas.
You got a plan, right?
He's out.
Tom's not in town.
I was wearing shoes.
Next year's going to be worse.
Mary's wearing a yellow dress.
Love has bitter tastes.
The meeting was over.
You should have done this last year.

We understand why.
I drive every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.

Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this account in a book.
Tom still got a bicycle?
Talk briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She's spending too much time on the Internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom goes in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.

Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for dinner today?
You can't even swap a paper.
Are people still using Web cameras?
I wonder if Tom used to ask Mary why she left school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.

Don't push.
The car's out there.
I was weak.

Who's left?
When's she coming?
It's not my style.
Try and focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Is Tom still living next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd love Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years ago.
Tom's probably gonna do it.
It has to be the right color.

What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?

I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.

I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
Sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom's never been to Australia?
I understand now.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and there was Grand Pri.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my own language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's that girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we should not do this again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom was staring at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she's gone.

I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sledge.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, born the same year as I, and she's getting ready for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you finish your homework?
Monday must be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.

Can you help me?
Asshole.

Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.

Where's Daddy?
Lock the door.
I won't speak French to Tom.
The apple does not fall far from the apple tree.
Be realistic.

They're not coming back.
I was wearing jeans.
I'll see you after the play.
I'd like to ask you a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satan’s Church.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you for ages.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are these?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks out the dogs twice a day.
Let me look at this book of Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sykoku, Honsu, and Kyushu.

I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
I'll split it up.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've set up our office with computers.
We have to pay early.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Don't you plan on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Do you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I wear boots.
You can count on me.
His book became subject to criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
That's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You haven't lost your time.
Who knows when Tom will do this?
Tom witnessed in Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask you what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Can you give me some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular for both students and teachers.
You can't help with tears.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
Tom calls you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking on the esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' steward.
I'll handle this.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let Tom lock you up?
You're a good woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom pulled Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?

Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.

I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.

Tom still wants to come.
You can't run.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you go on vacation?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I still miss my home a little bit, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have some memory problems sometimes.
Where's Mom?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
You know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi here?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Is Tom always acting like that?
I like golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She abandoned it.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So I felt sorry for Mary.
Right now, I'm watching the news.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, but Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone but me is late.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on shaking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
You were at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good morning.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She ignores me completely.
Tom goes to a party tonight.
I told you.
She was on her way to the airport.

Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We're going on foot.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell 'cause I was kidding?
That's why it was terribly boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get the trash out.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister's always great.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed from fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How awful!

I was wearing a white dress.
Check again.

Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
They're worthless now.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do that than it seemed.
Her friends made fun of her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom might win.

That's why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do that than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago I was very rich.
It's not hard to do that.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but I'm taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It matters to me.
The box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to begin?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.

We're not a couple.
You want a student to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why aren't you asleep?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
You don't need a hand!
Tom, you might say it's nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like it?
The problem is, solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.

You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?

Be good to a cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?

Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your work.
Are you working next door?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm sloppy.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to understanding.
I'm sharing everything.
The choices are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Don't you buy it?
Women are beautiful.
Would it not be wonderful if Tom did?
Did you do it?
I'm having trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes irritates me.
I'm pretty good at dancing.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.

Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your sufferings make me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Do Tom and Mary know?
You all right?
Don't sleep with the lights on.
He's not stupider than you.
Trains in Serbia are very slow.
I think Tom's broken.
"Coni" is the set of the words "xen."
Where's the ashtray?
Can you explain what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.

It was part of the plan.

I think Yumi's sick.

Are you hurt?

I was polite.
Whose glass is it?
I heard every word.
Tell me about your school.

Tom went downtown.
The main social problem in the country is poverty.
Can you lend me your bike?
They're from Greece.

I'm a mechanics.
Let's say hello to him.
Mary is Tom's wife.

What you say is true.
He's got a deep voice.

This rose is beautiful.
The Russian alphabet is not that difficult for me.

I'm sorry I did this.
There's not enough food.
I assumed that Tom was Mary’s boyfriend.
My car doesn't start.
I'll leave if you leave.

It's not about the price.
If anything can go wrong, it'll happen.
You better not wait here.
We were able to understand each other.
I didn't sleep when you gave me the phone.
My car's in repair.
What are you doing tonight?
They called themselves at six o’clock in the evening.
It wasn't my suitcase.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she didn't have to do this.
It's a bottle.
These new cars are put on sale.
It's time to tell you the truth.
Football is my favorite sport.

If I had time, I'd have visited Tom.
Are you alone?
Leave him alone.
Can this happen?
Didn't you do your homework?
Mary, of course, is attractive.
I'm sorry, he's not here.
I often go to movies.
Is that too complicated?
I woke up too late.
I don't know if it's good or not.

He whispered something to her.
She came home very late.
I saw him on the stairs.
I really hope so.
I love potatoes.

Who are our closest relatives among the animals?

At breakfast Tom likes to eat uncooked eggs.
We can't count on Tom doing that.
We'll take your proposal into account.

Tom doesn't live long here.
I was very upset.
Our policy is to satisfy our customers.
Don't tell me.
Tom can still die.
I don't understand it at all.
I'm still busy.

There's too many of them!
I was on the beach last weekend.
Mary is very shy.
Are these your sunglasses?
I don't understand you sometimes.

Prove it.
We went to the same church.
I wonder if Tom saw this movie.
I'll kill you.
If you mix three original colors, you get black.
Is he breathing?
The speed I can work with has limits.
Tom does more than I do.
Do you often miss dinner?
Yes, we promise.
I'm sorry about the mistake.
Unfortunately, no, on the contrary.
Don't you feel sad?
Jump on the creature to kill him.
You have to go.
I think I'm gonna love it here.
You need help, Tom.
Tom often lied to Mary.
Tom's the only one who can help you with that.
Why don't you take a umbrella with you just in case?
His grandfather is still very healthy for his age.

He's learning right now.
I don't think it's art.
I don't want to be rude with them.
I was trying to tell you.
You said that an hour ago.
Why didn't you tell him that you can't do it without his help?
I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!
Maybe I was wrong.
Tom and Mary had already returned from Australia.
Do you understand French?
I bought it that week.
It's obvious that Tom doesn't speak to Mary.
I have to leave tomorrow morning.
I knew we could find you.
Mary likes girls.
Do you have anything else?
I think you're lying.
I can't answer your question.
Tom said he was interested.
I often eat bananas.
Mary was looking for her pen.
Who's your favorite athlete?
The temperature is going down.

How much can I keep this book?
You know very well what she wants.
It's a cell phone.
They have achieved their goal.

Six plus four is equal to ten.
I can't swim well.
God will forgive you.
I left the dictionary downstairs.
Tom loves pizza and fries.
I already decided not to do so.
You broke your leg.
It's January two today.
How many times do we do that?
Is that your money?
Tom was a brave soldier.
Nothing's gonna happen to Tom.
Tom really loves you.
I was very happy to receive a letter from Tom.
We work every day except Monday.
Is that really spaghetti?
Are you angry with Tom?
She asked him to turn off the light on the exit.
You can't rush.
What's the boy's name?
I always stand at half by eight.
Did I invite you?
That's what Tom eventually did.
I'm tired of playing.
Are you French or English?
He turned the horn.
Just keep on doing what you're doing.
You made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are some exceptions.
Did Tom say when he came?
What kind of animal is a small one?
I knew how it would end.
I doubt Tom really meant what he said.
I said I'd try.
Tom took care of his sick father.
I'll do whatever I want.
I called Tom's parents.
Tell 'cause I'm exhausted.
I thought Tom wouldn't do that.
How much money do you want?
Tom's changed.
I do not enjoy traveling in large groups.
Tom doesn't regret anything.
I'm sorry, please.
What's in your backpack?
We have evidence this time.
My throat hurts.
I like to finish what I'm starting to do.
We have to do it more often.
Hey, how are you?
I won't eat that.
We hoped that the rain would stop by lunchtime.
It's raining tomorrow.
I've been in a coma for three months.
Tom wants to kill you, Mary.
My sister doesn't do anything right now.
I've already read the book you lent me.
Mark has more money than you do.
I don't have to tell you what it is, do I?
Just listen to us.
Good luck.
I'm better.
I was amazed at how Tom did it.
Tom speaks French as well.
Aren't you ready to help us?
I have doubts that the new proposal will be accepted.
Release her.
How far away are we from Boston?
Here's what we've been thinking about.
We do not desire the One who is wicked.
Can I try?
I hate dancing.
He can play the flute.
Some animals do not reproduce when they are held in cages.
Tom locked the door.
Did Tom sleep?
His father was a carpenter.
Someone smart, somebody's not.
Tom went back to the mall.
They're gonna kill us all.
Why did Tom go to the hospital?
Do you know any cheap hotel around here?
Eat cake.
Two times two to four.
There's nothing you can do without trying.
You want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He retired at the age of 65.
I lost my pen.
I'll keep working.
I was at the meeting yesterday.
Leila's late.
I wonder if Tom used to ask Mary why she did.
I'll be in Boston for a few days.
I've already done it.
I stayed after school to help clean up the classroom.
Everyone wants something.
Tom's got green eyes?
I always forget people's names.
Why are you asking me?
I'm just looking.
Tom said he didn't care if he won or not.
You speak French well?
You don't really have to do this.
I think Tom's living in Boston right now.
I was scared.
I can read English.
Tom helped me wash my car.
This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I take care of my grandfather.
I'm going to go around ten in the morning.
Did you come by train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He slowly recovers from sickness.
In Rome, act like the Romans.
He saw an expression of surprise in my face.
Hurry up and you'll be on the train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom will actually do that.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell a car.
I just want to measure it.
Tom's car was confiscated.
Could you open the window?
I wonder if Tom is scared.
How well do you know Tom?
You can go.
I got Tom's keys.
Let us in.
I'd like more butter.
It's obvious that Tom likes to be here in Boston.
Tom turned off the music.
The guy I love doesn't love me.
You're very busy.
I'm done for today.
I signed the check.
She gave me a shirt.
Mary trusts me.
Tom returns from Australia next week.
We had a good time yesterday.
Leila saw dreams in Arabic, thought Arabic, spoke Arabic, and cried Arabic.
That day will come!
What color does Tom have in his eyes?
Tom's swimming well.
You're one of us.
It's nice of you to help me.
Choose an event that you remember well.
What do you have?
Tom has a good alibi.
I'm cooking.
He stole it.
I don't think Tom wanted to do it himself.
Hello!
Buy me a bicycle.
A party full of heat.
Tom's not helping me.
Do you agree with us?
Entomology is more than just a study of how flies fly!
Tom didn't want to read the book.
I'll be outside.
If you come here again, I'll call the police.
I know it's gonna be hard.
You got permission to park here?
Everyone can do it.
I'm so tired.
It's time for us to go.
Henry wants to see you.

I don't want to boast, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I have a minute?
Tom may not even get to the team.
I ask myself if I can trust him.
What did she find?
You drink?
I was furious.
When did he arrive?
Where's your stuffed bear?
How you doing, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win Europe.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats are catching mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
That's Tom's signature.
What actually happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Do I make myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom must have been punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first I didn't believe him.
The phone doesn't work at the moment.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom can fine if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really silly.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary he saw John in January.
You're always getting up early, aren't you?
She's always against herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth went from father to son.
No roses without spikes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, ok?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do this?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left his family.
Shall we go?
Don't contact Tom.
I'm out of here.
I'm the boss.
Tom had a good time.
You have to go home before 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Each student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm concerned about something that can be sued.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
I lost my hand.
Tom speaks French well.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
Party's over.
The unicorn has one wheel.
"Dad, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botan.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Tom.
The meetings went pretty well.
At this time of year, the wind is blowing from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and beat this hooligan.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings canter music better than anyone else I know.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them tonight.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she was not sick.
If you want to.
We have suppliers.
My point is that this is a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's substantial.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
Tom's got her.
Tom was barefoot.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to do it.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You can't pay for the trouble.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Come on, I'll talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
You can't buy love.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What is this theater?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said that Tom told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited Grandma.
I hate wedding.
I heard the front door huddled.
I don't have time for you.
Mary is a great dancer.
My grandfather's from Osaka.
I want massage, I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you manage to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think when Tom is here?
Is it snowing tonight?
Does that bother you?
Are you seeing someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know it would happen?
Bad thoughts give birth to bad actions.
Did you bring the fen?
Tom is right.
Do you have any handouts from that bill?
Tom seems a bit ashamed.
We can't do without water.
I can't get my thoughts together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste any time on it.
Encourage me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom claims he's satisfied.
How are you feeling right now?
How many guys are in your class?
These are big apples.
Select a gift carefully.
I'm coming with her.
Why would you do something similar?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I gave up.
The book lacked several pages.
I picked up the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know, Jamal and Sara don't get along too well.
Every student has his own match.
I spent twelve hours in the train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned how to eat a cow.
I'm tired.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
She was very upset by the news.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
How is your name pronounced?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's over nine hundred.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I get your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way of resting.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything about what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard that Mary had married.
I learned a lot.
How much does this umbrella cost?
They both laughed.
What happened?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Did Tom suffer?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please stay here and wait.
I love this shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom must still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Ignore her fancies.
I'm glad Tom's gonna help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't know anything.
I invited her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of Tom's business?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do so.
I don't expect them to win.
I slept.
How is it my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try looking at it from Tom's point of view.
The window's open.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom was pretty sick when I last saw him.
Is Tom still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do this with you.
Mary was watching a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom sat down.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've met Tom several times.
Are you using a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took off his ring.
I'll make you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a little out of date.
