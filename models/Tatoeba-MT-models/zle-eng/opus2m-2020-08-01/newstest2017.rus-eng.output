A 28-year-old cook found dead in the San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairs of a local shopping centre this week.
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine someone who wants to hurt him, saying, "At the end of the day, things were going on his way."
- The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galisia, reported to the San Francisco Forensic Bureau.
The Department of Police of San Francisco reports that death has been classified as murder and investigation continues.
The victim's brother, Luis Galisia, told the KGO TV station ABC in San Francisco that Frank, who had been served by the Boston distribution line, had won his job as a cook at the San Francisco's Sons & Daghters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daghters said they were "sucked and oppressed" by his death.
"We're a little team that works like a friendly family and will miss it very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galisia said Frank stopped at the hostels first, but recently, "He's got business at the end."
"He found an apartment, he met a girl," Louis Galisia said to the GEO.
Luis Galisia said he couldn't imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to make us something to eat, to make us dinner,” said Luis Galisia.
He never wanted to be confused about anything.
He was a brother who was swimming.
"With all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the unbounded diamond that was shining brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who owns the information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at number 415-575-4444.
Churkin said the UN's meeting on Crimea was useful.
The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that the last meeting of the Security Council on Crimea had been useful and transmitted to Interfax.
"I think the discussion was useful to us, and we gave them information about what happened," said Churkin.
He explained that, in closed consultations, he had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and had read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which “explained concern and indignation over the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

Italy's debt increased to record levels
In June 2016, Italy's debt exceeded Euro2.248 trillion.
In the Central Bank, countries stated that this amount was a historic maximum, passing on the RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.
The debt then reached Euro2.228 trillion.
It is noted that Italy's debt burden increased by Euro77.2 billion during the first half of the year.
It had previously been reported that by the end of 2015, Italy ' s State had accounted for 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, had predicted a decline of 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
The airport payments were paid to 141 victims of the Domododo terrorist attack.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Foundation, which was established by the Domododo airport management to assist victims of the 2011 terrorist attack, reports Interfax.
According to Alexander Vlasov Airport Spokesperson, two additional applications are under consideration.
“The Fund continues its charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides full assistance to address existing issues”, added Vlasov, recalling that a fund website containing full information on the modalities of charitable assistance had been set up specifically to facilitate interaction with victims.

As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed and 172 others were injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The international team of biologists concluded that the longest-lived spinal cord was the Greenland polar shark, which could live for about 500 years, and transmitted RT.
Scientists conducted a radio-carbon analysis of the density of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolicity plays an important role in the shark’s long life, leading to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks are only about 150 years old.
Previously, it was thought that the longer all the vertebrates live, the shark's neighbour, the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years of age.
Putin has changed the composition of Sovbeda's Russian Federation.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia by decree amended the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation and reported to the Kremlin Press Service.
It was previously known that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov from his post of Chief of Administration and his successor, Anton Weino.
Ivanov will now serve as Special Representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
Of the permanent members of the FMS, Rashid Nurgaliev ' s deputy officer was deleted.
The Council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Weino, half to the President of the FNL, Sergei Menilo, and half to the FNL, Nicolai Tsukanov.
Sergey Ivanov was released from office as President's Chief of Administration.
By presidential decree, Sergey Ivanov was released from the position of Head of the Kremlin Administration.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environmental, Environmental and Transport Activities.
Anton Weino, former Deputy Sergey Ivanov, was appointed as the new head of administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked for another job.
Should you go to a sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the Olga Bogsh sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, is he just tired of his job, or should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanitary rest is necessary not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her body and receive medical advice on how to live so that his or her health will not be ruined.
Such recommendations would not be unnecessary.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal from the body, and you don't have to miss it.
Constant stress, mental and physical weariness can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And about 90 percent of visitors are under stress.
In addition, people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are the most vulnerable.
So it's better not to make things difficult and let yourself rest on time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people are declining their biological age during their stay in sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are health programmes, which include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, analyses and treatments.
For example, navigation (in many sanatoriums there are children ' s basins), inhalation, special feeding, massages, oxygen cocktails, and physical therapy.
The course of procedure is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual evidence and the particulars of the growing organism.
In addition, the sanatoriums tend to operate a children ' s club with animators, where children can attend play classes and various workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to visitors with infants, provide breastfeeding facilities and provide services to an experienced babysitter.
The soft summer winter, which lasts a long summer, provides good conditions for a year’s rest in the Caucasus Mineral Water resorts (over 300).
And then the body needs rest, not just in summer.
So there is no need to be afraid of the weather behind the window, especially since most procedures take place in the room and are not dependent on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
Of course, the main site of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is the treatment mineral sources: Slavyan, Smyrnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect the various systems of the body.
Water varies according to temperature, quantity of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water according to the patient's feelings.
Thus, “Narzan” has an anti-inflammatory, immuno-immunosing effect, restoring the function of the stomach and intestine tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces sugar levels.
“Essentuci new” has an anti-inflammatory, yellowish and urinal effect.
The waters of Slavyanski have the same effects.
In the assignment of water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he collects less salty water because the salts delay the liquid, resulting in increased pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires a regime: water should be drank at a certain time, at the required quantity and temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in the sanatoriums.
What types of recovery, based on the natural features of the Northern Caucasus, can be obtained at resorts in the region?
Near Piygorsk, for example, is Lake Tambukan, a salty mud that is useful for joints, spines, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dispersal, immunostimating effect.
It's a healthy walk along individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take baths of wine, pearly, yono-friendly, spleen, philphen-lacrical, depending on what a doctor can give you.
Long-term fertility.
What can you do to make your harvest go through the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belouchov, agribusiness and daisy.
It is high time for the tomato to set a haircut: remove the new pastures, cut the puppies, remove all the leaves until the last brush with the fruit and the small-tempered blossoms are ripe.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution”, and peppers and eggplants, shall be sprayed with a gold/supperphosphate extraction, biopredator (Expertive - to accelerate the flow and growth of the fruits, Phitosporin-M, Fitowin, Hamir, Bactofitis - from diseases, Immunoctophyte - to enhance immunity, Bitocsibucilin, Lepidocide, Pytoverm - if there are pests).
Only copper domes, colloquid sulphur, and green soap are worth using at the end of summer.
We're making the last flood of plants.
The long-lived cucumbers in the heat are allowed from the paper so that the lower, nude part of the stem (25-40 cm) of the stem to the ground, watered with warm water and the solution of the Circon, and attached to the stalk 5-7 cm compost.
It is also easy to extend the fertilizing process by cutting off the old leaves, pouring warm water, and fertilizing the whole plant, putting the fertile soil under a bush.
To protect against nighttime colds, place an arc above the seat with covered material.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close them when the sun sets.
The sign of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from Russia’s longest recession in the last 20 years.
As Bloomberg analysts have noted, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend - GDP fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter of GDP.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to recent data from Rosstat, the fall in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed down to 0.6 per cent.
The situation has also recently been stabilized by Central Bank and Minecomom development.
Forward is slow growth.
According to experts from the CDI, the recession in the Russian economy remains a thing of the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP tells us that the recession is behind us and that the economy is growing slowly ahead," says a bulletin of the Bank of Russia entitled "What Trends Say."
The marginal estimate of GDP for the current quarter has increased to 0.4 per cent, with an estimate of 0.5 per cent for the fourth quarter.
During the second quarter of GDP, the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter of the year, as reported by the representative of Minaconom Development.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, it stopped: in April, it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, the GDP change was between 0 and 0.15,” quoted the representative of RIA, “News”.
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the past five blocks shows that “needly passed”.
Among other markers that point to the renaissance of the national economy, Bloomberg refers to the increasing demand for electricity and rail transport, and the revitalization of business.
If an adjustment is made to the fact that the year is high, it is understandable that the dynamics of plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption may be due to an additional workday.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is an increase in freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and a plus minus 0.5 per cent of semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BRUD.
However, there are other more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, for the past two weeks, Rosstat has been recording deflation.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If we look at the dynamics of the rouble, which, although showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that should be followed by indicators from the real economy,” says Yakovenko.
In addition, industrial production has increased since April in the Russian Federation.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7 per cent.
The drop in foreign trade from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May slows down.
The positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent.
It was only below September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the good situation in the labour market, the question of real income-possessed populations would be left to want better.
In annual terms, the figure falls by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder economic recovery, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
Generally, they account for more than 50 per cent of the economic structure.
In addition to low consumption activity, the firm policy of the Bank of Russia can also be described as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator retains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the inadequate level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
In general, however, it may be assumed that by the end of the year the fall of the Russian Federation economy will have slowed to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says an analyst to SC Force Club Irina Rogova.
The naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports on the Olympics in Sochi, has not been so actively developed in summer sports.
While the Olympics in Rio favour Russia and former foreigners, they are mostly natives of former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can see the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality varies.
Some parents were taken to another country while they were still young, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a place in the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for sports development abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In a German passport, a 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be Elizabeth, of course.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow the footsteps of her older sister -- to play light athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose a six-foot jump.
She's staying in Russia, and she's unlikely to be able to "strip off the throne" Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, on the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only native, albeit former, in the sixth race.
Its best achievements in this form are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental firstborn in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pyrozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the gospel.
Because of their faith, they left for the U.S. when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight more children in the family.
They all lived in a small town called Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started getting involved in the fight in school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her training at the U.S. Training Centre under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Iznikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first match.
But at the World Championship that year, victory.
Prior to that, she had won a silver prize in the world ' s first year of 2010.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavla, where she was first introduced to synchronized navigation.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our trainers in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and live in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was part of the U.S. assembly and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists are unable to compete, but for America, their indicators are ceilings.
The new name, which sounds strangely Russian, was given at 11 years of age when her parents decided to continue to teach the girl art gymnastics around the ocean.
Up until now, the girl has been involved in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavla.
While emigrating in the United States, she quickly joined the young man’s assembly in that country and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Cristen won gold and silver.
In the first positions on the world stage, of course, she didn't have to fight, but for the U.S., she organized a real breakthrough -- she brought out a star-splitt assembly at the Rio Olympic Games.
Another of our former artists is Jan Beresko Marggrader, who is in favour of Germany's gathering.
She was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects of entering the national assembly.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
True, she was able to occupy only 17 places that were not sufficient to get into the final competitions of her personal firstborn.
Two years earlier, she had won the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - boys.
Another gymnast, this time alone, is Irina Sazonov.
If the ways to emigrate the previously mentioned athletes are standard, the choice of the Irina family is unusual: Iceland.
Ira is a student at Volgograd Sports School.
In Iceland, of course, she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia - is specially visiting his country to keep her skills.
In Rio, she did not speak as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in a private milieu.
There's very little evidence of Mary Ugolkov's gossip in the Russian information area.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and being trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing good results — even the country's record at a distance of 200 metres.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began to speak under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in an integrated estaphet 4x100.
To get to play, the girl launched a crowdfanding project, which helped her to collect some 6,000 francs to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old freestyle fighter, Adam Battiv, spent almost all his career under Russian flag.
During this time, Hasavurt was able to become a three-fold player of European championships, Russian champion, master of international sports in Russia.
When he stopped getting into our national assembly, it was time to think about changing nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports posts.
The triumphal return took place at the Asian championshipship in 2016 - Battiv was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russianine, Michael Kodnov, is even less famous in the country than even Swiss gossiping Maria Umolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began his sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40 seats on parallel beams.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Nasté, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her exercises with simultaneous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European championship in Berlin, the girl ranked 6th in synchronic navigation.
In a duet with Eugenia, Thetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was the fifth in the salt program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter is in favour of Israel's assembly.
When he was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dimitry became a champion of the country by the age of 17.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later Creiter also wins the gold of the young Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to leaps to height, Demetrius is involved in the length and triple jumps.
Albert, 31 years old, is another member of Hasavurt, who, after many long speeches for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
Unlike Batirov, however, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he advocated for the Krasnoyarsk Higher Sports Training School, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
A 28-year-old named Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a assembler of the USSR on the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
Just one year before the birth of the son of Jaroslav, he was recognized as the best volleyballist on earth.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family stayed on permanent residence.
In 2015, he became part of the national team as a bronze player of the European Championship held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was joined by his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original objective was Norway, but it was not possible for the northern part of the country to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to study the free struggle.
He soon won the primacy of peace among his peers and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only French representative for the combat tournament.
And once again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we're talking about the North Ossetian native who emigrated to Spain, Tymuras Freeiev.
At the end of December 2012, he had been granted Spanish citizenship and was now in favour of a collective team of that country.
Before that, it was true that 30-year-old athletes had been able to record high results in Russia as well.
It became a bronze prizer for the 2007 and 2008 championships of the country.
Instinct from non-appropriation to collect, Tymuras decided to change sports nationality.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital city of Dagestan Mahhakal, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began boxing on his older brother’s advice.
Since then, Arthur has been a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he was a champion of the world among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan-American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why are children in school at the kayaky classroom?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, “the people must be brought up, not by actions and parades, but by systematically”.
They must grow up and realize from at least 7 years of age that they are cassava and education must be cassava.
But as long as this work seems to be being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the cassava classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everyone's drunk and we don't know how, the new idea will turn out to be cheap populism.
The LHC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is a shortfall in funds allocated to the public domain from budgets at different levels.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, overt tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of LHC.
As a result, the region ' s consumers overpaid over 170 million roubles.
On the days before the Office of the Prosecutor of the Krasnodar Province, the inclusion of unnecessary costs in the tariffs was found.
A total of 4 million roubles for rental of vehicles at a higher price than the market have been charged to the WI-Consulting GS (for cold water).
And these are country-specific examples of mass.
The people pay the latest money for “commune” and pay the right money, according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, an average collection rate of 94 per cent.
He is charged with a number of articles of the Penal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the version of the investigation, as the head of the fund involved in the renovation of urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, and the work on them was not actually done but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
And as owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers didn't pay and spend it on their own.
As a result, the budget and residents are affected by millions of roubles.
Macarov's scheme of connivance is typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of U.S. leaders, who have allocated money to citizens.
The trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is ongoing in Kamchatka, also by a former member of the commissary who is charged with 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elyso Kamchatsk province, it established 6 company managers and established 3 limited-responsibility societies.
One of them performed contractual work for the UK, and two others played the role of accounting centres, i.e., the public accepted money.
However, energy A. Cohan did not enumerate funds but spent money on himself, my loved one.
It's difficult to judge in the area of LUC.
Cases don't get excited, they get stuck.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing law, says Svetlan Reszczebny, executive director of the NP, "JCAC Control."
We don't have time to make one law, like we're making up a new one that has to make the previous one work.
There are also few professionals, including among the judges, in the area of LUC.
Lawyers themselves recognize that very little attention has been paid to housing law in higher education.
Failures to initiate criminal proceedings and interference in investigations are also reported in the Office of the Attorney-General.
Less than half of the crimes pending before the courts in 2015.
In the remaining cases, the investigation has taken a long time and 1 out of 5 has been suspended due to a failure to identify the accused.
Often, shortcomings in law enforcement are described as gaps in existing legislation.
The law is there, but the authorities are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were approximately 230 reports of frauds - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
During the five months of the current year, the number has only increased slightly - 99.
What is falsification of the living room record?
This means that the change in home administration, financial and other matters goes against the views of owners.
And that also means that the housing and municipal services market cannot be marketed by normal companies who want to work honestly rather than "do" the population.
It turns out the residents are in the miniscule, small and medium-sized businesses, too.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as such throughout the State, Mr. Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Committee on Property Issues.
This work is now under active control.
These are not just single shares; they are targeted against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, there are scandals in the capital.
Why are there no scandals in Moscow in the area of LUC, as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and ordered order, and told AIF Anatoly Electoral, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I am referring both to the personnel issue and to legislative amendments and legal education.
Managers have been closely supervised and all have been licensed.
The complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in public space (and the petitions of residents and the response measures are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Not only do many pay monthly receipts but they pay close attention to what it says.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource providers and managers of organizations is very high.
The Moscow Plus verifys the validity of the tariffs on housing and municipal services, since a large part of the budget is allocated subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess it's all together and it explains the calm in Moscow.
Is it true that everything is going against the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the homeless should change their place of work.

Can Erdogan give up his friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Reggie Taip Erdogan, presented the United States with an ultimatum, proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethhullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d ' état.
He stated this by speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up their support for "Fethullahist terrorist organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is called upon to change its position.
Experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Early or later America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.
Either the organizing coup d ' état of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," quotes Anatoli Agency Erdogan’s appeal on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again demanded that the United States comply with his demand for the first time in the aftermath of his rebellion.
We will recall that on the night of 16 July in Turkey, high-ranking Turkish army representatives attempted to overthrow legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regep Erdogan appealed to the population, the rebellion was suppressed and his organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of 8,000 people were suspected of being in the ranks of military teachers and scientists.
Rejep Erdogan believes that Föthullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., was their mentor.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be involved in a coup d’état.
The Panel recommends no award of compensation in the amount of US$49 million for all claims to its effect by refusing to issue Gülen and recommending a change in tone.
The last statement made by the representatives of Gosdep in this regard was at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey; it insists on its own and also demands other Western partners.
“Ankar will cease to meet its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels calls the date on which the visa restrictions for Turkish citizens are lifted”, stated on 9 August by Omer Chelik, Minister for EU Affairs.
He said that the amendment of the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Note that on 1 August, German Vice-Centre Ziegmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open up borders for migrants in order to facilitate visa arrangements with the EU.
His words were in response to the relevant statement made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Melulate Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement made by Chavushoglu last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not receive the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign States in the defence field, importing missiles," said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkish has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others”, said the Minister.
The experts believe that all of this is evidence of Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The Head of the International Institute of Political Assessment, Eugeni Minchenko, believes that Reggie Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go through a violent confrontation with the West.
He has very much to do with the West and from a business perspective, and from a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be easier for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this position," AIF.ru explained.
According to him, after a Turkish leader (the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for a non-disclosure space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he would be pressured.
“Regent Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and will be pressured on him on humanitarian issues, on the dictatorial management of the country, and so forth”, Minsk said.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey is changing his view with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago Erdogan took an extremely harsh stand against Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after a while the President of Turkey is not changing his priorities.
I think Erdogan entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
When he finds himself between two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to get the greatest benefit for himself,” he says.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today was to retain political power in the country, which was precisely why he needed Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which control the situation in Syria and in the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey”, the expert considers.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasov, takes a different view.
The relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are now rather tense, and this is primarily linked to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I believe that this crisis will worsen in relations, and against this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to overload policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, state that they are prepared to change their position on a number of issues concerning Syria, have been resolved relations with Israel, are actively engaged in political engagement with Iran,” explained AIF.ru Glasov, allowing the next step of Erdogan to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy that Erdogan was now pursuing was the return to the foreign policy framework followed by Turkey prior to the Arab revolutions.
“At that time, Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the position of `no problems with neighbours'.
The President of Turkey has now made very good visits to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and strengthen Turkey's position on both the regional and international fronts”, the expert considers.
Glasgow believes that returning Turkey to its previous relationship with the EU will be extremely difficult, but the question is whether the EU will rather be rigidly in line with Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus pose serious problems for Europe.
Letters from junior doctors: appeals for new collective protests
The junior doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The JDC Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) is about to request its full advice to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC said the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It rejected 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to “reservedly” on issues that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “In view of the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation of all your issues.”
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC leader issued a formal request today for an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to endorse a continuous programme of expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
Dr. Joan Malawana, head of BMA junior doctors, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the transaction was a good one to be made during the meetings leading up to the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alians bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the gilded palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tense, and he hardly emitted heat even according to his own restraint standards.
In contrast, Reggie Taip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend", Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I've lost my bill.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level but even to a higher level.
The following day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the other way around.
But the prolonged cold from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey had beaten down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was obsessive.
Mr. Putin was struck by an angry fever, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow's back.
The insult was even stronger on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real confidence would be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it appeared that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations from senior management were that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family had been driven by the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it firmly.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received an apology that he had requested of President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the advantages of a Truce announcement are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he's almost been removed from his post last month when he tries to turn around.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have severely hit — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90 per cent.
As for Russia, the tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when the flights finally resume.
They peak the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Turkers over there, tomatoes back here," as the report said in the newsmagazine.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ancara's evil to the West for what she thinks is a weak answer to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged discontent by talking about joining the EU and Mr. Putin's step, which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties to the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after an attempted coup d ' état.
Bear in mind, this is a gift to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described me as “the Aljans bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, however, the two still differ significantly.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently placed itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps it is for themselves that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two Presidents gave a press conference, they did not even address the issue.
The Turkish President had deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin had preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it is best that two leaders speak at least again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be reduced to the role of a bex office, according to the bank executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank withdrew from them ever since it almost died eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer loans.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsored international sport, from the Cuban Cup of six nations to the championship of Wimbledon Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is appropriate to allow more national brands to take the lead.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank has already been used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will have more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan interviewed during the tour of clients and staff at Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "The RBS will eventually become our investment brand and what our staff will be doing, because we are now more of a bank of brands."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we have no more global aspirations; we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is a good time for us to move a brand bank because (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving a bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on customers' needs, not on our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can get these brands back again, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettore comes to 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmark on the Prisity.
The detectors spraying champagne after a double in Newmark leads it to 3,000 wins.
Jokhey Frankie Dettori won his 3000 British victory in Newmark on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Passion, taught by John Hosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is a sixth jockey that has reached this outstanding mark in smooth leaps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pyggott, Pat Idderi and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of the Dethori Finger, who had won on Ghayar, said, "This is something special."
I'm really excited because my family's here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmark, because it was here that I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not a Royal Azot, it's a regular Friday night of 20000 people.
I'm free of business, and I'm very untenable.
The detectors take applause when they bring forward preposition after victory.
The two jockeys reached such a sign in the leaps with obstacles: the champion Richard Johnson and the retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins his record career.
Lester Pyggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career winners
Frankie is one of the finest jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached this point that so few have reached before him.
He's styled and strong, but he's the one who's the one who's the tactical one that separates him from others in the spring room.
He's a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Eps, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a jockey of weekends and big leaps!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners to Britain for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for the British jumps, but he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding brand - name brand - of brand-new jump from horse to horse.
From rapid finish to rapid nipples, Francie Datori has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It was take-off and fall.
A lot of the winners of the big race, including his famous "The Great Seven" in Ascott in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified because of doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualifying, but he demonstrated a great deal of will to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while — the detectors have said before that they would like to continue participating in the competitions, at least until 50 years of age.
Putin dismisss the Chief of Administration, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted neighborhood for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed environmental and transport representative.
The statement from Kremlin states that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as President's head of Russian administration” but did not give any reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy, Anton Weino, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the Government ' s President ' s and Government ' s Protocol, reporting on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your work as Head of State in drafting laws and in monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin informed one Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be removed from office and had recommended that Vaino replace it.
Do Smiles Persuase?
It's a move that's puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, has served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin on public television, both men stated that the Chief of Administration had resigned on his own behalf.
But despite the smiles on the camera, this is hardly convincing — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official statement — that a man who was once promoted as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy — was met with great scepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult position, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, I've been president of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the Head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President after Putin's second term, because the third term for Putin would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, another close supporter, Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, took the post.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is fired after a producer fight.
Gibson was a party at the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studies, which produce serials, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in filming and differences of opinion.
I am sorry that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that monitors the FBI agents team is expected to be received later, according to ABC Studies and CBS Television Studies.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played the leading role in the Citcoma Darma and Greg has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love to think as a criminal and put my heart and soul in him for the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of my life, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the scriptors, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, above all, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It's scheduled for the show to come back with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mysterious: The fish landed in the garden of Banffa
A man from Banffa sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banffa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could have been sands left behind by a water Death.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, filmed this star in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge is now connected to Fif.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern passage and the Vivaduksferry Crossing — which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
This is the first of the four fights between the veracity of the canvas that are now approaching the completion of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Fif Bridge Section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 per cent of a bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnesses of engineering art on a really epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of all the bridge canvas is now on the ground, and for the last section of the canvas, concrete is being poured out in Rosate today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to go up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Project, said, "The first grip on every design of the bridge is always a milestone.
In this amazing project, this condensation is the most modern construction art.
After the installation of the last section of the road cloth and its connection to the expanding North Pilot Road Line, we were left with the remaining gap on the north — or on the shore — on our side.
This was done by pulling a northward viduc approach 700 millimetres south.
It was a large-scale but very elegant operation.
Large because the vaudex is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be raised to about 3% of the slope.
Fine because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny — only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went very well.
"Salvation in the Gulf of Moalfr: Three men were lucky to be alive."
Three men were lucky to stay alive after being thrown off a fishing ship in England.
The Moelfrre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13.20 British summer time on Friday, after the crew saw an accident unfolding in the Bay of Molfrey.
Three men tried their best to reach safety while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship go around them and assume the worst," said the motorboat Moelfre Vince Jones.
“luckily, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind had driven him away from them, ” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel and a third man, 60 years old, was found to be exhausted and stuck in a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all raised on board the coast lifeboat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky that they are alive and completely innocent.
The engine of the boat had an emergency sprayer, but he somehow got away from the man driving the boat when it woke up.
Somebody chose these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
That teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people away from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games, and recently smartphones.
It's so good to see technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, I'm talking about the full involvement of Pokémon Go, the annex on the basis of the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the result was a series of cartoons, games cards and other responses).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, all of this has become obsolete a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries was then delayed because of the mass reaction that the servers had overloaded.
Pokémon Go had more users in his days than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Poukemones that are tracked by GPS and, when found, may be 'photo photographed' (through your phone box) or 'snick'.
A generation that played games while younger joined in the vortex of the showy display, breaking away from the couches to search for.
In the United States, games have led to a significant increase in the number of steps being taken by the “normal” person daily.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days from the start of the game, the number of people being tracked, who performed 30-minute exercises daily, had jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees primary data on levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to find 30 minutes, to stand up from the couch, and to be active every day have not been responded because most health-care messages are boring and say people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pulls people outside to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: traffic, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends hunting.
As usual, there are boring boreholes who are looking for something to say.
And yes, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphone applications like Fitbit could keep track of our physical activity, they wouldn't give us any reason for doing things like this game.
The newcomer swears, and use will weaken over time.
However, Pokemon's success will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simon Byles wins the gold of absolute primacy in female gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the sadness.
Simon Byles is not incontrovertible for all this.
Dynamic at the support jump.
Unforced on the log.
That's crazy on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Championship.
A 19-year-old American gymnastics rose to the title of the absolute first champion on Thursday, placing the gap between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the relative Olympic attention.
Her total score was 6.2198 sufficiently far from the silver medalist and comrade on Eli Riceman's Final Five team and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bails, from the United States, serves on the gymnastic log during the finale of women's absolute primacy in artistic gymnastics at 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute primacy and the fifth in general, affirming her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She was crying when she showed her final general score and her long journey by this point had ended.
This achievement places it in the same league as extremely rare lunges, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bails spent the last three years, dominant in her form of sport, winning 15 medals of the World Championship -- including 10 gold medals -- with such amazing programs in their mixture of labour and precision that Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic Championship, called her “the greatest gymnast I have ever seen.”
One last test was in Brazil, and the competition was not so much between Bails and others in this area as it was between her and the weight of overestimated expectations.
Anything smaller than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an unreasonable expectation.
Simon Bails, from the United States, on the left, and Eli Rysman, embraces after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finale of female individual absolute primacy in artistic gymnastics at Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bails earned the first gold on Tuesday, became a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retired coordinator of the National Assembly of Martha Caroly.
While Bails insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the summit, it wasn't exactly that.
A part of her free exercise program, which includes her corporate walkway, is set up on Latin music, which would fit directly into the streets outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl adopted by her grandparents as a child and opened up by the mother of coach Amy Burman during her visit to the room where Burman was a coach became a force.
It has not lost any absolute first competition since summer 2013, a lucky strip that must continue for as long as Bails will.
Although Mustafina won a small advantage by means of two orientations, it was a mirage.
Hymnastic log and arbitrary exercises — where Bails defends the title of the World Champion — are ambushed.
It went forward again with 15.433 on the log and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Riceman gave her a soft hug while they were waiting for the final account — a clean formality — and tears appeared around a brilliant red and white foothold for Bails' eyes, when the design she had once recorded in the scrap album came true.
Rysman's performance was a little revenge for four years ago when she divided third place, but she lost Mustafina's bronze on a Thai-bright.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call grandmother, was much ahead of us.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her voluminous exercise, covered by return, which sometimes appeared to be in question.
With regard to the Byles, a 19-year-old virus Twitter from the beginning of this week is now quite new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Finix in the last decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochel Lyner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway and told the authorities.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hiding on another vehicle, reported in the report.
The police state that the triple murder does not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the purse or $2,900 that had been held by an adult victim.
A representative of the Finix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted the investigators to check whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, branch of CBS, early this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, black BMW at the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked to each other and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31 years old, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were killed.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car while listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shelling, which was intended to be an empty pick-up truck half an hour before the three-hour murder, and which is believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
Investigators found the Giles and removed the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
A mother of a six-year-old baby with a microcept: "It's getting better."
As most six - year - olds, Edmund Pixioto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
Unlike most of his peers, however, Edmund’s microcephalia was the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Piccisto, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which, in fact, isn't true -- of course you're signing for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing it," I explained to Piccisto.
Edmund walks by walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's going through some stages slowly.
He goes out with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "Please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Pictio CBS News said.
But more than just a common sign language, she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia can arise from a variety of circumstances: genetics, such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and zica.
Symptoms and projections may vary considerably.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zik virus.
Pixioto remembers emotional loss because of an uncertain future.
I've been telling you what's gonna happen all the time?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifelong prognosis, because I don't really expect anyone to really tell me.
But Piccisto has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zik.
It's getting better.
You know everything's going to be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding, causing rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday.
Numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have left the coast and are threatening large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Louisiana John Belle Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already moved to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor ' s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were received for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steve said it was the arrival of Tanjipaha that only invited tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could bend into an area.
In southern Alabama, the call for the flood continued until Friday, as the rain continued to flow in the area of Mobil.
The Comet River next to Baton-Ruze and the Amit River next to Dene Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to set a record of flood levels last weekend.
The synoptic Alec Krautmann said that the two rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Ruge.
He also said that the flood that flows down the Assensen approach was a threat, as these rising rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Ticfo River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The rescuers were still taking people out of the floods in Amitt and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pastries were among those saved early Friday night near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that Beaver Creek's waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another shepherd boy who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water continued to attack," said Hansford.
She reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford it's the biggest tributary she's ever seen in 48 years that lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three by means of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is “swiftly spreading”, as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was flooded with rainfall from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have resulted in rescue work for residents from Tanjipahoa ' s houses and the abolition of classes in five school districts, which have been claimed by the authorities.
WWL, a branch office of CBS, reports that Adviser Tanjipahoa described 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now being drowned.
The President of Robbie Miller's visit stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven high-water domestic animals.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amitt and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They'll have an opportunity to go home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high level of water, and sand bags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had in March," said Lacey Landrum, governor of the city.
It's on the way to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Rupert Lacey, Head of Emergency Services, reported that heavy rain continued to rain on the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses had been registered as being flooded on Thursday, but none had been registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Chopper Value Foods store in Amitt, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tuusson, "and it still flies to the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "gone-out bullets," survives the shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shot at a six-year-old in town this week.
Grandma and Grandpa of the baby identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahruz Brown.
My grandmother and grandpa are told that Brown was injured by numerous guns, including his scent, leg, arm and stomach, but was unconscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He's got a lot of pressure, his little body has been fired with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical hospital and has experienced several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot at in the Germantawn block.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be critical; two other victims have been registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that there seems to have been a exchange of fire between several armed people.
Halves from semi-automatic weapons attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have formed the scene.
I think it was definitely a long battle.
There were branches on the street, on both sides of the side of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the gunfighting,” the police captain of Philadelphia Antony Ginaldi reported to the station.
Many houses and machines in the area were also equipped with a gasket.
No arrests have been made and the police are reported to have been watching video cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was hit in her hand by a bullet on Tuesday, playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Laurie
That's what I call a women's Olympic assembly for this year's gymnastics and for a few reasons.
First, I've been on every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnaecists play a key role in this collection: Simon Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laurent “Lory” Hernández, who have inspired so many unwhite girls.
The composition of this collected, supplemented by Ali Riceman, who is a Jew, and Madison Cochan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This assembly looks like America at last.
It has also strengthened the black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the female gymnasium number one has been an African American woman.
Simon and Gabby were 1 and 2 last year.
It's powerful.
In the past, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
Now the world could be witness to the incredible performances of the three-time Peace Championship Simona Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, who performed unexpected but nevertheless explosive gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became American fourth consecutive player, winning gold in female individual absolute primacy.
And Ali Rysman's colleague made silver.
We witness the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look that way in the gymnasiums around the country.
Simona, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic gymnasium will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Marta Carolie's training.
But in reality, gymnasium is a expensive sport, and gymnasiums are first trained in private gymnasium clubs supported by parents who pay the cost of education, equipment, travel, uniforms, contributions for participation in competitions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasium clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where the gymnasiums get everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term responsibility for the families of the gymnasts.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Bails, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Hernández, both have been training their athletes since they started being gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable training for gymnastics to communities of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (mostly blacks and Latin Americans) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand in Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and persistence of mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this collection that will send thousands of girls to take on gymnastics, which is beautiful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning team Olympian gold and for driving so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have initiated further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to complete the change dispute by agreeing with the British Medical Association leaders, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce this contract, saying that NHS was on “no land” and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night work changes and vacations to improve services during off-curricular hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Young Physicians of BMA last night, said in a statement: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly”.
It is only eight weeks before the first team of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is needed to complete.
The attempt by the VMA to resolve the dispute was met with a reluctance to act and sometimes with silence from the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jermy Hunte needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of junior doctors.
If he fails to do so, it is clear that the doctors are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
In late April, the last point was delayed by some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses' receptions, while nurses and consultants were engaged to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing on a revised contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
IAQ wants a better holiday payment for 54,000 junior doctors who are subject to a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS Employers, encouraged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The strikes are few or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in operation, and they cause concern, physical pain and disorders, to patients, to situers and to their families.”
During the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine, were signs of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health in meeting the conditions reached by the IA in November, February and May.
A drug for 2 ? a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attacks are going to use a drug for 2 ? a day, after the authorities have recommended that they give it to a larger number of people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-retroviral drug reduces the risk of reabsorption for people with heart disease.
The drug is already assigned for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE supervision service of the British National Health Service has advised that it be given to people for four years in order to avoid further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE surveillance service of the British National Health Service has now advised that it be given to people for four years in order to avoid further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of arteries and the formation of canes.
If the cane breaks apart, it can lead to a trombo that prevents blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if it moves around, it can move through the blood flow and block the blood into the brain by causing a stroke.
People who already have one attack are at greater risk of receiving another.
The tiger produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold as Brilique reduces the risk by making the tropics less likely.
The NICE draft instruction published today recommends that people give 90 mg of thycalorone for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, there will be another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that the tiger, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes from people who have already experienced a heart attack.
By pre-advising the tiger, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the tiger — especially the risk of bleeding — was limited after three years, the draft instruction did not recommend treatment longer than that time limit.
The PK culture makes it possible to flourish in the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer Tauer-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, instigating the Government ' s report
The culture of political adjustment has led to the closure of the eyes, which has resulted in widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the destructive report of the Government made available today.
The former Cabinet member, Sir Eric Prickles, has been criticized by the police, election observers and city administrations for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of “excess sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former local secretary, now anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that the police should be allowed to place borders outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indescribable ink on people's fingers when they hand down their ballot papers, with a view to excluding someone from voting twice.
Better protection should be provided to the whistle-blowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access by the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it”, he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with electoral matters decided that the current Mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office because of the long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “scientically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, “proclaimed his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the Muslim believers to vote in his behalf.”
Up to 300 votes were in doubt or were the result of persevering when a person voted as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidences of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly concerned about the mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote in favour of their choice.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
The report states: “There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote on the will of the elders, especially in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.
“There have been fears that... public institutions have closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of `political adjustment' to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from the mail ballot papers to stop the “harvest of votes”.
The record, which is under consideration by Teresa May, also calls for tight checks in registration to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to present their identity cards before voting is under consideration.
Use unpaved ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of people ' s nationality to make sure that they have the right to vote.
To impose a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
To prevent political campaigners and activists from working with filled-in absentee ballots and post-mail envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set boundaries around the polling stations.
Amend the Act to facilitate the prosecution of people for intimidation in accordance with the submission of the National Act of 1983.
To take illegal photographs at polling stations.
To require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that the staff forces the voters to go one by one.
Sir Eric aggressively attacked the city police, saying that it was “extremely” that no criminal charges had been brought after the Tauer Hamletts case.
“The election judge disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and unlawful acts,” he reported.
He was found guilty without reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on several grounds.
He also criticizes the resultless “checkings for the purpose of marking” of the city administration's electoral registration offices.
Sir Eric said: "The last year ' s court order in Tauer Hamlets was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as a mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Cate and other doubles of the famous Olympics in Rio
The Olympic fans of Rio 2016 went crazy this week on the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevo, which appears to be an impressive surprise to the Duchy of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old member of the Olympics is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous doubles — at least in social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens at the moment, FNAME has compiled a list of Olympics with more than a superficial similarity to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. male archer Brady Allison, on the left, compared to Leonardo DeCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double-deck on a bicycle track, many people are quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of Leonardo Dizprio's superstar.
A U.S. male archer named Brady Allison caused a hurricane in Twitter when images of him appear frighteningly similar to Wall Street’s Wall Street Star.
And in fact, the archer learned about social media madness and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally see no great similarity, there may be except vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point to even more this year: the striking similarity between the British jump of Greg Raserford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gynaecist Alia Mustafina, with her large, clear eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the South African beach, Cameron Van der Burga was compared to the star of Hora Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to a more unexpected thing: This user thinks Nathan is the “disputing version” of "Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Raphael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julius Efimov, may boast not only of the same naked skin and light hair as that of actress Anna Lynne McCord, whereas Nathan Adrián of the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like “the controversial version of Joseph Gorgon Levit”.
Surrogate women: Hope Solo, on the left and Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, have the same face and eye shape as Dexter.
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why this pair is similar in appearance.
One Twitter user recently turned to the website to announce his passion that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter actress have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of Lora Linni's actress, as well as the winning gold medal of Gabby Douglas, who can boast of his own beautiful broad smile, which looks like a smile of the star "Fine Success" Gabriel Union.
Commentator Olympiad on CBC apologizes for saying "sold like a pig" on the Chinese pen.
Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place on the 14-year-old Ai Yianhaan on a 4x200 m free-style women's estaphet has outraged CBC viewers on the live broadcast of Olympiad
The Canadian broadcast company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese filming "started as a flame" and "died as a pig" during a swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was hired by CBC commentators to "severe it in color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
I'm too excited, I'm getting old, I'm dead like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China’s 14 - year - old Ai Yianhan, who was able to sail through the second stage of the estaphet at 1:57.79, was 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to bridge China’s backlog.
The audience across Canada responded quickly to the network after being shaken by tone and used expressions
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Is CBC really just saying that a 14-year-old spit out of China died like a pig?"?
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
And they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped a ball, baby."
Twitter criticism immediately hit Byron McDonald, and many urged him to quit.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote, "No one likes #BirronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who broadcast CBC, apologized on live for his comment by McDonald, saying: 'We apologize for the fact that the comment on the presentation on navigation has been broadcast on the air.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who were following this comment
Friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The body too was quick to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers on live air and to our social media subscribers.
Let us make it clear that Byron’s comments were directed to the presentation of the deaf, not to it as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live and tried to clarify his comment by stating that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I would like to take advantage of the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's estaphet,' he said at the CBC Olympics.'
'I've been talking about the silence, not her in person.'
'Sure it meant no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
The buyer, Primark, offended a woman who was using her underwear in the middle of the store with impunity
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman was naked to try to get her panties on the floor with stores in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she showed them how she looked at them, pulled them, and put them back on the regiment.
She continued her search and eventually died of four pairs of underwear in the Bowerie Place Trade Center in Falkland.
The Prymark store center Bouvrie Place in Falkland, where a woman used tacky panties before putting them back on the regiment
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was in the store at the time, said that after an example of a underwear, a mysterious woman again "dressed and left the store and bought nothing."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a couple of panties off the window, took off her own ankles and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a place to do it -- she was just standing there, homeless."
"Everybody stood up when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the regiment."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here she liked, dressed again, and walked out.
"It doesn't seem like she was worried about who was watching her, or that she thought about the person who would eventually buy those panties that she was like."
Jenny Davidson's 33-year-old from Kent said, "It's a shame to think someone's going to take home panties that someone else has worn and they weren't sweaty."
The accident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left -- and the better."
"I wouldn't like to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out that another woman put them in and took them off and they weren't sweaty."
The representative of Primark reported: “Primark is aware of the incident that happened at our store in Falkland on Tuesday 9 August.”
All items in question have been seized from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using a tailor
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misacci, the Master of the Federation of Craps in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether it comes to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat up the robber of his weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Misachi, the first thing to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire".
Then you squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder, before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows the scent, and as the attacker turns away from the pain, you throw the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a gun and step back, holding the weapon on him.
For an armed, fit front, a way of doing things like that -- get your body off the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the thief can't shoot.
At the same time, move your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with your fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before you step back and target him.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Misacci does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not the master of a tailor -- is to give away your cash.
For a traveler, Jan Wright uses his own language in the most filthy places in Europe
A British traveler has been subjected to his immune system and to a serious reflexion, licking some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of the 51-year-old travel books from Saffolk conducted the euro banknote, Circus Piccadili, the button of the toilet off the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of their immunized system.
Before licking every object, he used the lumenometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment to be a film called "Lizan Traveler's Guide on the Internal Force" has produced some surprising results.
The idea of licking a snake button in a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During the entire European trip, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about an increase in intestines and their own health.
Fortunately, none of his fats brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for tests on the strength of his intestines, traveling around the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From public rail stations to the toilet button, the task has certainly been tested by his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "From childhood I've been completely carefree with regard to my health and I've pulled many different things into my mouth from the ground by eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test dab demonstrated the value of the lumimeter of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the hands that have just been washed must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000, while his hands just washed show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish milk producer Valio made a film on a traveler called "Luzin's Guide to the Internal Force," which shows how many bacteria are in different places, for example, in the toilet.
In the film he said, "That's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's horrible.
The "Inner Force Traveller's Guide" was withdrawn with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestines and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories Nico Wuorenma said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see while at the same time be able to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with "let me call Jan."
They claim that an interest in in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in in intestine health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we were able to provide more information to consumers in interesting form.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hacala, who was the director of the film, added, "Let's say that I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film."
Of course, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some of them were rather rigid.
I'm glad we've been able to put some of these on film."
In a 2015 survey, Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid bacteria exclusively to the good condition of the stomach and intestines, while 58 per cent said that they used, at least occasionally, products containing added acid bacteria.
The hooligans' family destroyed Saltas, Cornwall Municipal House, just before the evictions.
The hooligans left their municipal home with losses of 50,000, after they had been evicted for intimidation by their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltas, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from a real estate facility, shocked housing and construction officials found the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the pellets were opened, the garbage was scattered over the floor and the walls were sprayed with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvey, a settler at Cornwall House, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed, because this real estate object will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name is a bad one.
The couple had three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of terror caused by the family included fights on the street with baseball beatens, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and rudders.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease contract, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms of a house that might be snowy, they found old garbage.
The floor boards in a home where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall House forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The evictions were welcomed with relief by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into an evil hell.
One said, "They weren't worried."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because this place was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the neighboring team Cornwall Houseing, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and was regularly called by the police
Mussor and old toys were scattered below the grassy side of the municipal house.
He added, 'It's a shame that the lessee was unable to accept any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, because eviction is always the latest method of action that Cornwall Housering considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the conduct was limited, and their actions must have been terrifying to her watching neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to inform us.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in a house at different times, but said that they were a little over 20 at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the burned houses after the evictions
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the garbage pile that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights, supplies and 1,700 g of cash.
Skeldon was fined after he found himself guilty of class B drug possession for delivery.
She claimed that money was paid for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were filled with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with rent rules.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, stated that this evictions had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'It's a message for those who feel they can act without the prosecutor's charges, and for those who are harmed by such behaviour' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flight military aircraft nearly touched the beach
In the city of Aveira, Portugal, tourists who loved to hunt at the sun were scared of their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it carried out a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while a low - flying aircraft flicks over a crowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen flying near the point of contact from sand hunters in Avero, northern Portugal.
Recreationalists jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft’s engines but were unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa New.
Daniel Fernandesz, one of several recreationers who published a video of shocking social media flight, said, "It went very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed like it would break."
Nuno Arroga added, "I've been surfing and I swear, there was a sense that the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on Aveiro's beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from the mist and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the P-3C Orion pilot had carried out a training mission to detect fishing vessels off the coast and had been forced to descend so low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the plane had flown slightly lower than usual owing to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was at risk.
During the summer, forest fires damaged mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly as low as possible because of the circumstances — the dense fog and the power of forest fires that had made the visibility worse.
The aircraft carried out a training flight and the pilot was instructed to find fishing boats within the framework of the task
The HASSS system has been mandatory for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are getting more active and business is facing fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian version of HASSP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for the use of food by manufacturers and carriers, as well as general demand companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Business checks by Rosneubenzore for compliance with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
In the meantime, however, officials only issue fines for certain violations of regulations (see the “List of Documents”).
The failure to comply with the rules would generally cost an enterprise of 600,000 roubles for the first breach and one million roubles for the second.
HASS, as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of astronaut food.
The system is now being used not only in the United States but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, CHASS has been operating on TC territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years old (the requirements of HASSP appeared in TC regulation 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we had long been convinced that the rule applied only to food production, not to retortors, and explained to the head of the Public Council of Elena Cesarets.
Now everybody's trying to make up for what's missing.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey, at the end of August, at the beginning of September.
But the demand for income will not be met because their target audience -- families with children -- is already preparing for school, experts point out.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter yesterday to the Government requesting the authorization of charterers.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of selecting a quality and accessible sea rest is intractable, since most of the facilities are already reserved for the end of September in the Krasnodar Region and the Republic of Crimea resorts”, the authors point out that the opening of charters in August would not have a significant impact on the demand for Russian sea tour products.
As reported at the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Union, if Russian air agencies and Turkey agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when charters are renewed until then, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
There may be technical flights of aircraft in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly construct the programmes and agree with airlines on the way forward,” says Pavel Rumiants, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RTA.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but it did not affect the marketing of forces, because the main buyers of charter tours -- families with children -- were already back from rest and were preparing for school or spending vacations in other countries.
In the barchat season, tours are mainly purchased by single travellers and couples.
Charity programs can count on those who can rest spontaneously," says Pavel Rumans.
"There is a chance in Turkey to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives a very high budget offer -- 50,000 to 60,000 roubles per tour per two because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valery Rosenthal, Director-General of the Optio-Travel Tourism.
Otherwise, it's definitely not worth the drive. The main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul Rumians also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charterers will be needed, but it is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey to launch charterers now is a rehearsal for the next season," says Pavel Rumans.
"The opening of charterers in Turkey is good news for the next season," Valery Rubtsov agrees.
The tax code provides for exemption from NPFL compensation payments established by law within the limits of approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers employed in hazardous work conditions is prescribed under article 222 of the Criminal Code.
However, the very rules and conditions for extradition are laid down by order No. 45n of the Ministry of Health and Development of the Russian Federation of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foods is made to workers during days of actual employment in hazardous work conditions due to harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these standards, the FNF of Russia concluded in the letter under consideration that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 3, of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, income from the value of milk given to employees during actual work days with harmful working conditions, in accordance with the Regulations and the conditions approved by the Ministry of Health Development of the Russian Federation of 16.02.2009 No. 45n, was exempt.
The Moscow Gasstrobank remained without a CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrawn a licence to bank transactions from a credit organization, the Shareholder's Commercial Bank, GASTRUIBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the AOC, GASSTRUIBANK, has implemented a high-quality credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and an accurate disclosure of the value of the bank ' s assets have led to reasons for the credit organization ' s implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank until the time of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization under federal laws have been suspended.
AO AKB, GASTRUIBANK, is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ, on the insurance of natural persons' deposits in banks of the Russian Federation, is 100 per cent of the balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles per investor.
Payments, according to the Contribution Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the accounts, the AOC assets of GASSTRUIBANK as at 1 August 2016 took up 335 positions in the Russian Banking System.
A London schoolgirl who joined IGIL died in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join ISIS, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Counsel Tasim Akundji stated that her family had learned of her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she died of a Russian air strike in Rakka, a fenced group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
She was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this is to threaten others, that these are the risks involved in travelling to the war zone, to persuade people to make the same choice at any time,” said Akundji.
In February 2015, he and two other students from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and later on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Soultana family were told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid states that Clinton will remain loyal to Galand as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge if elected
The leader of the democracies in the Senate, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominated by Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected as President.
The republics of the Senate blocked Garland's allegation, and as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonine Skala.
Reid said at the conference- outside on Thursday that he predicts Clinton would choose Galand "with some degree of confidence."
Reid later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to come up with Gárland and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "untie the boat" with a new choice.
Galand is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who block the name of Galand were “priests” and “assistants” of the Republic's presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He stated that Trump was not suitable for the post.
Triats says that erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
Triats works with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of exposed celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for Men."
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to go back to showing an eternal and classic naked figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of women's bodies," said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a great work of art.
Models can present photographs online or in person at public castes in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow's gonna give us stories about bad internet shops.
In Moscow, we're going to release a monument that tells us how to avoid being a victim of an Internet shop.
This was reported in Roswan Superstar, M24.
It is reported that agency specialists are preparing a memory that will help citizens to choose the right Internet shop and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules of delivery of goods, and ways of protecting their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how the claim can be made correctly and so forth”, as described in Rosbybudsor.
The note is being finalized to date.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Rosbybudsor website in Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and to distribute a Moscow version.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of diversification in Crimea.
Persons from Ukrainian and Russian citizens who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them were Panov Eugenius Alexandrović and Zachty Andrey Romanović.
"They all give confessions," says the communication.
Earlier, a resident of Zapoena district, Evgenius Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, had confessed his guilt for interrogation.
FAS will fine Google for 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google of 438 million roubles, which is listed on the agency website.
The Google Antimonopoly fine was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will carry out our decision and pay the fine soon,” said Deputy Head of FAS Alexei Dozenko.
During the investigation, FAS found that Google provides smartphone manufacturers who are sold on Russian territory to the Google Player Application Store only if other applications of the corporation are installed on the device.
These include a search engine to be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the FM “On the protection of competition” (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that the enforcement of the order will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act needs to be respected by all companies whose products are shipped to the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including,” noted the Head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Department of FAS of Russia, Elena Zaeva.
It's suspected of conspiracy by 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book 50 days before my suicide.
The network of New Bookstores is fined for selling Stace Kramer's "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports Moscow City News Agency.
The book could be regarded as “encouraging or motivating the suicide behaviour of children and adolescents”, according to Rosnevizar, without specifying the amount of the fine.
The Ostakin District Court confirmed that there was a violation of the requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered a fine of 49 copies of print products arrested by the Rosbybudzor administration.
The source in the New Book confirmed that this was a Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookshops in Moscow were screened for a book “50 days before my suicide”.
There's going to be a memory night in Moscow for Ernest the Unknown.
There will be a memorial night in Moscow for the Sculptor Ernest the Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Letters House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in person in the United States.
It was therefore decided to arrange this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their own land," stated in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It noted that this was important to the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
At evening, close friends of the Unknown are invited, including poet Evgenius Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the Pushkin Ion Antonov GMI, director of the Russian culture, Mr. Mark Rosewski, and Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinski, Head of the Culture Department of Moscow, Alexander Kibowsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Platenikov.
Previously, it was reported that the relatives of Ernest the Unknown plan to hold a panniid in New York by 14 August.
The end-user was blaming: Who actually buys the plates?
Single men of middle years love to blame.
As long as you have not been able to break down a section of the commentary with gross insults under the pseudonym Nevesy-Medicals, this allegation is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the renaissance discussed is due, not to the bi-thousands boom that wants to enter a new material object, but to the nostalgia of middle years.
Those who recently bought a wine album with a high percentage of probability are between 45 and 54 years of age, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely to be.
It's also not just an act of collection by lovers -- it's emotional: older buyers are slightly more likely to have feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% against 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of a busy Soho street, in a modest grey suit, and in a violent gesture before the scene, laying hands and saying something exciting like, "Yeah, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops have now flooded buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several music stores with fantastic experts are still still in existence.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores, and I'm trying to estimate their age and emotional mood through observation.
Glasgow Stuart, 55 years old, followed by I went from Sister Ray (calculation: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculation: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for half a day to meet, and walk around stores to take hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These are the plates shown above (he sent me an e-mail photo, I did not chase him home), and they go through the walls of his living room.
Its reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly derived from his available income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford when he left and buy items he sold when he was young and small.
"Many of what I buy is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my fault.
Wez, a 25-year-old Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets match the profile of YouGov.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people affected by media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the duty to purchase their old plates.
Based on the conversations I have had, people have usually been rid of their collection in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their wine to buy CDs are now selling their compact discs to buy their plates,” he says.
This may explain the boom among the revivors of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, like Phonoica, to realize that plate shops offer comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wesa, some of the older clients are offended by the cash-free pay system.
Some wine lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to keep away from familiar envelopes for plates, objects that arouse memories of helpless youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling up voids or having material things as a kind of calm," says Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think many people have it.
It's a simple way to take your head off.
'We're like their social workers!' said a colleague from the glass shop.
An ICM survey in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought a wine album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a player they never used, whereas 7%, of those who bought the wine, did not have a player of the plates.
At this stage of the news report, I might have looked seriously puzzled, plumbing ceilings with the Bosanova collectors.
The "Tropheic" aspect of recovery is what Johnny, 42 years old, observed at Sounds of the University.
"Someone has come recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so we can put it in our own regiment,' he says.
It's not a lot of interest, but it's definitely happening.
More of the piece, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people who aren't older, they're a little under 20 who just get to know this.
Foop, who's now taking away almost the entire floor of wine, is a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70 ’ s who are photographed, adolescent boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores -- the latest synth and sex pop of Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, is trying through columns -- it's nice to see diversity in customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's difficult to find 30 seconds standing next to someone else.
Eleanora, 27, went through Fop for a few minutes, looking at the different plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much money, she says, so collecting plates isn't a good option.
It's expensive.
To listen to music on a computer or other device -- just but beauty was blamed -- is -- is to be absorbed into dreams with a spirit full of love.
I don't know how to explain it; it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers: urban fashionists.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at jeans-tangling shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls, every minute, gathering around a Polaroid cell, before their father and his daughter start talking about buying a Crossley player.
On the left is a ladder with plates for Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, compulsory plates for any average collection.
No one looks — perhaps because they are mere ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "fun."
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send several clients to the deep Soho for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
No wonder that a segment of a population that is more likely to have more time and money than most people have is a layer that spends most of its money on luxury goods, such as wine.
But as long as my findings show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plate shops, they do not rule out the existence of a large number of women collectors and wine lovers who exist in reality, in plate shops and online forums.
These people are probably all working in schools or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday by walking through the plate shops on Berwick Street, by pouring sheets and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who hangs over the shoulders of nothing unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland Polar Shark — The Longest Longest Bulb — Video Report
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the highest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record has placed a female between 272 and 512 years of age and five meters long
The French court rejected the proposal to demolish the shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the proposal of the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungli camp, where thousands of refugees live.
This week ' s court hearings held by the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to cut down a total of 72 home-made shops, where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to slow down or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple dishes for several euros in home-made restaurants.
The prefecture of Kale said that these places should be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian teams told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, stating that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide sufficient food for the growing size of the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free food for those in need.
Lille's court held that there was no legal basis for expelling the people who run 72 homemade shops, but stated that the problems of Kale prefecture “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-Fransua Molla said the baccals, cafes and restaurants played a far greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely fragile conditions."
He said that the space provided calm locations for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Child Café of the Junglei Camp, which works for no profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and counselling for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to Guardian said that his closing “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not over eight years of age”.
Two charitable institutions, Helping Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Fridays, estimated that the population of Jungle camp had grown and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest ever — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-district libraries invite young freelance to educational programs.

Britain stops on silver at Rygby 7, after the Fijian master class allows them to take gold.
The impressive British series in Rebie 7 was broken down by the Fiji team in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were totally destroyed 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has been given a ball master class, scaffolding, obstinacy, game support, line running and heavy power to win gold — its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too much comfort in the form of silver — Britain’s third in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Revolutionary on Ribby 7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated on their way.
Boks' painful beating, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier that day, could have returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But despite all of this, Fiji has been defeated in this form by a better team of 15 people.
This may be a comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Chief Traininger Fiji Ben Ryan, former British chief of Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the British.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on the Adlaide Seaves.
There's only one they lose.
These blows will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started brilliantly, for fun, reflecting British attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5 to 0 when Osea Kalinisau dived in the corner.
Four minutes at an hour Gerryr Tuway added another tachdown on the right flank that had been realized.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to intercept Mitchell prevented the man, Mount Leon Nakarawa, from killing a third one, but only delayed Fiji.
On the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more minutes... in the first half.
The Watmo Ravovo then broke through several more slow attempts to intercept Great Britain and storm the line to get a point.
Implementation resulted in 29-0 interruptions.
It seemed as if Fiji had been born to play rug 7 while Britain was still mastering the trade.
Which to a large extent is true.
Britain has been doing massive half-game replacements, and they have purchased a Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good according to the first half, until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain to make a tatdown in the left corner to account 36-7, but the game has long been on the way by South Sea Islanders whose fans were singing, waving their flags and dancing in stands.
Fiji’s approach was not to be admired.
Mother William adorned Fijian cake, which did not need to be adorned, with another attempt in recent seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on a lawn that was completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and Britain had slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense semi-final attempt at each — the difference in British realization.
Kyle Brown takes Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some wonderful work of his legs, broke the line and hit under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Markus Watson, brother 15 to the team of England, Anthony, won a victory — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning are inspired to win the dam against cancer
There won't be any more exciting gold in these games, and that's what he's talking about.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy peaks in history, Helen Glover and Heather Staning found added value to their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always while they were trying for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in British sports Annals who got to this height.
Their superiority was absolute, and eventually it was their 39th inevitable performance, again unprecedented.
What we're seeing is two brilliant athletes who slip over the surface with the elegance of the swan don't fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
After every gold dam, a battalion of ready-made hands contributing to the gradual increasing victory, which is of importance, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
That might have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your species a little for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in an inter-se zone, keeping the schedule at a minimum, if that could be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I had to go fast.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and was walking in the hospital — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they talked a few steps.
That's how it starts.
It's a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after winning, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Staning, the captain of an artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic for three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nobody, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning didn't lose any race in five years.
This pair gives a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Staning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't wait for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get out and get out and win this race, which we did.
It takes a year for a couple to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, her own TV adventure seeker, Steve Bexhol.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took London about six months to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the time frame for the destruction of authorized products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of food prohibited from entering Russia.
The order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on an official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russia sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban has since been lifted on several occasions and is in force until 31 December 2017.
Some agricultural products, raw materials and food are prohibited to Russia from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products have been banned.
The disposal of food imported to the country by way of embargoes has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from sale.
"Prohibition hunt"
On Friday, there are rains and storms in Moscow.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, causing rainfall and lowering air temperature.
The air will heat up to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] in the day.
For example, on the night of Saturday, Moscow will have short-term rains, possible storms and windstorms up to 15 m/s.
It is expected that between 12 and 17 m/s will rain with storms and wind blasts.
The rains are also projected in Orlovsky, Kurowsky and Voronesze regions, reporting “Dani.ru”.
Next week's downfall is unlikely.
The WTO Panel of Arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates are higher than those undertaken by Russia at the time of its accession to WTO.
“This is the first time that WTO took a decision against the Russian Federation”, says the communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their conclusion that the EU did not provide sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were “systematic” or “integrated”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is described in a report by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to welcome to the World Trade Organization Russia ' s actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is referred to in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that U.S. conduct in resolving disputes in WTO undermined the organization's principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members owing to the refusal of Americans to approve South Korean Judge Chan Seung Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not apply to WTO for Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The president's office was replaced by a leader.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia appointed Mr. Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has moved to the office of the President and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino, during the meeting, stated that he considered the anti-corruption work that had begun as Chief of Administration of President Ivanov to be important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, “Izveda” had written that experts considered that the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of Chief of Administration was transparent and understandable and that nothing would change the functioning of the Kremlin administration in principle.
They note that the head of the office, who had been in office for a long time, has been able to effectively build up the activities of the AR.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Weino, a man who was well acquainted with the specifics of the work.
In Poland it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish State Oil and Gas Company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years, the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unapproachable to it because of the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslav Majetz.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
"Maybe we won't buy gas at all," we're now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, CNG-terminal raw materials and Norway,” said Majetz.
Gazprom is now dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, a 30 per cent increase over 2015.
The share of Russian gas giants in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared with 40 per cent earlier.
We will recall that on 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Department did not agree to the establishment of a joint Gazprom company and its European gas pipeline partners, North Stream-2.
Poland's request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered through the “Northern Flow-2” had been left by Gazpromou a month earlier.
The Deputy President of the Holding Board, Alexander Medvedev, made this statement.
The “North Flow 2” auction will take place in 2017 and will take place in the fall of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action on the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, as stated by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the board of company.
He recalled that during the first quarter of this year, Poles only increased by 42 per cent the supply of gas from the Russian Federation.
Zamprem Gazprom added that the very fact that a Polish PGNIG application was filed with the Stockholm Court of Arbitration did not mean that negotiations had been terminated.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that Peter Naimsky, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gasprom contract for gas supply.
Poland's Gazprom contract was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimski, stated that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from east.
According to him, Warsaw planned to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas, Baltic Pipe, which would link the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The “North Flow-2” involves the construction of two filaments of a sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s Crimean border.
This was reported by the first head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
“I can confirm that the AMM has increased the number of observers in this field”, he said, in response to the relevant question of journalists, that he transmits “RIA Novosti”.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored three crossing points across the Russian-Ukraine border.
A video of a Kak-42 passenger aircraft landing at Ufa airport appeared in the network, flying outside the 400-metre runway and falling onto the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel '360'.
The CP occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of Krasavia came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, and there were no victims.
The aircraft itself was being transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is normally operated.
The Primorgian Investigation Department on the SCR transport was concerned with the causes of the heavy landing of a liner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but Stefan de Mistura, United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, considers that it has been indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which was due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on a toxic gas terrorist attack, suspected to be chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down on the eve of the day before, but that in Moscow the air had dropped bombs containing toxic substances, but those charges had been cited as an introduction.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the opposition group Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zki of having occurred.
Soon it became known that there were two toxic gas bombs.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the heat of my eyes, the difficulty of breathing," quotes the observer’s words.
At least 7 people died as a result of the attack, and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poisonous gas is confirmed by experts, acts will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists: “There is much evidence that this actually happened”.
The non-use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the daily shelling of its areas and the displacement of terrorists from the city.
As Reuters reports, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of three hours' imprisonment in the organization is considered “not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Jan Egeland, humanitarian adviser to Staffana de Mistura, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required each week to bring relief assistance and evacuation from the city.
“We have to ship bulk cargo from convoy trucks in areas where roads are practically destroyed and those that remain are mined,” Mr. Egeland said. “But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing struggle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place every day beginning on Thursday.
The establishment of a “humanitarian window” is intended to ensure that medicines, food and essential items are delivered to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to halt the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
A series of explosions at resorts in Thailand resulted in four deaths.
Immediately, several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack resulted in four deaths, 19 injuries.
The epicenter of the explosions came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four nationals and none of them Russians.
No terrorist group has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has rushed to state that Islamists are not involved.
Several persons have already been detained on suspicion of having organized the explosions.
Preliminary data from the local police indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks took place on popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
Following the arrival of the military Hutu in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
By 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over 2015.
The first suspects have already been detained in preparation for and organization of the attacks, as reported by Colonel Crisana Patanacharoen of the Police.
While it was too early to talk about objectives, he added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country “is certain that they are not associated with international extremist groups”.
Too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know for certain that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, they are actually local diversifications, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sykrit of Thailand.
The Thai Hutu considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the statements of Police General Sithić Srisocharoenrat, the bombs were bombed remotely within half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with restaurants for tourists.
It is well known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl who sold her food in the street.
The identity of the remaining victims is not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to data provided by the Royal Thai Police, four Germans, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and an Austrian citizen.
Russia is not among the victims of the explosions, according to the Russian press service.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the referendum held on 7 August, at which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution drafting commission appointed by the military Hutu.
Voters needed to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tried for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
We will recall that on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Commander of the country ' s army, Prauta Chan-Och.
That step, he said, had been prompted by the continued political crisis and by the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed the protestors and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok Ended Up in a state of Emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat in January 2014, announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces.
The special regime extended 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the victory monument in Bangkok, where one of the main protests took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown motorcycles.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
The development of conditions began in Suham Loga.
As noted by the “Early” report, the Government has been requested to harmonize the draft terms of the dry Lοgue gold auction with the continuation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed that companies with more than 25 per cent foreign nationals be excluded from the auction and those with no minimum capital of 25 per cent.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of pursuing a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August, and the auction could take place in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources introduced a draft order and auction conditions into the Government at the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Suja Log (Irkutsk region, stocks and resources 130 million universities), and described two sources of “sudden” familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening, specifying one of them.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project had been introduced into the Government.
A representative of Vice-Primorant Alexander Brownin, a non-polluting vice-preservator, said that the project had not yet been submitted to the officer's office.
“The auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and given the time limit for the gathering of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may be held in October”, said the Ministry of Nature.
According to the so-called “Sudden” data, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants described in the option, which was sent to the ministries and the FOVCs for harmonization in July (with “suddenly”).
The first is the existence of at least 25 per cent of the capital of the applicants.
The second is the denial of access to auctions for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on an understanding of FO-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already stated by the “Fear” on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may be excluded from the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as it is part of the federal subsoil (more than 50 tons of gold).
At the Ministry of Natural Resources, the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for State participation in the auction was made by the Irkutsk region, spoke in December 2015 by the “Bear” to the Ministry of Nature, and confirmed later by the Governor of the region, Sergei Lechenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, “to have agreed upon an investment agreement with Resteh”.
Those who lobbied for a restriction on the admission of aliens, the interlocutors don't specify.
“But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia's largest gold field against the background of Western sanctions”, says the interviewer, “Suddenly”, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, stated on 1 August that foreigners “may enter the consortium” if the applicants attract them “as financial entities, technological partners”.
The "Sudden" interlocutors are unlikely to adjust conditions in the government.
The industry's main applicant in Suja Lοgue is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO Poles, controlled by Suleiman Kerim Said's son, and Restach's son.
In July, partners created SP "SL Gold", where 51% of the shares of the Poles, 49% of the RT-GP structure.
In Röstheh, the comments were rejected, in Polsa, which “unquestionably, interest in the asset” and had all the competences and resources necessary for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of conditions”, added in the Pole.
The ARMRA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the Government of the Russian Federation has been made by sources called "Break".
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinros, who are developing assets in Chukotka, have been able to participate in the development of the High Logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the Head of the Union of Gold Manufacturers of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashouba, evaluated the “sudden” investment of $2.5 to $4 billion in dry Logh.
Most potential applicants are deterred not only by the amount of investment but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and technology for dealing with complex ores is required, explains industry interlocutors “suddenly”.
In the pension market, the largest M&A transaction, the “Kita Finance Administrator”, was launched by the four-controlled NPFs.
As a result, a NPF of some 373 billion roubles will be established on the basis of the Gas Fund.
The launch of the process for the consolidation of four pension funds, namely, KIT Finance, PromagroFund, Heritage and Gas Fund Pensions, yesterday informed the owner of 100 per cent of the KIT Finance Administrator funds.
“The reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-degradation of the terms of the contracts in force”, states the company's communication.
The association is based on the “Gasfund Pensions Fund”.
As the director of the NPF, Oleg Bjalosinski, notes, the pooling of funds has several challenges: expanding the geography of the presence, focusing resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the combination of the NPF, Gasfund Pensions will be the largest player in the GPS market.
As at 31 March, the pooled fund pension savings exceeded 373 billion roubles.
As can be seen from the accounts of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner's website, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are now Anatoly Gavrilenko (through GSS-controlled 65 per cent) and Gazfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched much later than the competitors.
For example, the O1-controlled NPF “Beautiful” has swallowed “Stalofond” since early this year.
The combined NPF is now joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
“Combining into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for structural tasks”, notes NPF CEO Nicolas Sidorov, “The future”.
The Safmar pension group - NPF “European”, “Education and Science” and “Regional Fund” have also been active since April.
The NPF Trust will join them in 2017.
“Consolidation of funds will have an impact on risk control, operational processes and expenditures”, noted in the Safmar pension group.
The delay in the pooling of funds, which was carried out by the “TI Finance Administrator”, may be caused by several reasons, indicate the experts.
Until recently, the NPF could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the Group ' s infrastructure bonds.
Following amendments to the CB Regulation in March this year, there are no such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, one major player can buy the whole issue," says Yuri Nogin, director of the AKRA financial institution rating group.
Several top-15 NPF managers on assets call another possible reason for pauses the separation of spheres of influence and, consequently, the human resources appointments in a single fund to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
The Gazfund NPF also did not respond to the request.
While the consolidation of funds is labour-intensive and cost-effective, it will be justified at a long distance.
As the director of the consulting company, Serguei Okolesnov, notes, the Gazunda Pension Fund has fewer outflows, accession will help stabilize the group's other foundations.
This will require more successful NPF 's "KIT Finance" and "Promaggorfund" experience in the production of SPS retails, as well as the use of more modern POs.
The requirements of the CB for NPF processes and personnel are increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, according to Paul Mitrofan, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings “Expert R”
“The effect of reducing duplicative functions will clearly cut off the possible costs of association”, Mr. Mitrophan noted.
The cost of pooling four of the Sergey Okolesnov funds is estimated at between 30 million and 50 million roubles.
“The cost of maintaining four such funds is about 400 million roubles per year, while consolidating the budget in the medium term is about to be reduced,” Mr. Okolanov is sure.
There's a good dysnieev movie called Pete and His Dragon in Russian rent.
New Zealand’s beautiful species, a sleazy dragon, a hearty story, and a cantial song are enough to believe in old - fashioned magic once again, according to ELENA KLOXUN.
The frightened child was picked up by a dragon who became a human child and a gentle babysitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, after a pup in the fairy tale book, plays with him in the back of his head and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, when he was abandoned and in a masterly bandage, he was no longer different from another deliberate forest sorganc, Maughli.
In this way, Pita finds her husband's red-haired female hero Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the Govin Brigadier (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively takes over the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of a dragon, but also help save it.
Pete goes through an accelerated course of “be human” in the community of idiotic Americans, who wear cowboy shirts, the moral code in the heart and smile blinder than any commercial.
No character looks and acts too terrible for the viewer to really hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who has opened up a hunt for an unpretentious resident of forests under his control, is far from being an incorrigible villain.
A huge bushy dragon has also been made with no fear at all, with a good facet of a bull’s bull’s face, a liner’s wings, and the ability to become invisible.
It's funny to hunt, it's squirting, it's even snorting, and fortunately doesn't say, but it's always trying to swallow, and it's very different from all the famous film dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of keeping up with such a high level of emotional involvement that, in the most stressful moments, the three hands begin to cry desperately, not only by the small audience, but also by the adults.
Amazingly, Oaks Figli, a young man, is acting as Pete, breaking between a possible family and a true friend.
And Robert Redford is rafflingly issuing a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to take off the fantastically cute remix of the forgotten Dedean film "Dramon Pita" of 1977, directly from his nose to the tip of his tail, remembered only by a mix of animation and play movies, and make him the most emotional film this summer?
Not unless the miracle helped.
In fact, Louri took only two things from his original painting: the orphan Pita and the dragon.
There were musical numbers and most of the weird jokes left behind.
This good story reads features taken from the Bamby, the Foreigner, and many other sweet hearts of children's minds.
Disney's studio continues to expand the gallery of high-quality belts of the twenty-first century.
Of course, Pete and the dragon are not as brilliant as the Book of the Jungle, and there's no skilled villain like Kate Blancett's as a stepmother in the new "Chicken."
But this naive film is no less successful in putting faith in miracles and good things in the best Sudanese traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, director Lowry, will be given again for the art filming story of Pieter Penet.
"Pie and His Dragon" by David Lowry and the scriptist Toby Halbrucks entered a new ambitious project about a non-adulterated boy on James Barry's one-name story.
Journalist RBC Alexander Socolov will be charged again
Counsel from the journalist RBC Alexander Socolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found fault with the defendant.
That the Public Prosecutor's Office made such a submission, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the issue of limiting access to the criminal case file, but the proceedings did not take place and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office.”
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had told the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the material collected were not compatible.
Investigators will now have to clear the gaps in the evidence base and bring new charges against Alexander Socolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CP) will appear in the case, or will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Mrs. Dince explains.
Alexander Soklov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the charge to the journalist RBC the phrase “distorting the political situation towards instability” and “deniation of power by illegal means”.
AlEXANDER ZILBERT lived in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian prefabricated house, had lunch in the local dining room, and then passed the WADA test.
I don't think life dies here for a second.
Even at night.
The latest ones sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another one and a half hours to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, the village is being settled and evicted, as some athletes are closing their speeches and leaving Brazil and some are only coming here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are being pulled by one of the temporary tenants.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues,” says the head of the Olympic team of Russia, Igor Kazikov.
It's hot water problems, so I'm sorry, toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, it's just that no one came to clean up.
Then the Kliners came in, but they just put some stuff on the floor, that's all.
They've got floors, you see, some innovation.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these fields are common!
In general, there's been a change in the clinical company and now all OK.
The Olympia village is South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountains, on the other side an impressive roar, and in places filled with water.
There is still a two-metre railway fence around the perimeter to be secure.
A total of up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in the village in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-story buildings is a huge Russian flag -- this house is completely devoted to the needs of our assembly.
By looking at the small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems appear to be most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the registration desk: "Please don't throw paper into the toilet" and "A gift of a badge."
The counter itself drowns in tracts.
Their cheerful bloom contrasts with the headings of the booklets: “Refuge on infectious diseases for those leaving Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid in drowning, taking a foreign body into the airway, losing consciousness - the stages of cardiovascular resuscitation”, “First aid in burns, heat, fractures and bleeding”.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not all are expected to have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a health centre located in Russia which is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance, including a relaxing and sporting massage, to the residents of the home.
It's our delegation's headquarters in front of the medical center.
Near the door is an inspiring poster, "No matter what, we'll win."
And, of course, poems:
All the arguments are totally wrong!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let the smaller ones, the sweeter the taste of victory, the Russian Federation will not retreat, nor will it break!
And for a greater lift of spirit, the announcement is, "Dear brothers and sisters!
Following the blessing of the Holy patriarch of Moscow and Rusi Kirilla’s entire spiritual care for the athletes of the Olympian assembly of Russia, Andrey Vladimirrovich Alexev is a protoire.
You can order the please and other demands by telephone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Celebrations for all faiths in the village.
And the Russians, they're in a privileged position, they've got their own crematory.
Because of the utilization of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the ladder recommended for use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled about the bodies that lay upon her.
They seemed to be sleeping female employees of a new clinical company.
I think at any moment they're ready to throw themselves at innovative genders, they've decided to set themselves up quietly on cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with an old acquaintance, Vitali Fedorich Dubco, a coach of ourbatutists who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his mother - in - law, Jan Paul’s champion of Europe, kindly agreed to show them their rooms.
There's nothing to complain about, and it's a well-deserved coach of Russia.
Sanuselle alone on four, but also wide.
The locker, of course, is funny, out of the cloth, there's no trust, but you can put things in.
"No, you're pretending they've finished their tea," she's handing out to Svetlan Kuznetsov, a tennis player I met in the main dining room.
The main name is at least because it is a space of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 servings on top of the mountain, completely free of charge.
Menu options are: "The Best of Brazil", "The World's kitchens", "Asia's Foods" and "Pitsa, pasta articles".
The latest version, I watched, is very popular with our volleyballists.
But let's say I didn't find soup in any of the units of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup?
I'm glad I took some Chinese with me, too.
And teapot.
But anyway, to make sure you understand, we've got even worse food on our courts.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearably homogeneous.
I personally chose a steam crack and a meatball in a tomato sauce.
A tablet containing its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the availability of allergens, is next to each dish.
Well, I'm sure it was a good idea to admit it.
I don't even know why it's worth it all the time at the local McDonald's.
Flexible, relaxed, you could say "dark" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
It's been faked by a Victorian trap that's won by a T-shirt.
Invoking, you can say!
To receive a gift, at least eight of the ten questions must be answered correctly.
I've got questions in Russian!
But I didn't attack him.
I mean, I got involved in a patriotic breakdown, of course.
The situation has been exacerbated by the second question: “If I have received notification of a doping control, should I go immediately to the doping control point?”
I'm talking about option B, "No, I've got one hour."
I lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA doesn't have to wait.
Anyway, we have to be right now.
In the seventh stage of Victoria, my situation became quite critical.
I thought, for some reason, that if I found it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and, by the way, hard to do!), I could use bio-hazards to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly denied in several proposals.
It's not fair playing this WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go, behind Ethmov, Isinbayev, and all our bloodthirsty team.
That's why I've focused on it, and I've won an unfortunate T-shirt out of my last effort.
Know ours, as they say!
In a winning mood, I was lost to the phytnes center of my neighborhood.
He's done the math of the coaches.
It hit 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete had ever been found in this threat to the raceway.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who doesn't know how to play!
And here's one of our guys sitting at the hospital next door.
In line for the eye specialist.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In the clinic, as in the whole village, where there is no spit, a condom - issuing machine is hung.
Thereupon, there is an encouraging call.
The only remaining is a spin of the iron that resembles the doorlock handle, and a condom made of Amazonian natural latex is ready to fall out of the apparatus.
I took myself alone to remember.
The athletes didn't wake up, they were taken by 450,000.
The Olympic village has an entire entertainment center for the celebration and observance.
In any case, there's a study tablet that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is filled with video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to those of video monitors.
I'm interested in a buddy in the form of a Ukrainian assembly that actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, I could just say I don't want to talk to a man in the form of a collected Russia, that's all.
Here, by the way, some strange pattern of circumstances in your eyes is being torn away from the yellow-blanched guys.
It's the most playful collection, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to reach every corner of the village.
But if you go, rather than drive, you'll get a Canadian pickup house at the entrance and a bathtub tent, a ticket office, a laundry office, a dry cleaner, a barber shop, a flower shop, a everyday shop, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can't wait for the Chinese philatelic turn), and a bank, and a found office, and a photokiosque.
And late in the evening, you ossives, sit by an olive tree decorated with multicolored tapes in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who have left the world.
And you're going to be under the accompaniment of a machine that indiscriminately sprays fluids to kill insects, to think of eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
The village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding its breath, Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that the news is that Inna Deriglazov won gold in a rapier at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first time.
Maybe I'm the only Muscovitch who saw it happen, except for those who, of course, watched Carioca competition that night.
It can only be understood by a real fan.
Imagine a dead Moscow night.
Neighbors from the bottom -- as always by the time of night -- wake up and start callously, but cry out very loudly at each other.
And threatening to move the furniture.
There's no time in the kitchen to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV schedule is unclear, so I was just controlling "Match," "First", and just in case "Russia" -- although it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repetitives, all the sports in there for some reason.
There are live TV shows.
Hope, of course, at "Match" -- all night a young man shouted in news releases first about the great semi-final Deriglazov--Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead basketball is U.S. -- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half ever won.
They put the U.S. obscenities in place.
As a result, they have lost, but as is now said, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all right, but there's a fight between Dee Franchiska and there's no change on the screen.
In the light panic, I'm starting to get through channels.
That's how it feels, the second time it's cool.
All right, let's go deep, to the cables.
There's no fencing on any of the "Kids" themes.
I feel like the fight is about to begin.
Text and Twitter broadcasts of some sports sites don't suit me.
Shipwreck produces unexpected but brilliant results.
The First website provides direct technical coverage of all competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on the fencing, I get a unit for gold.
It's perfectly counterattacked, it's going to go forward through the glasses, and it's clearly starting to stretch time.
The Italian's playing almost all the way out.
One point ahead, just over two seconds.
De Franchiska throws herself at Deriglazov, but she retreats, time ends, Italians pulverize.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Master on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
It turns out I'm the first person to see it with my eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the involved.
The Spiritual Authority of Muslims (MAM) of Tatar refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary ordered its imams to carry out Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars to "learn their mother tongue."
The Office states that this “does not in any way prejudice” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some Casani mosques, the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the population, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons at the Tatars won't reach the entire audience.
Yesterday, the plenary decided unanimously to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
As the Tutarstan Mufti Kamil Samigulin stated, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their mother tongue”.
"To those who say that it was too heavy, in every great mosque, we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language completely free," promised Mr. Samigullin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today, in all mosques, “should already be in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that DUM Tabarstan had published the magazine “Shura” with model sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who doesn't speak good Tatar enough, "can prepare for them thoroughly."
The Tatarstan DMA brings together more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Russian was used predominantly in a number of mosques in Kazani.
In particular, as the mufti indicated, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhamatchin stressed that the leadership aims to ensure that all students speak both national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no harm to the non-Tatar Muslims," said Mr. Muhamatshin, explaining that the sermon itself is "not compulsory, the main part of Namaz."
At the same time, oil will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will continue to be taught in mosques.
At the same time, Rafiq Muhamatshin said "suddenly" that there was no serious threat to the displacement of the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not known to be used in the sermons in the Republic.
The DGA decision was strongly supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress on Tatars (WCT).
The VCT executive head Rinat Zakirov said, "Macheti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to leave this area.
He noted that preaching is only in the Tatar language, “Imamas themselves”, but in the ExCom, the WCT “believes it to be correct”.
The imams interviewed who preached in Russian are ready to carry out the DUM decision, but they believe that the visitors will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both Tartars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they'll be bored.
"We have to renovate," says the imams of the Burnaev Mosque of Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer to even many Tartars because "in schools and children's homes, in radio, in the first place."
He believed, however, that the mosque would be able to continue its lessons and lectures in Russian on other days.
We trust in Allah.
Allah will bring forth the end of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60 percent of us don't speak Tatar.
They're Uzbeks, Tajiks, Azerbaijanis.
There are many foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we're four years old when we translated into Russian," Imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will be "to reach a smaller circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just the end of the preaching work will be different.
But time will tell.
"It's only easier for me, for instance, because the Tatar language is my native," he concluded.
Former Director of FSIN has been tried
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office has approved an indictment in the criminal case of the theft of the budget allocated to the Russian FSIN.
Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused over 2.7 billion roubles to FSIN, will be brought before the court.
The Capital Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskorskiy Paradise case against the former director of the Russian Federation FSIN, Alexander Reymer, his former deputy, Nicolai Krivopapov, as well as the Director of the PHOP, the “Information Technology Support and Liaison Centre of the Federal Enforcement Service” (FITF of CITOS), Victor Odjenov.
Depending on the role and extent of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of having been subjected to an offence by the Criminal Code in Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of official authority with grave consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (a fraud based on the use of their official position in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivavavov is charged under article 222 of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and possession of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the State treasury budgetary allocations from the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budget money, the team developed a scheme according to which the CITRO-controlled FIU enterprise, with which relevant government contracts were entered into, produced technical controls and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and carried out several times at prices overstated.
Despite the lack of production equipment, facilities, facilities and facilities for the establishment of a complete cycle of “electronic bracelets” between the CITRO FOG, five contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles have been concluded between it and the Russian FSIN.
As a result of this scheme, over 2 billion roubles were stolen in the accounts of the Samaritan branch of the FIU.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million roubles of cash were personally received by Mr. Reymer in his office from a co-counsel whose criminal case had been allocated to separate proceedings.
Nicholas Krivopapov, who had participated in the frauds, had found unknown ammunition from the gun, which had led to additional charges against him.
In the present case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN claimed compensation in the amount of rouble 2.7 billion roubles for the accused.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of being involved in traffic.
The Turkish authorities issued warrants for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two houses of his family.
From the east of the 1990s, the attacker Hakan Sukur is wanted by the authorities in connection with an attempted coup d'état last month.
Forvard, who graduated from his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to a “armed terrorist group”.
This is the Khismet movement, a society associated with a prominent Turkish religious figure and oppositioner, Fethhullah Gülen.
It was his President, Erdogan, who was the organizer of the military coup attempt on 15 July.
Fethhullah Guleen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media reports, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes belonging to a former football man's family.
According to the investigation, his father also joined the Fethullah Gülen organization other than Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his family were there.
Now he and his family live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated a gathering country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torno", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
True, none of them held more than one season.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective attacker in Turkey: 112 matches for the national team and 51 balls killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur resigned from his deputy post because of the initial corruption investigation around the Erdogan party and its immediate environment.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriet, arrest warrants for at least 42 journalists were issued in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of associating with an opposition Islamic preacher named Fethhullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media officers may wait for long prison terms, ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Eur Conchalowski wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would have created a network of cinemas only for Russian movies, which cost two to three times less than for foreign production films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for viewers with large needles of the Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 paintings in our country every year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they're very hard to compete with "Transformers" and "The Iron Man", which has huge budgets in progress," said the filmmaker.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russia Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers in creative professions and young professionals in various creative and humanitarian fields from across Russia and a number of neighbouring and far-reaching countries.
The British won Olympian gold in a two-way academic dam

Slim-Nives - The new gene company promises to surrender Zenit Arena by 26 December.
The new generator of the St. Petersburg stadium, which is due to host the 2017 Cup of Confederations and the 2018 World Cup, has promised to rent the arena by 26 December, reports RIA News, referring to the Head of the Provisional Commission of the Council of the Federation Peace Cup 2018 Vadima Tulipanov.
"We visited the building with the Minister of Sport of Russia today, Vitali Mutko, with us the director of the Metrostroa, Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd give up the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious Petersburg company, and it never breaks time.
Vitalia Mutko and I remained happy to see and hear," quotes the interviewer's agency.
Vitaly Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the location of the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Also, Mr. Tulipanov noted that his commission, Sufed, would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and visit the construction regularly.
Remember, yesterday, it became known that Metrostra would complete Zenit Arena, the contract would cost about 5.4 billion roubles, and the same company won a bid to improve the area around the stadium, the contract cost 2.4 billion roubles.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Míassa, Chile, counsel from former Vice-President Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulić is detained.
Another accused lawyer, Sergey Kolosowski, reported that Constantine Akulić had been summoned to the SCR Miass's investigation department today to charge one year's history of beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulic travelled to the scene of an accident as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally initiated against unknown persons, and now that he started to defend Nicholas Sandakov, it was found to be Akulik," he said.
Constantine Akulic became a lawyer for the deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer was summoned to the Miassah SCR, the defence party was informed that Monday was due to expire the filing of the fraud case in which Nicholas Sandakov was accused.
Remember, there are two criminal cases against Nicolaus Sandakov.
Under the first (fraud) case, he was inducted with a promise of 1.5 million roubles to facilitate the appointment of the Chief of Administration, Lake Eignia Tarasov, as Mayor of Magnitogorka.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nicolai Sandakkov allegedly received from the Director of Pyton, Igor Kalugin, in the amount of no less than 1.3 million roubles, from the Director of Pyton.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in the paper "The Former Vice-Governor Demands a Consolidation".
The Russian copper company (CPC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the modernization of one of the country's oldest and ecologically “pollutant” enterprises, the Karabasa mediated combination.
The Carabas media plant was founded by an English equity company headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
During Soviet times, this was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually ensured the life of the whole city.
In the 1990s, however, due to financial problems, production was stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
A decision was taken in 1998 to resume the work of the Karabash Medavitating Joint.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash had already been notoriously known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabassmeda began to change in 2004 after the enterprise took over the Russian copper company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced environmental pressures on the environment.
This was noted recently by the Governor of Chelabin province, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabassmedi in the early days of July.
The head of Southern Urala described the enormous changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Karabasmedj had moved to the RKKK group.
The main upgrading activity of Carabassmeda in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid shop that captures up to 99.9% of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company, All-Wover Levin, investments in the project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the KPA, Karabasmedy, is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, caps and a gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new industrial run-off facility worth 1 billion roubles at the end of 2016.
In turn, taxes to the city of Karabash will also be increased.
During the entire period of implementation of the Tomina GOC project, from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of Release II, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
After the introduction of HOC, taxes can reach 80.9 billion roubles at all levels.
During the year of production in Varen region, 346.3 million roubles are budgeted for at different levels.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the enterprise works, the more contributions it can make," Valery Ulanowski added.
In the RPC, it was specified that tax contributions from Mikheev GOC had approached 1 billion roubles in 2015.
However, the participation of CRP enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax contributions.
The CRP enterprises assist in the repair and maintenance of schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and the improvement of the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabash was major repairs and, in fact, almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten for 95 children.
The building built in 1960 was in emergency condition.
There will also be a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and ground-based parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
Aren's RCM will allow for visible professional sporting events at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical and sports activities comfortable for the people of Chelabinsk, especially children.

Messengers and postal services owners must identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the short content of a draft law developed by the Media Communication Union (ICU), which unites the largest Russian communication operators (i.e., “Knowledges”).
The staff of the three member companies of the Union confirmed that such a project was under discussion.

WSJ: The US is considering the imposition of sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the break-up of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the incursion of the Democratic Party's servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
It is reported that, in order to impose sanctions, U.S. President Barack Obama will have to formally accuse the Russian server or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States intelligence services are almost convinced of Russia ' s involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name hacker attackers.
The exception is the break-up of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, which was officially responsible for the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying sanctions against those who implement or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The sanctions decision process can be lengthy, writes the publication.
Even if officials concluded that hackers had acted with Russian support, they would have to weigh possible consequences before deciding on disclosure.
They have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it exacerbates tensions in bilateral relations.
It had previously been reported that Barack Obama ' s administration allowed sanctions to be imposed against the State whose hackers had broken the servers of the Democratic Party ' s Nazis.
The website of WikiLeaks published an e-mail to the National Committee of Democratics.
The media reported that hackers working with Russian authorities could be involved in the hackers.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google for almost half a billion roubles
Competition in the mobile application market was the reason.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at Yandex's initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to the Android components under conditions that prohibited pre-installing applications from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company had abused its dominant position on the market and had imposed installation along with Google Play other applications on mobile manufacturers.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google by reporting back to FAS leader Alexei Dozenko.
The fine shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition protection law.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then determine what to do: do it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in violation of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that contracts be adjusted before 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, the possibility of a world agreement was discussed with Google.
The measure will not lead to anything.
The leading analyst, Mobile Research group Eldar Murtazin, expressed this opinion by Echo Moscow.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no effect on both the users and the competitiveness of the corporation.

The effect of "Anime" Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon on Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by animating, but some commentators say it's racially inaccurate.
With the "Lense" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individual ways that are bound to be absurd.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or a character to stand up to Roy Liechtenstein.
Lins are rough, warped instruments that produce more than 30 million corrected selves a day.
Any mistakes quickly become well - known.
The Snapchat Lins were criticized in the past when they were accused of being advertised by the application of the dark skin of the face or of encouraging whites as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week offered a lens that gave them indirect eyes, crooked teeth and fluffy cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon on Asians — yellows.
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions indicated the more serious diversity problem of the company.
The following day, reports and subsequent complaints were distributed on The Verge and Motorboard, the day after the Snapchat announced that they had removed this function.
The company commented that the lens was meant to be anime to the characters, not an Asian cartoon.
But the experts who know about racism were not quick to recall the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said that the lens was “sinful and at least awkward”.
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very rough cartoon on the Asian side and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow but highly degrading to yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from the corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the davis that we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lens creates an image that offends the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Cathy Jo, “it's much more difficult to remain unnoticed than it used to be”.
On Thursday, Joo, a product manager and engineer working at Medium, decided to delete her records in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were a cause of insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Jo was mostly criticized by the white management of the company, which was composed of only men and concluded its article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Joo, who is an American Chinese national herself, wrote: “They did not have enough nonwhite people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they do not hold positions in which they can speak safely and openly.”
Other commentators share her view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to the attorney, the company had recently hired a Raccer to focus on underrepresented sections of the population and to actively attempt to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Jo said that she would keep her Snapchat records closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that they won't."
Military leadership distorted intelligence about IGIL, reporting to Congress Commission
Officials from the U.S. Central Command changed intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as well as the reasons for the events on the ground, reported to the Congress Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican Chairpersons of the Committee of the House of Representatives for Inland Affairs, the Committee for Intelligence and the Sub-Committee on Military Appropriations has found a “wide-ranging complaint” among Central Command Intelligence Analysts, who claim that the leaders have subjected their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military authority in Tampa, Florida, which controls United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by Centcom's superior command generally gave a more optimistic picture of United States anti-terrorism actions than the real data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services," said a news release devoted to the report.
“What happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the senior management seems to have failed, our military is suffering,” said Ken Calvert, a member of the House of Representatives, a Republic of California.
Management problems in Centcoma reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report detailed the shortcomings that have constantly arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi Armed Forces provided by the Central Command.
While he does not provide definitive evidence that Obama's administration had ordered the falsification of reports, he argues that analysts felt that Centcom's leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the Islamic State's threat, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
" During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command of Congress were much more optimistic than actual events," reported.
For example, official Centcoma publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at Mosul's return could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq ' s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certainly known," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence authority of the U.S. Central Command falsified command documents to minimize the threat posed by IHIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that the analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow, based on the Thursday report.
An additional, pending investigation into Centcoma intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party to the Intelligence Committee of the United States House of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions of the republican operational group.
“To date 2014 and 2015, Centcom established an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments relating to IHIL and the Iraqi Security Forces”, claims in a statement by Adam B. Shiff, a member of the House of Representatives, as chief representative of the democratic party to the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, “reserved intelligence documents”, has damaged the moral condition of analysts and has “not sufficiently reflected differing views”.
But Shiff and the democracies claim to have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to put their conclusions under “suffered or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress ' s investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, opened after complaints by Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, the representative of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress's report while the Chief Inspector's investigation was ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of integrated data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the United States bombing in Iraq and Syria (as increasingly claimed by the Ministry of Defence) has achieved its objectives.
But last year's statements make it doubtful whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State repeats more than a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration, because of many of the analysts' protests, had expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
The Huker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence workers in the Islamic State.
In the past year, according to officials, the Huker team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on oil mines belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil refineries to sell oil in the black market.
But discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, reports the Times of September.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after testimony at the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic in the assessment of war.
General Ostin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command, Gen. Joseph L. Wowell.
The U.S. winners four consecutive times in women's hockeys on grass, thus approaching a decisive match with Britain
Killing once three needles in the match, which ended with victory over Japan at account 6-1, Cathy Baem opened the account on Thursday the first two-foot U.S. women's hockey team on grass, when Americans won over India's team with an account of 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Baem, 27 years old, says she's not sure if she'd ever done something like that.
"I won't mind," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who's been tracking their own nudes.
That's what she knows: the American account is 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unconquered after the Japanese lose on Thursday 2-0.
British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday at the last game of tour 1.
Both teams claim a quarter of the final, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their team of six and who will take the second place.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little bit of weather when the fourth-final game begins.
However, the Saturday game shows that Americans have made noise in their surprise series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London.
Bahm was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, took a hockey stick on her grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel) and joined a national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't pass the final selection tour.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong with her and her teammates.
Next year Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed trainer, and everything started to change.
"A cultural change, a psychological change, a change in physical training," said Baem.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity that we now have.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bahm opened an account in the first half of a game of brocade with uncomfortable hands at a short distance.
India had reached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team had shown itself to be surprised by the rigidity and kept the account 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long passage with a ball down on the left side of the field, then the spiral entered the middle, and pushed the ball into the gate, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The drying victory was the first time at the U.S. altar tour to see Jackie Briggs, who was missing one single goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in a blow.
So did Bahm.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the result of Saturday's play.
In the context of the Olympic Games' obsolescence - “den” of the Battute jumps
Wherever you are, however much time now, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be constant and inevitable, a perfect combination of competition and desire.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's that burning torch that passes from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in line at the cafe, or hear about Simon Byles, Cathy Ledekes, or about the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
There's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who plays the Olympic Games for the first time, could well be among the famous ones shown in prime-time sponsored and life-promoting ads if he was a swimmer, a gymnasium or even a fettalist.
But a 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in Olympic contests on Battuth jumps.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Further away from the centre, partly in the shadows, are sports that are not universally recognized: pneumatic gun fire, bow fire, badminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak out to defend my personal passion, please let me draw your attention to the modest charm of the baltuette jumps.
Although the Battuth jumps have been the Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many people I interviewed did not know that they are generally Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won the medals in the batuette jumps, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian tend to share male awards and Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dun Dun of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the bartenders have an outsider balloon, especially because for an unenlightened ear, they are associated with a circus college rather than with the Olympics.
I must admit here that I am not an expert, but only a land enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential — a caricature of endless leaps — but also a beauty of gymnasium and jumps into water, two kinds of sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolian", meaning "tramplin for jumps into water".
The winners jump on a giant Battute, which takes up to 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobat tricks (turns, folds and salads) before finally landing on their feet.
They are assessed on compliance, complexity and time-of-flight, according to the official Olympics Programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is to move forward.
The applicants for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes towards the finish, and sometimes back and forth, all over the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start-up wall, but also, in view of the TV camera, another nagging point: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, commendable, even fanatical, and enough to make even the spectator slip.
But I think it's a little tired of watching the Games.
It gives you a break.
Battuist direction up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she leaps, seems like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then with no effort up again.
And of course, they are not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program there is no foolish zeal for the finish, no leaps in length, only the strange, luxuriant disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest day-to-day Olympic sport.
Women's qualification competitions, and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at the hour of the day for Eastern European time; men's on Saturdays, also on an hour.
NBC will broadcast the final of the day program from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if consciousness can only be raised by putting male athletes in high spirits and objectivity — as Wall Street Journal recently suggested — Dooley is just waiting for his new admired band of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Rising Protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
During the past week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was harsh.
Witnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Video recordings from protest sites allegedly taken at the end of the past or earlier this year show security officers beating young people with sticks when they were handcuffed against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country of Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly — even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia had hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations had consistently mentioned government repression — opposition in the territory of the State had been suppressed by the fact that dissidents had been silenced.
Many of them have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no alternative but to protest, the rebellion will rise”, said Seyoum Teshome, lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are many complaints, ranging from land use, resulting in the takeover of government coalition power.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government Party and its allies have totally outstripped the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the Eritrea border are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and rearming.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings, which have been boiling deep in the soul for several years, are now flashing.
First, it would seem quite harmless: smartphones.
In just the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services have become better.
Even when the Government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through the proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves to protest.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara, a predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, flourished in politics and business in the exploitation of Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under a single beginning," said Mulata Hemech, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests were held in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that the Tigray ethnic group, which represents about 6 per cent of the population, is unfairly dominated by Ethiopia and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
A third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have anticipated danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly adept at recognizing the first signs of discontent and using intelligence to obtain data and clear up opposers.
“The current regime lacks common sense”, Abdi said, an analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalén, appeared nowhere and took up Melesa.
Unlike Melesus, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a South African.
Analysts say he doesn't have the trust of security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will lead to further bloodshed.
Ethiopia had experienced such unrest most recently in 2005, after thousands of people had protested what analysts said seemed to be elections that had been blocked by the Government and then falsified.
In the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in recent months, and the period of unrest was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed their appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-reaching development of infrastructure, such as a new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal frustration of the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondara, the city of Amhar, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises, and the anti-Tigra hate in social media is becoming comprehensive.
The analysts claim that the United States and other Western Allies are in trouble.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it was clear that the West wanted to support democracy, but on the other hand, he did not want his ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it's hard to get through this tight rope," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IHIL was founded by Obama, "the sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict that covered his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he stated several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of a terrorist group by the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the President of the Republican Party to speak wisely to the American people.
It also put his deputies who tried to protect him during a period of unrest into a awkward situation, since they had to explain what he probably did not mean.
After expressing this assumption at the meeting on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded IGIL.
But on Twitter early Friday morning Trump wrote what he was doing.
This post was the direct opposite of the statement made just one day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his charge.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump mitigate the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the Republican party's presidential candidate did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to shift his campaign to the economy in the face of a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton were competing about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday Trump tried again to get back to the topic.
Once again, when he called on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and said that he had considered her speech boring.
The Trump has used it as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had come under general criticism, practically expressing the idea that Russian should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm joking."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permitted in political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
“I think it's his way of testing certain messages that are responsive to his fans to see how they work and then to `explain' them in one way or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who conducted an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of mitigating statements for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even brighter tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump was giving up Clinton, with a high weight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and going with her in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpretation of his words and of misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have made his loyal allies uncomfortable: they have to support him publicly, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Juliani, a former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputies of Trump, made a serious effort to protect the candidate for the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
'I think what he says is acceptable political comment,' said Juliani when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama IGIL was almost unknown, he called it a non-hazardous, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he took forces out of Iraq.
Most middle-statistical Republicans believe that Obama's administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed IHIL to develop because it was unable to deal with the situation in the Middle East in a harsh manner.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for undermining each of his words and prejudices against him.
He made fun of the poor TV experts who were trying to figure it out and said, "They're weak."
Some democracies ridiculed Trump's justifications as a further proof that he was not fit for president.
Once an outcast coffee shop is coming back to Greenpoint.
Webber's coffee shop was a mess, only a cash spot in Williamsburg, where there wasn't Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Cherie's shop, which took up Vverb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in an up-to-date city.
"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The restored Vreb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
There's Wi-Fi in the new Verbe, and they take credit cards, but there's some of the same employees and a similar kind of simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The new "Verb" is headed by Sisco Rodriguez, an old coffee shop official who is the owner and general manager in a new place.
He started working at the Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left much behind.
Vreb works with the same bail distributor and buys the same model of coffee machine.
It's even equipped with age-old camel mirrors.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered us new dishes.
The menu presents bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and contains cappers or roasted bow topping.
There's a dish of brown rice.
No more beer in the coffee shop, but now fresh juices are made.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the steady flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former clients have also been pushed out of Williamsberg," he shared.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Olivier was one of such clients.
Olivera, 34 years old, had lived in Williamsberg and had often visited the Vrebs.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still in there.
After closing "Verb," she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was coffee and the atmosphere that improvised me in the Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, though that day instead of the usual ice coffee she ordered purchased tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been devoted to "Verb" since 2003.
He would come in front of his job and order the same thing.
"In fifteen minutes of eight, every day, as sometimes, I came in, and for me, I was prepared my butter bag and all the stuff," he said.
Rodriguez reported that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but he changes things with bacon, egg, or cheese on the bail with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap store once took over the old place.
Moreover, Soup Cherie's owners offered to make special soap for Verba, using coffee from a cold coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree with their proposal," said Rodriguez.
Permanent residents of the Greenpoints of Polish origin also loved the coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in a window so that his new neighbors would feel wanted.
The new place has other benefits.
A local point for the sale of juices plans to spill bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that a coffee shop will join a nearby building.
For many clients, it's enough that a new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and said he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new location, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he were coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this smell," he confessed.
Depressant food for depression in the "Platonic Passe"
In March 1933, shortly after his assumption of office as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable fifth Avenue dishes, for example, the fua-gra and the Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: porcupine eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes, and black - oil desserts.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cough, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
The last book of Coua, "Ragu in Chinese", was dedicated to Chinese kitchen in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a winter apartment in Lower East Side via food in her book House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new joint work called "Platonic Passe", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
As they showed some of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Chop, a tiny, simple snack in the Flotyron Quarter, which has been operating since 1929, the year of Birge Bank.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a plumbing cheese and a olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took an turkey, potatoes and vegetables mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple thought it was an appropriate starting point for discussion of food in the period of depression.
"Roulettes were in great demand," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made out of the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be spread out.
Imagine you ate as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Who's gone crazy.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
During the years leading up to depression, the U.S. table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared for male farm workers, and freshly cooked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The “Fedy Passage” describes how the country was able to cope with the fact that suddenly it was no longer a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," said Cau, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and bakeries, became basic foods; bakery was “a beautiful way to dispose of food, ” said Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide non-applicable ingredients under a dense layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry products.
The meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economical distribution of luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
In researching a book that includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish for the era: a baked bow with peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was not successful," said Coe.
Ziegelman added, "It was very strange."
Arahis oil does not fit the burning bow at all.
This was typical of many household prescriptions.
More than ever since then, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
When publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to accept the challenge and transform the teddy of protein spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Flat tablet" is a playful of curious historical facts.
It's particularly pictorial about the Government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's position in the spirit of "let him eat pies."
Publicly proud of the simple farm line of Iowa at the time of his childhood, he was fed as a sophisticated millionaire.
"He liked a continental kitchen, like a fish with a cucumber sauce," Coe explained.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book says, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninterested with taste, and this led to the White House being “not only used the most disheartening food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgusting food ever prepared”.
Many of the cooking habits of the depression were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Ziegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
Spouses tell us that at the time of writing, they were better able to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother — that she could not throw food away, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," said Cau.
Ziegelman recalls, "She's totally poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case of profilers.
When the plates in Eisenberg's deserts, they and Coe got dessert, which they made at home: a black-skill dessert, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a brunch mousse," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes broccine names.
There were no plums that had been beaten, but the nuns, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to throw a spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
To my surprise, it was not bad.
Koe asked for supplements twice.
He said to his wife, "A few roubles of Greek nuts would not interfere with this."
Arrest of members of the mass fight case at the Khovan cemetery extended until 14 November
The court left the case of mass fighting at the Khovan cemetery until 14 November, granting the request for investigation.
In the case of accused persons, 14 persons are involved.
We will recall that on 14 May, several hundred Central Asians and the North Caucasus killed three people in the Khovan cemetery.
Former leader of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and co-founder of the Health Nation Public Organization, Alexandre Bocharnikov, are charged with organizing the murder.
The question of the second indexing of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Golodec, reported on his visit to the Bryan region.
We have specific parameters for how much the pension needs to be increased in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are going to sum up the outcome of the half-year, and we'll finish this work within the next two or three weeks,” quotes The Hotel Interfax.
Commenting on the six-year-old scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Kudrina, the vice-premier reported that the topic was not addressed in the cabin.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexing of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigorian went to the final competition for small-caliber rifle fire.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigorian went to the finals of a small-caliber rifle from the position of the Olympics in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky won 629 points and took the first place is the new Olympic record.
Kirill Grigorian became the second - 628.9 wasl.
Eight of the top athletes went to the final.
Kamensky is the world recorder of this discipline (633).
The Turkish oppositioner Fethullah Gülen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état," quoted Gülen as the French newspaper Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish opposition stated that “if any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey”.
However, Gülen strongly denies involvement in the coup d ' état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court of Justice had previously arrested an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethhullah Gülen.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Glad will recover legal fees during the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Glad Science Inc has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal services incurred in relation to the claim for a hepatitis C patent with Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, which was decided by the Federal District Judge.
In June, Gilad was released from payment of $200 million for breach of Merck ' s two patents related to Gilead ' s medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including swearing and other non-ethical acts.
On Thursday, the U.S. federal district court judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilad was entitled to compensation for the costs incurred in contesting the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilad, who dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilad and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which was the basis of the Sophos-Boyer, the active ingredient of the Gilead drugs.
U.S.-supported Armed Forces claim to have intercepted full control over Manbij from the Islamic State
The U.S.-supported armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbidge near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a representative of the group informed the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the departure of the remaining militia group who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, informing Reuters Charfan Darwish of the Allied Military Council of Manbij.
"The city is now under our full control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax declarations on Friday, which showed that the democratic party candidate and her husband had $10.75 million of income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in honorary fees, and former Secretary of State declared $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, together with his wife Anna Holton, has issued tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency”, said the adviser to the pre-election headquarters of Clinton Jennifer Palmieri.
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violating his past promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is a common case for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the check of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
“ Your move, ” wrote a Twitter adviser to the election staff of Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the democratic party candidate’s declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks were complete.
Trump's critics, including Mitta Romney, President of the Republican Party in 2012, and other republican congregations, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton took hold of this issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on the distinguished Republicans, who persuaded Trump to make public tax reporting.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the Michigan economic talk.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception a presidential candidate for decades: to publish his tax declarations," she said to the gathering.
Politico reported that Trump had paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday as saying that they might still be doing so.
Federal tax rates became the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska State, Buffett, whose conglomerate Burkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under IRS verification, and that Trump was "feared" not by tax collection agencies, but by voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations up to 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Klinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, salaries were the source of $100 from their income alone.
Their main investment was a low-cost index food stock, and Clinton announced dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Cheli powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzanian environmental fighters use an innovative way to prevent elephants from entering human settlements — by throwing in them condoms filled with powdered Chile.
The method proved to be effective, and Honygiede Foundation, which had been given the head of this idea a few years ago, and together with the American Committee for Nature Protection, took over its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use non-violent, four-step measures to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many used to use cops to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have invented a set of tools ..., we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, as a result of which they are much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without causing harm to elephants," said Honygiede Damian Bell, executive director.
The first two steps are the burning of the torch in front of the breaking elephant and the signaling of the horn.
If he can't be driven away, they drop the so-called cloud of chili.
A chili powder mixed with soil is placed in a condom with a boy, and the end of it is clasped, and only a phytil is left outside.
When incinerated, the condom bursts with a groove, spilling small dust of powder into the air.
One thought is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launch device that shoots Roman candles into the air by producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey after an attempted coup attempt in July of this year.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu, interviewed local journalists.
In the first phase, we called off 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
We will recall that a coup attempt was made in Turkey in July.
The authorities officially declared that the coup d ' état had failed, as well as the detention of over 6,000 persons, including senior and middle-level military personnel.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people were killed as a result of an attempted coup d ' état.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israeli telephone code from the Arabs — reported RT News
A French director of Jewish origin had launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not appear on the Israeli telephone code list, with officials referring to “requests” by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of a documentary about the Holocaust "The Shoa", expressed his displeasure at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the Lanceman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which it could call directly from the room.
How could it happen that Israel was expelled and destroyed in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
He wrote a Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In an effort to explain the matter, the director raised the issue on the hotel desk.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, was "sucking him."
Klerk the hotel said that the measure was "a deliberate decision of the Kempinski hotel network management."
The reason behind this step was further anger from the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demand that Israel's code be removed," said Lanzman, who serves as a hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadass-Handelsman, described the case as “a fearful disgrace, ” reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany, and that's what's happening in this hotel network, is even more embarrassing.
I don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the officer said.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "revealed" with alleged Arab clients' demands.
"We'd be ashamed," said another post, saying that a hotel located on the famous street of Kurfurstendam is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened any charges, calling the incident “an oversight” and “apologizing” in front of the Lanzman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list," quotes the representative of the Hotel Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
The police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
The students met the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protestors.
The riots began when the police tried to disentangle the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo, Heraldo Alkkmin, almost 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protestors could be seen writing on the walls of the graffiti against the provisional Acting President, Michael Thamer.
This last protest occurred just a few days after the protestors went out into the streets to support President Dilma Rusef, who had been dismissed, when the Senate voted for her impeachment.
Russian-Islamic trade increased by 71%, reports RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Ambassador Lewan Jagaryan of Russia to Iran.
As international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there was a growing interest by Russian firms in the conduct of business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies resume contact with Iran and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, Russian-Iran trade increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground-based vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries for the first time by the number of visitors to Russia.
It can be said with confidence that last year’s record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend that I visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yedz, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition,” he said.
The State continues to entrap the defense and industry complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the director of the Almaz-Antay brand, the “loss of work” and the “lost of trust”.
Hennadiy Bendersky has been appointed Head of NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov was not available until Thursday evening, and did not create widespread media coverage.
How can such silence be explained in the face of the military’s extensive rearmament?
It is likely that the management of the Russian Federation does not wish to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This confirms once again that the defence and industry complex (OPC) has many problems and that the State does not wish to attract social attention to them.
The removal of Nestrodov is certainly an important development in terms of industrial order.
The NGO “Almaz” is the main concern of the concern of the mining industry, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems (MANCs).
At present, Almas is working to establish the “Poliment Reeded” and “Morfei”, which are planned for new corvettes, frigates, esminists and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitri Korneev, believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is due to the disruption of the time frame for these projects.
This version is most logical.
For example, the “Morpheus” was under development as early as 2007 and was expected to be implemented in 2013.
"Poliment Reduth" should become the main air defence system on the latest VHF ships.
According to the information I receive, in a few years of testing, no truly successful test has been performed.
True, as far as I can tell, there is no clear fault with "Almaz," said Corneve.
The expert fears that the delay in the entry into service may also occur with the “C-500” FARDC.
The project development and development work has not yet been completed, but the first sets should be deployed in 2016.
The Ministry of Defence is satisfied that “the work is planned and will be completed within the established time frame”, although in 2014 the agency recognized problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been led by Almasa since 2011.
Corneev noted that delays in project time could be both a cause and cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become very difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PPC and plans for the management of enterprises.
The industry received long - term orders for tens of billions of roubles, and large sums of money are known to love silence.
In general, the directors of the defence companies are removed from their posts of their own choosing, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to other work.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the leader of Almasa may have been a figure of strutsy and resisted the "distinguished" from above.
It seems that the State will no longer tolerate such conduct.
By the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence and fail to carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the incoming managers (maching at the Zweda shipyard).
The President is personally giving greater attention to the sector.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industrialization Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the PPC managers in an effort to have a loyal board of directors at their disposal, who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but against the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the CPOs, there are no other instruments available to the State.
The prevailing defence situation is certainly not disastrous, but the current geopolitical environment stimulates the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the PKK, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with Sergey Shoiga, Minister of Defence.
The President seems to have adopted a famous saying, "You want peace - prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked quite well.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved that.
The glamour of “conquerers” in the cold war ultimately led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world”, there may be no safe corner left.
Despite the general distress, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
Increased military power will enable Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to move to new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Kallom Skinner running down the finish line, bringing British bike gold
Scotsman Kallom Skinner was running towards a triumph in a male command spire on a bicycle in Rio last night, as a result of which command trio of Great Britain defended its title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow was the most powerful man his Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by running down the finish line to win the victory of a portite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed an unexpected victory four years ago by winning when Hoy declared his fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they were done modestly on the March World Championships in London, even though Hoi had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a member of Jamie Stuff.
They did just as they did at the time the Hands showed up.
Hoi's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man supported by British coaches, seeing potential in Scotland now being realized.
Hindez, Kenny, the championships of Hoi four years ago, and Skinner established an Olympic record of qualifications, but the standards were surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindez was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindez was on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, the Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoi observed from his seat as invited expert BBC and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez as they entered the pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flat comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and won the championships of the world.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, together with Kenny and Hoi, Hindez admitted to fall on track after a failed start.
He later retracted the comment, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hindez said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags at the rostrum."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We've been losing so many races with the world name that winning the Olympics has been amazing again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of 10 race names in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the past five months, five more successful days are expected.
With the form shown by Kenny, it's not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeated Hoi's exploits by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would allow us to see Kenny — born exactly 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on 23 March (which seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgraywa, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister — brings his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
That would be like Hoi's.
The next time, Kenny competes in a syringe, which starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindez said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he has to get a knight."
It was the only day of playing medals, but there was next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Whiggins, Ed Clancey, Stephen Burke and Owen Dooll are the fastest four-kilometre team race.
They finish at 3:51.943.
The world record of gold winning in London 2012 is 3,51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday on the eve of a qualification visit, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In a corresponding women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Cathy Archibald of Milngavi improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The British Command has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the average period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
Following in fact exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas on the second, not least, exit from the post of Technical Director, Shan Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and withdrawals of large figures, such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first night race on the bicycle, it seems that the legendary British glory of reaching the summit at the right time may be repeated again.
The future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Victorian Portuguese aluminium plant — as well as of hundreds of workers — is under threat because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one factory owner, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all contracts of supply will be terminated.
This step is a consequence of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A fixed subsidy ends in November for 20 years.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be placed in a risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel industry consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the metallurgical plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Engles power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland Metallurgical Factory Company is losing money and is at risk of being closed.
These actions have resulted in reflection on the future of the plant, which has been continuing for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which provides electricity to a large aluminium plant from its Loy Young A power plant in Latro-Wally, reported that it was expected that the other three owners would also take steps to avoid the contract.
The factory ' s control share belongs to the Alcoa-Alumia joint short-term venture and the Chinese company CITIC and Marubeni Corp of Japan own less shares.
“The AGL company expects the Portuguese facility to continue operating, i.e. the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not cease”, she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called “hedged contracts”, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month separation period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“As appropriate, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of income in fiscal year 2017,” declared the electricity company.
Whatever the potential impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is limited to projections of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts by $187 million in terms of “pre-emption”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa's ability to run a steel factory or supply electricity to a steel factory”.
An American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Young in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Victorian Portland Metallurgical Plant and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Stephen Mickelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy a year, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts a year.
If both factories leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand for [electronic power].
It would be bad for us as a producer, ” he said.
Not only is the reality show star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of September's Vā
Kendal Jenner, 20, the model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner Mother Chris clan, appeared on the top of September's cover of the American magazine Vigue.
Kendall, who is the face of Este Lauder brander and has defied fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The cover report was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian family?), prepared by a reality-video where the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshires Rob and Caitlin, also associated with them as the world's most beloved uncle of show business, producer of the Kardashian family, Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the sister's appearance on the cover and at the end a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sikrest says, "You thought we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed this glory to get to other girls anyway.
Because with this episode dedicated to September's Vigue, we certainly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
May senior sister Kendall Kim be placed on the cover of Vigue earlier (she appeared with her husband, Kanje West, in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is a achievement on its own.
The September issue is the most widely sold issue of Vigue in a year.
It is more like a gift than a fashion magazine, and it attracts a large number of advertisers. (Fashionista portal accounts that 615 pages of last year’s 832 - page edition contained advertising).
News about who will fall on his cover is so eager that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have merged to the official anons.
Previous women who had been placed on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “semi-workable models” on the cover than “models which are celebrities”.
The Oscar Prize winner and the face of the brand of Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gague took over.
But even if Jenner, described as “the outstanding model” of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of prominent people, reality show stars or modern children who know how to make good videos in Snapchat (though Jenner falls into all these categories).
They're really talented women in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonse, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career with the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
The position of Jenner in the fashion world, because of her past television reality show stars, was always meant to remain fragile.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seamur criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, who called them "the girls of the moment."
These moods were again stirred by the news of Jenner’s appearance on the cover of Vigue.
But there's no point in getting upset.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of September's Vigue.
It's a super-model in every sense.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you the Este Lauder tone cream.
She, and all her sisters, sells your photographs to you in their own paid subscriptions.
She sells her hand-made photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter in LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, perhaps to still see her sister Cortney and her children, she's involved in reality shows on television.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected members of the population are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding for already-performing activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to combat unjust deprivation of property and so on — have been refused in an effort to obtain free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside of reach are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres have had to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Law Centres, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people are being refused a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government ' s decision was not reversed, the situation would only deteriorate.
“Central legal centres of Queensland are constantly underfunded: that means that thousands of people are denied essential services they need”, he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and destructive obligations, families passing through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers -- all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will destroy funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, and therefore thousands of less protected Queensland residents will have to deal with difficult legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately reverse these reductions in funding so that people can receive the necessary assistance when faced with legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palau is due to engage in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters was brought to court after the staff member allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump's election headquarters was taken to court: it was alleged that the headquarters did nothing after reported that his operational director in North Carolina threatened a staff member with a gun while they were driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a case brought on Wednesday before the state court at Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said he'd been waiting a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip, "scrolling the gun, putting his right finger on the trigger and pointed the gun on Vincent's knee cup," claims Bordini in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four others had become involved in similar incidents with Philip.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to hurt," said Bordini in a complaint.
The claim took place just two days after the republican party’s presidential candidate presented the furor, telling North Carolina students that “people of the Second Amendment” — understood as arms owners and lovers of them — could begin to function if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could elect judges.
Trump's election staff said that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he had not spoken in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the pre-election staff for careless control, and from Philip for the threat of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow in responding to a request for comment.
Attempts to speak to Philip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to a call from his consulting firm, Innovative Advisory Services, no one quickly called back.
The presidential candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Higher Court of Meklenburg District (Sharlot).
Britain has to put the Olympic spirit into the right direction and expand Hithroa
It will also bring recovery and prosperity, not only in our towns here and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
I believe that was the great advantage of Hithrow, as well as London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have greatly benefited Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do that again by creating opportunities for local residents and firms next to Heathrow.
Only for our towns here will we create 10,000 new interns, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case with London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Hithrow is too extensive.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that must be overcome, but Hithrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Heathrow Olympic Games, it's an infrastructure project for most people, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around the airport as well as across the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, who has introduced a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 — chosen by the best airport terminal for five consecutive years to T2 — built in the middle of the two world's most employed runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympics in London were a great success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hithrow will also be.
The time has come for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand the Hithroa, ensuring our trading future and creating a legacy of the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Hithrow Council and former Trade Attase Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing mouse cats on Adblock
For companies that earn money on the Internet ads, trying to circumvent advertising software is a "bulb" game, according to one company that creates such software.
Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ads on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their program filters to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site changes the billboard around its ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to recognize what parts of the pages are advertising.
But Adblock now says he was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those who are trying to bypass it continues from the moment of the invention of the advertising block”, and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has come into action is a clear indication of the extent to which advertising blockers for industry have become a major problem.
Around 200 million people around the world use advertisers, according to last year ' s study, Pagefire and Adobe; almost four times as many users of such software as 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who visit Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook revenues from advertising.
However, the company is hunting ad blockers on the desktop because mobile advertisers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
Still, ads in the desktop version are a fairly profitable article to make Facebook think of such a step as a good investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its advertising tool to give people more control over how they were being trafficked.
On Thursday Facebook said that Adblock's new filters were disturbing, as they would also block some imprecise content on the website.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem”, stated the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so we've instead focused on creating tools like Advertising preferences to put governance in the hands of people.
The woman was moved to a Swiss highway in an obvious suicide episode
The victim lay on a highway in the middle of the night.
The police call for witnesses after a woman has moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morge in canton V immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman went on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles and reported to the police in a statement.
In an obvious attempt to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died in place.
A number of involved drivers have been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, reported to the police, calling on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case has been initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, and counsel Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneva has stated.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
"That's what the prosecutor has to determine," said Hoftester.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the dark along the highway — it was sentenced that motorists could not expect to see a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of his reckless death after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern the night of August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim was dusted and fainted on the road, listening to the court.
The Court found that a female police officer — who responded to the emergency challenge — managed the vehicle in a way that had been justified and that the existence of a person on the road was “exclusive and unpredictable”, said the judge.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus once lived
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to an estimate of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the village Space Research Institute of Goddard developed a model for the study of Venus's past, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions such as Earth-like conditions could ever exist in Venus, its hot waterless surface and its atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus’s low speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a fragmented atmosphere like the earth and still slowly rotate.
The model also considered early Venus topography.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there were enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early city of Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent more dense.
"In accordance with the GIS model, the slow return of Venus sets it up almost two months at a time," explained a GIS scholar from Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces a rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a significant part of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly several degrees colder than in our time on Earth.
The model shows Venus's history, similar to the development previously envisaged by planet scientists.
Although it may have been inhabited by Venus for several billion years, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans have evaporated and its water vapor has been burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen left, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained — Venus, as we know her today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model, Venus, in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaving the trainer's post for Avalanche
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-President of hockey activities, Colorado Avalanche, on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President / Chief Manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sack, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice-President of hockey activities, Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long and diligent time thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-President of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sack, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
" Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sack.
We appreciate what he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award winner as the best league coach during her first season with Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the plei-off and lost the plei-off in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the struggle for a second concessionary journey to attend the Western Conference.
A fan of the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two from the Montreal Canadiens and one from Avalanche.
The North Sea oils resume negotiations and stop the strike
Work strikes on petroleum salaries in the North Sea have been suspended and a new round of negotiations has been initiated by all parties, and lead representatives of the parties have reported.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were periodically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Good Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes”, the joint statement states.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential reductions of up to 30 per cent in wages.
Woodgroup this year reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent because of the market's negative tensions.
The lower rates on the part of the company resulted from a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for bank employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space necessary to overcome the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega mission with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the declining prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated owing to the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June UK.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our age.
The North Sea, he said, was vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the star at the Pediae
The latest mission of the Space Telescope, Kepler, helped astronomers to compile the most complete set of velocities of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds and how the phases of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," says a press release by Louise Ribal, a scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
A collection of Pleiades is located in 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many stars are now only reaching maturity; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They're turning as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars emit large amounts of starry wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds act as a slowing action on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed starts to slow down.
It measures the speed of each star by tracking the time between recognized star spouts, such as the sun.
The newer speed catalogue suggests that the more massive stars rotate slower than the less massive stars.
Fishball compares stars to dancers: larger pyruates are slower than smaller ones.
"In "Belete," we see that those who rotate slowly, usually more massive, whereas those who rotate faster, usually refer to very light stars," said Rivall.
Since Pleida's collection is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare star and speed properties.
"The Pleiades Star Cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," said Rivall.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow their speed and hang their "Tancial shoes" on a nail, as you would say.
Fishall and her colleagues gave details of their latest analysis of the speed of Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation involving a group of detainees in Crimea, Ukrainian dissidents, is conducted by two departments and writes "Commersant".
The FSB collects evidence of the participation of detainees in preparation for the Crimea diversions.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian town of Energodar Evgenius Panov gave a confession and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
He said that he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armiansk, the oilbasa in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry transport, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that it is far from possible to arrest all diversions.
This, among other things, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Paradise, Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanisław Cherchezov was the main trainer of the Russian soccer team.
The executive meeting of the Russian football Union decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchezov as the leading coach for football in Russia.
It will be contracted for two years, until the end of the CMM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation executive appointed Stanislav Cherchezov to the post of Russia's leading football coach.
This is a famous football player who used to play in the Moscow Spartacus on the position of the devotee, as well as a coach with strong experience, who has been a mentor of Russian teams like Spartacus, Zhemzyna Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinamo, as well as of Warsaw’s Lehia, who has won the country’s national rudimentary and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchezov will be signed as soon as possible for a period of two years.
It is therefore his duty to prepare for the World Championship of 2018.
It is known that Miroslav Romachenko, Gintaras Stoutche, Vladimir Pannikov, will be included in his training staff.
There is information that the entire training staff will pay 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the Russian leadership has set before Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of bringing Russia’s collectives to semi-finals and medals.
As the coach himself has stated, he considers creation of a competitive team environment as a priority and intends to give footballers an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchezov, he is glad that his choice came upon him.
The first match, led by Cherchezov's assembled Russia, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, which will be a social gathering with the Turkish team.
Remember, Leonid Sluskiy, who was former chief coach of Russian football, was involved in his training at the TCSA club.
He declared his resignation after a strong intervention by the Russian national team on Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad outcome he had collected.
In the long struggle against apartheid, Namibia was severely affected by the greed between Angola and South Africa.
Nevertheless, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country has achieved enormous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason Namibia is successful is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education as themselves, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary school fees are required.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce fees for “cost recovery”.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has been free since 2015.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of inequality, Namibia has seen its decline.
In comparison with 1993, the Gini ratio, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also fell, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other wealthy States have far outstriped the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Anti-Corruption Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from the Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 debt levels in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
Unemployment rates, at least in traditional methods of assessment, remain high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is among the countries with income above average, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the deserts of the country, there are isolated nomadic hunter tribes, which must be integrated in one way or another into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought of giving up, and it had solved its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides affordable health care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose neighbours but decided not to conflict with them but to cooperate in sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and student exchange.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth revenues need to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country ' s resources, and they are revising investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, and the strong support of the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As Head of State Hague Gheingob noted, the media often say something he doesn't like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect its freedom, says the President.
Not all of Namibia ' s core resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, were renewable, and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, the colonial order, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on the road to overall prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects ever created by man (4600 - 4,200 B.C.E.).
It must have been the greatest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the excavations of the Varnnen Nepotol, a fantastic number of golden artifacts were found -- more than three thousand of the total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one grave, known as “Milk No. 43”, was recovered from 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient gold world could soon be changed to a blind species of bush found by archaeologists in July this year.
Once again, Bulgaria is a pre-historical settlement known as Tel Yunacité.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunacita is located far from the sea near the village of Yunacita, Pazarjik district.
The bus is a gold strip wrapped in a ring.
Javor Bojadjiev, chief of excavation at Tel Yunacita, dated the discovery of 4,600 years before our Common Era and claimed that she was older than Varna’s gold by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are, recall, dated around the same period, 4,600 to 4,200 years before our Common Era.
There is currently no technology that allows the metal to be date with imprecise accuracy.
How can you be sure of the gold that is older than it is?
Professor Bojadjiev obviously knows more than Reuters said: "I'm pretty sure that the gold of Yunacita is older than the gold of Varna."
It's a finding of extreme importance: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview, Reuters Boyajiev reported that scientists would soon analyse the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with as much precision as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Yunacité is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
At present, Tel Yunacté is considered to be Europe's oldest “city”.
The Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (now Turkey) in the 7,000th century before our Common Era.
During the following centuries, metal processing has been rapidly developing in the region, ranging from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkans-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5,000th century before our Common Era, urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunacité may be the oldest, since the artifacts of 4900 B.C.E. were found here.
I would call Tel Yunacita a prototype of the modern city, even though it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This is a place older than Shumer for a thousand years”, says Bojajiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
There came the first cities in the familiar understanding of the word.
The remains of Tel Yunacité have been under way since 1976.
In the meantime, archaeologists have dug almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
The remains of the fastening wall were found, which at one time reached three meters in height.
Although little remained of the houses and workshops, archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, business centers and residential areas.
Yunacitété is often referred to as Avian City, where dozens of clay figures of birds were found.
All the birds were depicted in peace, hence it was assumed that they were objects of local worship rather than decorative objects.
Avian City was destroyed about 4100 years before our era - possibly by the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
Nomads had cities, but horses and weapons.
The three-metre walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a violent massacre: inside the houses remains of the elderly, women and children with traces of the wounds inflicted by the armed towings have been found.
New findings and new facts emerge every year, changing the traditional notions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking, not of individual cultures, but of the “lost” first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to seek this civilization was “golden Varna”, found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury was supposed to be something ahead of us -- something like a tiny gold bush created in Tel Yunacita.
Porsche artificially aged model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by units that work with serial machines.
"Retro-Luck" is, for example, a special color for Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, and in this color, even the logo of the model is painted.
In addition, the Targa was given a regular white schedule along the sides and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drive, as well as some of the body design details in the “white gold metal”.
In the interior of the retro-thrill, there is a marked decrease: it differs, on a large account, from the gray-blue gamma structure, to the new seats with extended electrical configurations and separate black anodated steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, each buyer will receive a gift of car Czechol and a rich cut-off album with photographs of the production process when buying a special version.
The Porsche Exclusive equipment does not touch steel: the retro-tar by characteristics is very similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbo-dumping capacity of 3.0 l, which develops 420 l.s. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with a limited circulation, but neither the amount nor the cost of each particular sports car will be reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers have unleashed an arms race
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent ads from being hidden on social media pages has prompted decision makers to block ads for response.
AdBlock Plus released an anti-poison, but Facebook is about to make it useless.
So AdBlock Plus has advocated its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The social media noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of “unblocked” advertising, the decision of AdBlock Plus, together with commercial advertisements, also blocked many of the normal positions of friends or pages.
Facebook regretted AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source from the social media industry TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook descott site will be ready in the next hours.
Thus, social media and blockers have unleashed a kind of “arms race” in an attempt to play each other, while the affected party has been users who have missed interesting recordings from friends or seen ads where they have not been used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of the advertising block have recently been a source of hot controversy.
In Murmansk, the abuser will be brought to trial at night Murmansk.
His case had already been completed in the Russian Federation ' s Investigative Committee on the Murman Region.
The alleged charges against a 54-year-old man are very serious: sexual violence.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the Paula Street area in Murmansk had committed sexual acts involving violence against a 20-year-old girl. A criminal case with an approved indictment was referred to the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring Crossven Fengguang 370 and Rich New pickup to Russia - www.zr.ru Web site
Dongfeng Fengguang 370, representative of China's most popular vehicle class, which combines the dignity of minivan and cross-soverere.
Another declared Russian Prime Minister is Rich New.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Motor Vehicle this year have decided to ignore, so the empty “Croccus Expo” exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, with large species on the Russian market, will be a powerful front and will offer some interesting news to our car lovers in the near future.
One will be Prince Dongfeng Fengguang 370 sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 Yuan (almost less than 550,000 roubles at current rates).
Such a pricer is unlikely to shine to Russia, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sales, was able to reach the 11th place on the list of the most sold minivans, although in view of the large road light (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it could well be counted on to cross-sowers.
Crossven is built on the front-end platform of the Fengguang 360 younger model, with 370 of the same wheel base of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The Salon was decorated with wooden tablets, but the large vertical sensory display shown in the photo "like "Tasla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition pieces of the crossword, and the cars were sold with "music" easier.
Five of the seven landing places shall be easily formed, forming a level loading area of 1,650 mm long, with a maximum capacity of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine is only one 1.5-litre petrol "atmosphere" with a power of 115 l.s. with a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer’s dynamic qualities are modest, but he promises a generous appetite budget of 6.7 l/100 km.
Picape Rich New is a well-known Russianman, Nissan NP300 Navara, a generation gone, but with a little bit of frigging Chinese stickler design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys the steady demand of a Chinese consumer as a reliable and reluctant “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New would certainly be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: 2.4 l (137 l) petrol or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 l).
The gearbox is only a mechanics, the transmission is to the rear wheels, but there are modifications and hard-on front.
It will be at Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9 and its Russian Prime Mission of the Chinese firm will be accredited as early as June.
Minten-like cross-servers on the Chinese market are increasing, one of the latest is to say, "Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Dongfeng Russian line currently consists of two models: sedan S30 and Hetzbeka H30 Cross.
In seven months of this year, Chinese dealers carried out 696 vehicles in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail to www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate changed the way in which notices of property taxes were sent.
All Russian carowners are accustomed to a non-changing year scheme: in summer and autumn, they receive a receipt from the mail to pay the transportation tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not wait this year.
The fact is, the tax inspectorate has changed the order of the citizens' notice without too much noise.
Those who are registered with the taxpayer's Personal Office on the official website of Nalog.ru will receive notice electronically.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and removed them from a standard, paper-based distribution.
The news will affect all owners of vehicles and real estates.
All others will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, it is possible to get back to the old scheme, too, with the account holders on the website.
To that end, they would have to visit the tax office during the month of August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notice will appear in the “person's office” immediately after writing, while the letter will take several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service has dropped over 18 million people, allowing the agency to make serious savings on the mailing list.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some were able to register in the “person's office” for a single service and had long forgotten to do so.
They will not wait for the news by mail, nor will they go into the category of non - payers, with all the consequences involved.
Access to the taxpayer's Personal Office is made in three ways: through the recording of the goussulugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or entry of the logic and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (whether or not the place where the accounting is made).
We recall that this year ' s transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
The notices began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve very high performance, is a thing of itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the G- consistingrs who started modifying Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
In fact, why not improve G 63 - 571-strong flying quartz with aerodynamic tank and a race of up to a hundred for 5.4 seconds?
The artist's "mouscules" of the crazy "gealic" took advantage of the benefits of a 5.5-litre inflatable eight-year-old.
And so the drive to hundreds of feet has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 seconds, and now the flying "crap" is capable of taking 5.3 seconds.
However, it is certainly better to accelerate from medium speed.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h, then a tuner with a deactivated electronic collar is able to push 250 km/h.
The vehicle is practically indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheel discs - 23-inch Herricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Luke unit has documented an amazing concept pile of 6 m long, which will be represented in the Pelble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is about to compete with the Green Subbrand BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade name.
A minimum of four environmentally friendly developments are expected in the coming years.
